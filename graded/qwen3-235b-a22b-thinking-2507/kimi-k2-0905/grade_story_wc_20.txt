<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through alchemical precision ("balance—alchemist’s balance, heart-balance") and embodied grief (tears adding weight to scales). Caelum’s absence creates potent negative space, though his character lacks full dimensionality despite pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "calibrated weight of understanding" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("tears added a twentieth"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each "limit" deepens the stake without causal gaps, culminating in resonant foundry transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry functions as active constraint: anvil’s warmth enables steam reactions, gutters’ silver sets alchemical tone, rust becomes raw material. Final image of "cracks glowing with gold" charges closure through environment-as-character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (can names be redeemed?) escalates through Aurelia’s agency: weighing Caelum’s name, calcining regret, binding memory. Cost is visceral in "tears added a twentieth" and the coin’s transformation from burden to "measurement."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from alchemy: "names are not chains but counterweights" avoids moralizing by crystallizing through the mended coin. Final line’s "luminous regret" reweights redemption as process, not destination, with no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("syllables pool like mercury," "gutters ran silver"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (staccato during gold application). Zero head-hopping; every image filtered through alchemist’s embodied cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rose-gold vapor condensing into a seam of living gold" achieves maximal density. Final line’s "silent syllabus" avoids abstraction through concrete image. One near-miss: "zodiac coin clinked once" slightly over-engineered but saved by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through grief mechanics: "weight of names" premise feels fresh via tangible acts (weighing breaths, welding with starlight). Avoids sentimentality by grounding redemption in physical constraints (trembling hands, storm-water reflections).</comment>
