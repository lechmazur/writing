<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied grief ("syllables heavier than any crucible"); contradictory impulses crystallize in the mirror scene where he both seeks and fears her reflection. Final choice to roll the silver tube earns closure through irreversible physical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("grief on one side, love on the other"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as ritual intensifies pressure. Orientation clear by line 1 ("rain-washed foundry"), cost legible in hollow coin's final song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Foundry actively constrains choices: rain hissing through roof shapes the mirror's formation. Micro-setting triumph—"cedar splints" used for burning letter later flavors well water, charging final image with tactile continuity that defines the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as each ritual intensifies "weight of names" concept; agency clear in pouring silver on wet floor. Cost unmistakable when mirror cracks along her birth constellation, reconfiguring options through irreversible action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi literally practiced on the mirror, avoiding moralizing. Final image of silver-flecked children reweights "luminous regret" into generative hope without stating morals, satisfying 9+ quick test via resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "luminous regret that dripped from windowpanes"—grief made tangible through alchemist's sensory lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure: short sentences during crucible pour ("Understanding flooded him") heighten urgency without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "cedar splints" does triple duty establishing smell/tool/payoff. Final line’s abrupt cutoff ("moon crawls through the") avoids overwriting while charging closure. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the cracking mirror.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/kintsugi avoids grief tropes through specific details ("teeth of stamping press"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—well water tasting of "cedar and birthdays" transforms abstract theme into visceral, earned twist.</comment>
