<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (defying gravity yet seeking weight) and embodied emotion (temporal papercuts leaking hours) powerfully under pressure; final choice to erase the minotaur feels earned through procedural generation's failure, though the "stitched from every moment" explanation slightly over-tells the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when timelines collapse into the ripple's doorway—a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost (erased selves); the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as density intensifies through fracture progression to the sigh of timelines closing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct’s cobalt algae and inverted rain aren’t backdrop but active constraints: neon-rain algae enables backward-running fractures, while copper-tasting air anchors sensory urgency; the tablet’s runes charging the final image ("birds of fired clay") elevates this beyond vivid description to micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Kael’s agency—retracing via procedural generation forces ghost-choices, then the algorithm’s hiccup compels walking through the fracture; cost is visceral as temporal papercuts leak "yesterday" while the elder Kael’s dissolution makes the price of conquering the labyrinth undeniably felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the clock-collecting father’s futile hope ("if enough timepieces died, one might stay alive") reframes the labyrinth conquest as rejecting fractured selves; the final doorway avoids moralizing by showing Kael walking toward his younger self with clocks ticking backward—a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rainwater bead and fall upward," "runes pulsing like dying stars") reflects Kael’s physics-defying state; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with fragmented clauses during fracture traversal ("He walked the center path because the tablet’s runes spelled 'you'"), teaching elision early through procedural generation’s ghost-steps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where "temporal papercuts across his forearms" compresses time-loss into physicality. Near-closure, "runes rearranged into the shape of his childhood bedroom" risks metaphor crowding but avoids muddle through concrete anchors ("wallpaper peeling like sunburned skin").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-labyrinth tropes via the tablet’s "periodically eternal" mechanics and gravity defiance as negotiation (not rebellion); the ripple’s doorway revealing backward-ticking clocks feels inevitable yet fresh—a synthesis where specific rules (procedural ghosts, temporal papercuts) heighten emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
