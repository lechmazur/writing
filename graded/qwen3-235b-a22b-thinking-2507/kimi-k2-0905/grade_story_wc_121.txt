<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("conquer labyrinth of self") clear but slightly abstract; embodied emotion strong via temporal papercuts and procedural choices, though "minotaur" metaphor edges toward thematic echo in elder Kael's whisper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: drop touching water reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (selves left behind); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic escalation of fractures and arches without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct constrains every choice (17 arches navigation, edge risk) and charges final image; "copper pennies/ozone" detail filters through Kael's urgency, evolving from cobalt to ordinary rain at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (conquering self-labyrinth) tightens through ghost-Kaels and arches, forcing micro-choices with visible cost (temporal papercuts); elder Kael crystallizes moral calculus without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("paper map recognizing world is round") reweights "labyrinth" theme non-literally; avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in concrete action (tablet smash) and dissolving selves, with no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("algae bred by neon rain lighting arches like cathedral bones"); rhythmic compression under pressure (short sentences during fracture crossing) heightens tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "temporal papercuts" and "yesterday puddling" demonstrate high-density propulsion. Minor over-embellishment in "runes rearranged into childhood bedroom" barely dents peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "periodically eternal" tablet transforms time-travel tropes via procedural generation mechanics; risk-taking (fractured selves as stakes) heightens coherence without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
