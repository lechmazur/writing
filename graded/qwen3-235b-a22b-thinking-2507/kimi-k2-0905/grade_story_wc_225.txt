<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: winnowing shame via maze-walking, not abstract reflection. Micro-choice of righting the king crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost in the village's inhalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost: the exhale perturbing enchantment proves inner shift, while thunder's delayed roll embodies consequence held then released. Lens (Accumulative) holds through final thread-lifting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tapestry threads constrain decoding action and charge closure as "script no longer needed." Platinum labyrinth physically maps regret, transforming from puzzle to mirror that shapes the climax's footstep-by-footstep winnowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake (self-forgiveness) tightens via Marek's agency: decoding threads forces stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—each maze step separates "useless remorse," made undeniable by the village's restored breath after king-righting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("board wider than mistake") reweights chess metaphors into earned wisdom without moralizing. Threads lifting as "script no longer needed" resonates as non-literal answer to guilt, avoiding thematic echo despite profound insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is chess-player specific: stormlight on labyrinth "glinting," thunder "matching the board." Syntax compresses under pressure ("He set up the position in his mind") without sacrificing rhythmic control or POV coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed threads" metaphor evolves without muddle. Final line’s semicolon rhythm ("prayer, like promise, like the beginning") propels closure while recharging motifs. No artifacts in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms frozen-time trope through chess logic: "king walking alone" sequence makes regret tangible. Risk of quiet closure pays off—theory ("winnowing") becomes embodied action (maze-walking) with emotional specificity no template matches.</comment>
