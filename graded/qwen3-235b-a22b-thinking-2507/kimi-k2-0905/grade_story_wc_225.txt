<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marek’s guilt manifests physically ("knuckles blanched") and through contradictory impulses (seeking penance via geometry while avoiding direct remorse). His micro-choice to decode tapestry threads—not solve the labyrinth—earns the climax. Backstory avoids therapy-speak by anchoring to chess ("rehearsing variations until mind sees board rather than shame").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "village inhale" and "thunder finally rolled" crystallize emotional release. Accumulative lens holds via textile/chess motif density—tapestry decoding deepens the labyrinth’s meaning without causal turns. Orientation flawless ("exiled chess tutor" + "time-frozen village" by word 10).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains choice (Marek walks it physically after realizing it’s a "mirror" of regret) and charges closure ("king smiling" reconfigured as acceptance). Frayed tapestry threads function as micro-setting, directly enabling the decoding action that shifts the enchantment. Final image ties threads lifting to "frayed thread guide hand back to whole weave."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately: "winnow guilt from memory." Escalation via Marek’s agency—decoding the suicidal king sequence reveals forgiveness requires reframing, not solving. Cost legible in "thunder finally rolled," translating emotional release into sensory consequence. Single tightening (labyrinth as mirror realization) forecloses the "solve" path under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess metaphors transformed: "The board is wider than the mistake" avoids moralizing by sounding like "prayer, promise, beginning of class." Central question (can loss become instructive?) answered by the checkmated king smiling—a resonant, non-literal image recharging "woven hush" into movement. No thematic echo; wisdom arises from tapestry’s "stitch-code."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chess tutor’s analytical eye ("algebraic coordinates," "gambit") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates under pressure—fragmented decoding ("e4…d6…Nf3…Qg5…") versus flowing climax sentences. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during decoding ("phantom king advance").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold—tapestry threads reappear with reweighted meaning ("carrying decoded game into sky"). High density: "woven hush lay over cobblestones like thick felt" establishes atmosphere, metaphor, and foreshadowing. Final line’s "frayed thread" recharges opening motif without muddle. No figurative overwriting in peak beats (decoding sequence).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess metaphors reimagined as emotional framework ("fierce repose" as "predatory clarity"). Transformation test fails if changed to non-chess tutor—tapestry’s algebraic notation requires specific expertise. Risk-taking: entire plot hinges on decoding textile patterns as game notation, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
