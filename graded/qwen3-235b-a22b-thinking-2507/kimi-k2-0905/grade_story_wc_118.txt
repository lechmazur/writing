<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied perception ("pulse answered," "floor tilt") but lacks flawed contradiction; motivation clear yet solitude's cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally demonstrated during the axis shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "traded her final solitude" and blank tapestry deliver undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds as diary discoveries tighten the axis motif toward the silo's realignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Silo concrete actively constrains choice (selecting "smoothest stretch" for tapestry) and charges closure as dragons transfer to walls; micro-setting elevates beyond backdrop to narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from finding stories to locating the displaced axis via diary revelations; "loose stone" deepening narrows options, with solitude's tradeoff felt in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: walls gaining voice answers "who carries stories?" without moralizing; final vibration image reweights prior material as "wings uncurling" replaces human dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of cooled ember") with rhythmic control under pressure; compression during discoveries ("pages peeled away") heightens immediacy without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere ("spine cracked like a scream") with peak-beat clarity during tapestry transfer; only microscopic strain in "cylinder of night" avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through stone-sensitivity and narrative gravity; "displaced axis" concept feels inevitable in hindsight with emotional specificity avoiding derivative solitude clichés.</comment>
