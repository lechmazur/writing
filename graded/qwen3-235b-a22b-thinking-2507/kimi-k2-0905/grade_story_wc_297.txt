<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "anxious elation" and scar-as-door philosophy; the gardener confrontation crystallizes values with palpable cost when protagonist rejects pruning/grafting for "the green minute." Final choice feels earned through embodied history like maplines burned by falling stars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the glade became a constellation of miniature suns" reconfigures the covenant as photosynthesis with visible cost (permanent scar-hedge). Accumulative lens holds through the glade's transformation from shimmering dusk to nameless-color deepening, each beat tightening the dream-land symbiosis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scar-hedge blooming cobalt flower charges the final image while constraining choice—its "whispering turns" force ongoing covenant stewardship. Glade's cobalt light evolves from atmospheric shimmer to living currency ("giving directions only I could read"), grounding cosmic stakes in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: pressing clipping against scar actively triggers the maze transition. Cost crystallizes when the hedge roots permanently in their palm—no soft reset. But the gardener's binary question ("prune or graft?") slightly oversimplifies the thematic nuance of "the green minute" resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The final cobalt flowers reweight the "eclipsed covenant" as living reciprocity ("feed the sky our fears, it will feed us new hours") without moralizing. Theme emerges from scar-hedges bowing silently—a resonant answer to time's broken promise that avoids tidy binaries while honoring loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "root-bound visionary" and "sky that no longer pressed but accompanied." Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—lyrical density thins during the maze's "indigo corridors that breathe," then crystallizes into the gardener's midnight shears confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "pulsing like a heart that remembered every turn" exemplifies high-density imagery. One paraphrase loop: "anxious elation rose... settled into steady pulse" slightly echoes earlier tension, but rhythm variation ("thunder feels when you realize it is only the sky’s heartbeat") maintains propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-recovery tropes through scar-hedges and "paved time over growing it." Emotional specificity in "the face of the friend who died before we met" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—each shard deepens the covenant's cost.</comment>
