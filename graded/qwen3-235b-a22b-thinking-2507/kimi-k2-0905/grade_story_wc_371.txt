<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete choices ("heuristically gentle" bread handling), but gardener’s sudden appearance lacks motivation; final renunciation (cultivating sacred ordinary) earned through crumbs-to-herbs progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when mosaics "uncloak" the bakery—cost legible in "tears salting the crust" at reopened shop; Accumulative lens holds via bread-planting pattern, though tea house transition slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Palace courtyard actively constrains choices (digging holes, tea-steam confessions); "breadcrust armor" shoots charge final image, making environment indispensable to closure’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mila’s planting agency—each buried loaf narrows options as "commuters stepped around them without seeing"; cost crystallizes when ordinary bread tastes of "sacred continuous" with salted tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "basil spelling shop names," avoiding moralizing; final image ("every ordinary doorway possible altar") offers non-literal answer to memory loss, reweighting "creeping normality" as cultivable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("flour ghosts," "heuristically gentle") creates rhythmic control; voice modulates from hushed observation ("wind and distant traffic") to charged intimacy ("tea-steam sighs") without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "Pain d’Amande" awning does triple duty (setting, loss, hope); only minor register drift in "absolution" repetition, but earned through context and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gardening-as-memory-resistance transforms urban decay tropes; "bread-born herbs spelling old shop names" is specific, inevitable synthesis where risk-taking (magic realism) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
