<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in 'gap between knowing and understanding' drives micro-choices; final seed-uprooting earned through musical stakes. Lacks visceral internal clash at climax for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via statues rooting into trees with undeniable cost; Accumulative lens holds through musical pattern escalation. Midpoint lens clarity slightly fuzzy but redeemed by final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Locust shell constrains every choice and charges the final seed-hum; 'tarnished wonder' sensory hierarchy reflects Calla's urgency. Micro-setting as essential environment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seed's transformation: beauty travels 'on its own legs' as non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; 'tarnished wonder' sustains complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in 'breath tasted of iron and apricot'; rhythmic control mirrors violin dynamics. No head-hopping; elision taught through locust shell memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; 'tarnished wonder' metaphor risks muddle but pays off in closure. Final line 'heartbeat of a world learning to break free' avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>'Tarnished wonder' synthesizes mechanical/orchard tension; risk-taking (music reversing gravity) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in statues' smiling.</comment>
