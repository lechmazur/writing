<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: she fears "exhausting the world’s longing" yet writes because "understanding outweighed caution," embodied through wrist-bone vibrations and graphite-poised tension. Final choice (launching the glider) is causally earned by her forged-history practice, with visible cost in "heart heavier by one truth."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors crisply by line 3 (who/where/when). Closure lands as Charged Poise: "silence was seeded" reconfigures absence into potential with conceptual cost (history as pruned bonsai), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Lamp dimming to "ember" proves discharge of duty—exact cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth constrains choice by rearranging paths and "speaking" textures; lamp’s hum (C-sharp) becomes tactile pressure when vibration travels through bones. Final image of "silence seeded" charges setting as living archive, with micro-setting (lamp) directly shaping climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when bonsai "speaks" textures matching her forgeries—pressure shifts from collection to creation as she realizes "labyrinth was reading her inventories." Cost crystallizes in tearing the sheet: glider’s ignition transforms silence into "seeded" potential, driven by her agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "history is a bonsai, pruned by desire" shown via transforming trees, not stated. Final image ("silence ready to bloom") answers central question with resonant ambiguity—no moralizing, only the weight of "counterfeit decades" fertilizing truth. Complexity avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "velvet of 1912, grit of 2077" filters time through tactile memory. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during transformation ("She tried to stop"), lyrical flow in description. Zero head-hopping; deep third POV maintains "incandescent restraint" lexicon throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "footprints recording minutes the way a sunday records hymns" achieves density without muddle. Final paragraph’s "silence was seeded" crystallizes closure with crystalline precision—no figurative clutter in peak beats. Opening/final lines resonate ("battered notepad" to "blank sheets... ready to bloom").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "textures of different times" as forgery material transforms tropes of time manipulation. Transformation test passes—changing "gilded-leaf stationer" to "blacksmith" would collapse bonsai/lamp logic. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universals in specific tactile detail.</comment>
