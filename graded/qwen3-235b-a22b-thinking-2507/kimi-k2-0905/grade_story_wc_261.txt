<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "scars are simply stories written sideways" revelation, but sister's absence limits relationship crucible; micro-choices like tracing coffee rings ground motivation despite near-epiphany abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost in "heavier by one story" and steady pulse—lens holds as accumulative pressure crystallizes in seed-swallowing; red-sand hourglass reconfiguration charges the final image irreversibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coffee rings as micro-setting constrain choice (tracing direction alters tunnel access) and charge closure via final seed placement; loam-stone transformation exemplifies environment dictating tactics under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: reopening wound forecloses avoidance path, with blood-as-syllable cost altering tactics; serum's fading telepathy creates tangible time pressure for the final whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "scars as sideways stories" motif, with final whisper "teach silence to speak kindly" offering resonant, non-literal answer—no moralizing, only earned subtext in swallowed seed carrying laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting iron and lilac," "meteor hush") modulates under stress with rhythmic compression during descent; zero head-hopping despite plant telepathy, voice remains anchored in embodied urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—each line multi-tasks ("tannic grooves became a tunnel I could fall through" merges setting/emotion)—but "chlorophyll code" slightly strains botanical metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scar-reading with plant telepathy feels inevitable; risk-taking in coffee-ring tunnel method heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming wound closure into period rather than question mark.</comment>
