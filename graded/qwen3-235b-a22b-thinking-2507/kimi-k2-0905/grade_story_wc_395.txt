<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (corporate loyalty vs truth-seeking) act simultaneously in scene; final sacrifice earned by prior causality with visible cost (pixelating badge photo). Mother’s hologram crystallizes motivation without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable conceptual cost (erasure from payroll), causal lens held rigorously. Firewall bargain creates legitimate trade-off; Earned Stasis in singing reconfigures absence into resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Server farm micro-setting constrains choice (humming blocks guiding path) and charges final image (empty Block 73 singing). Polar ice location essential for "frozen cold cases" logic; lullaby frequency mechanic elevates beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: lie enables access, patch analysis drives discovery, palm-touch choice forecloses employment. Cost unmistakable in badge photo pixelating mid-crisis; moral calculus sharpens peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Final image of empty Block 73 "singing back" offers resonant answer to memory’s cost without moralizing. Theme emerges through lullaby’s evolution from personal artifact to collective resistance; avoids thematic echo via hologram revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("timestamps pulsed like dying stars") distinct under pressure; syntax modulates from lyrical ("ghost—blank squares") to staccato ("She pressed her palm"). Zero head-hopping; tech lexicon stays plausible within POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; high density ("search bar auto-completed a hashtag she had never typed—#Aurora73"). Final line recharges "echo" motif flawlessly; no figurative muddle in climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data exploitation as modern tragedy; "data ghosts" twist transforms missing persons trope. Risk-taking (keeper becoming memory) heightens stakes coherently; emotional specificity avoids generic dystopia.</comment>
