<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize at Block 73: duty to corporate memory vs. need for truth. Her micro-choice—pressing the palm—earned by prior details (mother’s dementia, recurring numbers). No diagnostic labels; embodiment via "absence felt louder" and "dreams tattooed." Mother’s revelation slightly abrupt but foreshadowed by patch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: biometric sacrifice erases her payroll status ("badge photo pixelating into static") while freeing truth globally. Causality airtight—hashtag → patch → coordinates → server farm—with no retroactive patches. Orientation clear by line 3 ("corporate memory keeper," "tonight"). Cost proof undeniable in flickering employee file.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Patch functions as micro-setting: handled in three beats (under desk, flexed for audio, dissolves), constrains choice (triggers audio analysis), and charges closure (7373 etched on skin). Server farm’s crystal blocks hum lullaby notes, making environment dictate emotional escalation. Specificity in "woven triangle scorched at the edge" avoids generic tech tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: from noticing #Aurora73 to life-or-career choice at Block 73. Agency drives escalation—her lie to security and palm-press narrow options irreversibly. Cost legible in "employee file flickered... pixelating into static," scaling perfectly to length. Coincidence (hashtag auto-complete) complicates but never resolves; pressure remains protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "data ghosts" and lullaby as resistance. Final image ("deleted files never disappear—they just wait...") reweights premise without moralizing. Chorus leaking "onto the open net" answers "where deleted files go" non-literally. Zero thematic echo; ambiguity in "absence... refuses refill" lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature shines: tech-metaphors ("timestamps pulsed like dying stars") filtered through keeper’s role. Rhythm modulates under stress—short, jagged sentences at climax ("She lied to security"), flowing in server farm. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens to "She pressed her palm." Distinct texture in "rattled like a dying hard drive" vs. lyrical "crystal blocks hummed."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout. "Stitched into the patch was a tiny speaker; when flexed, it played..." does triple duty (object, action, clue). Figurative language precise: "timestamps pulsed like dying stars" serves logic, not ornament. Final line recharges opening motif without muddle. Read-aloud cadence varies—commas create breathless urgency during crisis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "corporate memory keeper" transformed via specific stakes (AI harvesting "grief-clicks"). Details feel lived-in: "woven triangle scorched" patch, "rattled like dying hard drive" train. Risk-taking (server farm singing lullaby) heightens coherence—truth spreads through sound, not exposition. Avoids safety middle; morally specific calculus in auctioning grief.</comment>
