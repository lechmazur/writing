<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "fear dressed as certainty" crystallizes contradictory impulses. Final renunciation of flute earns cost through prior causality, though backstory about ash-wind feels slightly told rather than shown in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the mirror reflection delivers conceptual cost ("failure is still growing") with visible price of silence paid in advance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through atmospheric pressure build without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon hush constrains Kaelen’s pivotal choice (breathing through flute instead of playing), while the driftwood spiral actively reconfigures at climax. Final image’s "avalanchingly quiet" charges closure by transforming setting into thematic price.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kaelen’s agency: shifting from playing to breathing through the flute narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "silence paid in advance" and the flute’s final claiming by quiet, though the ash-wind backstory’s impact feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "truest weaving is the unweaving" reweights the premise without moralizing. The reflection’s "failure is still growing" delivers non-literal answer to central question via earned resonance, avoiding thematic echo through visceral imagery (ash like reverse snow).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in textural diction ("velvet-buried quiet," "salt-smooth wood"), modulating rhythm under pressure. Only slight flaw: "catacombs" metaphor risks overwriting but remains voice-coherent within the hush motif’s accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "avalanchingly quiet" refrain teaches pattern early and pays off in closure. Figurative language ("time pools like dead birds") charges meaning without muddle, though "catacombs" in high-pressure beat slightly edges toward overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms relic-keeper trope through specific failure (opening rift to Barren) and "unweaving" insight. Avoids derivative fantasy via sensory deprivation mechanics, but the "mirror" resolution slightly echoes familiar portal tropes despite fresh execution.</comment>
