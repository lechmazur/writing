<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her methodical process masking emotional vulnerability; the pivotal lancing of the heel reveals hierarchy of values (truth vs. self-preservation) with embodied cost when pigment drips, triggering the water's revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: painted/tangible Elias facing each other crystallizes the town’s amnesia with conceptual cost (bodies recovered, empathy awakened); the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density (gardenia scent, warming canvas) that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quarry setting constrains every choice—from boots grinding limestone to floodlights guiding reflection painting; the "furrowed hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to charge the final image where water clears, fulfilling the 9+ gate via environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: mixing ribbon fibers into pigment narrows options to one irreversible act (lancing the heel), paying visible cost (water revealing mask); the dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens through her methodical process, with gardenia scent deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the mask’s revelation: "faces ready at last to be seen" reweights the premise without moralizing; the artist’s erased faces versus recovered bodies creates resonant ambiguity about memory’s cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mapping tremor of a jaw muscle" and "silence has a shape like any jawline"; rhythmic control under pressure via compressed syntax during the lancing beat, with all elision (e.g., backstory fragments) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ribbon-black" and "furrowed hush" integrate symbolism without muddle; high density in the lancing sequence ("released a bead of pigment that rolled...") propels momentum while charging closure—no figurative overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blindness as investigative tool transforms true-crime tropes; the quarry’s "furrowed hush" and methodical pigment-mixing feel inevitable, with risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
