<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (giving life years vs. mission urgency) drive closure with embodied cost; time traveler’s thin characterization slightly limits relationship-as-crucible despite functional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (year transferred to time traveler’s chest); causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds through crystallized final image of clematis pointing to "tomorrow’s gap".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Botanical diary as micro-setting constrains every choice (paper compass, verbena seeds) and charges the final image (ink drying into seed); mountain’s roots dictate spatial logic and closure stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: "ignorance flowering into war" tightens to immediate cost (life-year sacrifice); pressure coheres via linguistic constraints reweighting options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "absences" replanting and cello chord in historians’ dreams; avoids moralizing while reweighting "rescue missions never end" via final seed metaphor with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in linguistic synesthesia ("air tasted of unheard symphony"); rhythmic control under pressure ("time hiccuped; the paragraph snapped") with no head-hopping in hybrid focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor density overload in early beats ("faint chords of forgotten languages that hummed") slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise flawless line-level craft with zero loops and strategic telling in transitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis (botanical linguistics, unlearned lessons); risk-taking in structural lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry while maintaining causal coherence.</comment>
