<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "opposite" identity clashing with her ritual—tapping burned forearm in Morse code embodies struggle without therapy-speak. Slight tell in "unyielding compassion" label before full dramatization costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: her promise to bring saplings forecloses escape with visible cost (the persistent burn), while the lagoon's "kelp-drift peace" reconfigures meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost proof evident in "tapping burned forearm" Morse code.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges closure—Mara pours its water for grafting, then internalizes its "kelp-drift peace" as "cool salt tide" that "teaches burn to harmonize," directly constraining her emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency when memory of father's dolphin lighter forces choice: she "breathes down anger" imagining lagoon soaking heat, transforming "scars scream" to "scars sing" with felt cost in rippled forearm. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: grafting black sand becomes non-literal answer to "can scars sing?" Final image of coin as "dark moon on red orbit" reweights shame/companionship without moralizing—no thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is firefighter-specific ("counting stars like sprinkler heads"), with rhythmic compression under stress ("A gull cried... Mara flinched"). Zero head-hopping; tense/stance stable even during reflective shards anchored to physical cues like the trench.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density: "sand clung to gloves like guilty fingerprints" merges action/image/emotion. Minor deduction for "unyielding compassion" label preceding embodiment, but swiftly redeemed in grafting ritual without scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms arsonist/fighter duality through specific ritual (drachma coin as "listening heart"), avoiding template plots. Risk-taking in quiet closure ("salute neither proud nor ashamed") heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
