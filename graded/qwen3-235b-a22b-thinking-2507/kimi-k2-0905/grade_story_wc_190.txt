<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nilo's micro-choice to slow the gondola reveals contradictory impulses (duty vs compassion) under pressure; commuter's fear confession earns closure through embodied cost ("lighter by one confession"). Interiority avoids therapy-speak via concrete sensory anchors like the brass dial's twitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Nilo's return to waiting holds visible cost (commuter's transformed exit, sealed fear in vial). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase ("prisms catching starlight" to "breathing corridor"), with cost legible in "dial sighed back to twenty" and the terrace's exhalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its motion ("lagged behind its own shadow") and final mirroring of clouds constrain choices and reconfigure the sky into a "breathing corridor." Storm glass vial's evolution from violet to clear directly shapes the confession beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening through Nilo's agency: slowing the gondola narrows options (delaying transit to comfort commuter), altering tactics with visible cost (commuter's decibel drop from 30→26). Dominant stake (silence as emotional container) intensifies via the storm glass countdown, foreclosing avoidance with felt cost in the sealed fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: "silence cradle motion" crystallizes in Nilo's throttling to neutral and the final "breathing corridor" image. Ending reweights the premise without moralizing—commuter's fear confession becomes "a new weather born," answering the central question through charged specifics ("child stops searching").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Nilo's sound-focused POV ("glass bricks humming," "dial twitching like conscience") modulates rhythm from lyrical ("frozen sigh") to staccato tension ("thirty decibels—his pulse drumming"). Zero head-hopping; compression ("He needed no ticket") taught early and paid off in the closure's "vaulting hush."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels: "wind, previously a hushed seamstress, now slipped needles through lattice walls" merges setting, tension, and metaphor without muddle. Final line's "catalyze whatever noise or stillness" recharges the opening with crystalline precision, avoiding closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-therapy with sky-gondola mechanics transforms trope through specific constraints (27-decibel limit, crystal hexagons). Risk-taking in quiet closure ("tuned dial to zero") heightens stakes without gimmickry; commuter's fear ("child stops searching") avoids generic abstraction via visceral specificity.</comment>
