<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (throttle adjustment to match commuter's pulse), but the 27-decibel rule borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient character-particular degradation under stress during the confession climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "terrace steadied, as if the sky itself exhaled" crystallizes the cost of voiced fear with conceptual weight, and the Accumulative lens holds through escalating sensory density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the storm glass vial constrains every key choice (departure timing, confession trigger) and charges the final image with "faint silhouettes of every fear," transforming environment into active emotional machinery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative pressure—wind "slipping needles," decibel dial jumps—reweights the silence/stake with visceral cost; commuter's confession at 26dB forecloses emotional isolation through agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (throttling to match pulse, crystallized fear as "new weather"); final image of Nilo tuning to zero decibels offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind... slipped needles through lattice walls") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, with commuter's fear filtered entirely through Nilo's embodied observation and micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fluidly logical script" risks overwriting but anchors in storm glass mechanics. Final line recharges "catalyze" with conceptual precision, and every sentence advances atmosphere without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms confession ritual through specific mechanics (decibel dial, hexagon crystals); prism terrace as "breathing corridor" synthesizes transport/silence into fresh emotional logic without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
