<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "truthful lies" micro-choices (e.g., prism warming at first lie), with embodied emotion in frost-braille reading. Slight deduction for marginally over-poetic abstraction in "grief could be poured into things," though offset by concrete hush/frost mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian's "repositioned" fracture and the cleared window expose cost without resolution. Accumulative escalation—frost patterns deepening, prism flaring—reweights grief's physicality relentlessly. Only hairline slip: "assumptions shatter" slightly abstract until prism fracture pays it off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and car window function as micro-setting constraints: frost veins dictate scraping patterns, dashboard plastic absorbs fear. Final image (glinting arbor, melting initials) charges closure through mineral resonance. No decorative detail—every sensory cue (mist tightening, brittle song) pressures Elian's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten via prism's reactions: warmth rejects "I have let you go," flaring rejects "You were not afraid," while "I need you still" earns the fracture. Cost is undeniable—hairline crack in prism/himself, frost evaporating her initials. Textural escalation perfectly aligns with Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prism mechanics, not statement: "truthful lies" reprice grief as absorbable/releaseable. Final image (window clearing, prism left on dashboard) resonates without moralizing—"proof offered to anyone willing to look" earns wisdom through frost patterns. Avoids sentimentality by grounding universals in dashboard plastic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in frost-braille reading and silicon resonance. Voice modulates impeccably under stress: "drip of dew paused mid-air" compresses diction without losing texture. Zero head-hopping; free indirect thought ("He believed grief...") stays anchored in Elian's mystic lens. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm (e.g., "He whispered the first lie..." vs. "Through frost veins he saw..."). High density: "frost-rimmed window of her abandoned car, the last place she had breathed" does triple duty. Final line resolves via image—"proof offered to anyone willing to look through frost"—with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief physics via "truthful lies" and frost-braille mechanics transforms memory tropes. Emotional truth in "fracture knit—not healed, but repositioned" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; removing quartz arbor would collapse the resonance.</comment>
