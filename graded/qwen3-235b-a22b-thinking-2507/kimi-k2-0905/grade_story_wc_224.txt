<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "substitutes reality nightly" versus stone's hum; embodied emotion in "thickness in her throat" avoids labels. Old man lacks pressure despite thematic resonance, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary" reconfigures stakes with visible cost (crumbling stone, cracked glass). Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bookstore bones and mercury glass constrain every choice—rearranging corridors embody her talent's return. Feather's "black as void/light as breath" charges final image while avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single stake (reclaiming talent without self-destruction) tightens through deepening: war trauma narrows options until feather forces irreversible choice. Cost crystallizes in stone's dust and skin's revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—burned house, feather writing—not abstraction. Final line reweights "belonging" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "after-images of readers," "copper-tasting air." Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax ("She lifted the feather...") sustains voice during climax without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "labyrinthine bookstore's stone wall" slightly dilutes momentum. Zero loops, but "feather lay waiting" passive construction in high-pressure beat costs 0.3 points pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookstore trope through "mercury-glass skin" and "language stone" mechanics. Risk-taking (accumulative tension over causal turns) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
