<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pilgrim's "perpetually surprised" trait remains a label without embodied contradiction or tradeoffs; Mara's micro-choices (descending stairs, pulling lever) earn closure but lack visible cost escalation in peak beats. Interiority avoids therapy-speak yet pilgrim reads archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (stars as waypoints) with conceptual cost of parents' absence reframed as frequency journey. Orientation anchored early but pilgrim's "I know you're there" lacks causal setup, weakening escalation from tracking to confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Broken astrolabe directly enables press scene; matrix chip's star-shadows charge the final image. But observatory functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—drone operation would work identically in any ruin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single stake (finding belonging via frequency) deepens meaningfully when chip reveals moving stars, but escalation plateaus after drone reveal. Cost is felt (parents' absence reframed) yet lacks visceral manifestation beyond conceptual realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Belonging as frequency" emerges through press mechanics without moralizing; final image reweights parents' disappearance as cosmic journey. Avoids thematic echo but "missing pieces" concept remains underdramatized until late.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's drone-pilot lexicon ("mechanical bird," "cameras focused") creates distinct perceptual signature. Pilgrim's dialogue lacks subtext ("prints belonging" feels archetypal), though rhythmic control under pressure (twilight to starlight transition) remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" repeated verbatim; "brilliant dimness" appears twice mechanically. No scaffold cadence but "eyes that held galaxies" edges toward cliché. Final line slightly overwrites with "frequency of belonging" abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frequency-based belonging transforms quest trope through printer mechanics and matrix chip specificity. Emotional truth in grandmother's dying words elevates it, but pilgrim archetype drags freshness down from inevitable synthesis.</comment>
