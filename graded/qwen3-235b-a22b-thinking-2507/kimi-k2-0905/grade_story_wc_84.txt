<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied motivation for Mara, but pilgrim remains underdeveloped; "perpetually surprised" trait lacks integration into choices. Final choice feels slightly unearned without visible struggle against flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost (parents' disappearance reweighted as following frequency). Orientation clear by para 1, drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density buildup to resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ancient observatory actively constrains choices (column for drone landing, broken astrolabe as focal point) and charges the final image ("brilliant dimness" twilight becoming waypoints). Sensory details filtered through drone-pilot precision and cosmic wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when pilgrim reveals parents "followed their frequency," but escalation lacks Mara's active testing of the concept. Cost is legible (redefined understanding of loss) yet agency feels passive during resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "missing pieces" concept; final image reweights stars as "waypoints" without moralizing. Near-miss on Q5 9+ gate: "frequency of belonging" risks thematic echo but saved by concrete printing mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (drone pilot's mechanical precision vs. cosmic wonder) with rhythmic control. Slight register drift in "galaxies that didn't align with any earthly sky" momentarily breaks POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("star-shadows across ancient stones"). Minor artifact: "trembled perpetually surprised" creates grammatical friction. Final line’s "frequency of belonging" avoids thematic echo through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of type foundry tech with cosmic belonging avoids tropes. "Printing frequencies" premise transformed through specific mechanics (hand press, matrix chip). Risks poetic abstraction but grounded by drone pilot’s occupational lens.</comment>
