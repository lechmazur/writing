<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara almost understands the letter's seduction but chooses truth; "heartbeat counting options" embodies micro-choice under pressure. Slight flaw: "emotionally rational" trait lacks sufficient stress-testing during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: her leap crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("ministers would curse her name"). Hybrid lens (accumulative/causal) holds through the rosebush parallel and final image reweighting Rowan's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy actively guides her search ("coiled like patient serpents"), the rosebush's petal drop times her mission, and the rusted rails charge the final image. Micro-setting constrains choice and fuels closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening when the letter's "seductive pull" forces Elara to confront her motivation. Cost escalates from academic risk to political fallout, made visceral by "ministers would curse her name" foreclosing safe scholarly paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "beauty of convenient stories" through the bare rosebush—a resonant, non-literal answer to truth's cost. Avoids moralizing; thematic complexity emerges from Elara's embodied choice, not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measure every shadow," "silver for her emotionally rational eyes") persists under pressure. Slight register drift in "pedestals her family once decorated" disrupts historian-in-action voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "orange nets across the ivy" compresses action/image without muddle. Minor deduction: "seductive pull of Rowan’s original intent" leans abstract in high-pressure beat, risking figurative dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical truth-seeking with railway decay; rosebush isn’t decorative but charges closure’s cost. Transformation test passed: swapping "rosebush" for generic "flower" would break the final parallel’s inevitability.</comment>
