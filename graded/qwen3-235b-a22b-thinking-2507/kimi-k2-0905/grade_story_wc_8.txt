<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seductive pull of the lie vs. truth's cost) act simultaneously in the tile-prying beat; childhood memory creates authentic friction that earns her final choice with visible shedding of "inherited false glory."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the bare rosebush and "petal-less air" crystallize the conceptual cost of truth-telling with undeniable pressure; accumulative lens holds from the first petal spiral to the dawn-lit rails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and rosebush constrain choices (guiding search, timing escape) and charge the final image; "bare rosebush duty done" reweights the setting’s role from backdrop to active participant in the shedding of false glory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the watchman’s torch forces flight—a live option foreclosed through her agency—reweighting the dominant conflict with the felt cost of "shedding inherited false glory" as she leaps the tracks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "country learning to distrust the beauty of convenient stories" reweights the premise without moralizing; the CR closure emerges from the rosebush’s bare branches and plain-paper chronicle, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("emotionally rational eyes measuring shadows," brass bands vs. rattling glass) creates rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from clinical precision to lyrical hope without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gold still arrogant, its azure virgin despite soot and damp" demonstrates high density with textural specificity that advances both atmosphere and thematic weight in a single stroke.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical revisionism through physical quest: "emotionally rational" trait avoids cliché while the rosebush timing device transforms a trope into organic pressure, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
