<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (speaking lullaby backward) and micro-moves; "honoring overlooked histories means returning what was taken" earns the fragment exchange with visceral cost ("exhaling a life"). No diagnostic labels—memory floods via tactile hands lifting shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "We keep the light by letting it go" crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("absence weighs more"). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation ("painting exhales too, sky cracking open"). Cost proof: "absence weighs more than presence" legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Alchemist’s market actively constrains choices (swaying bridges forcing vertigo override); lighthouse fragment as micro-setting charges final image ("absence weighs more"). Sensory hierarchy perfect: "taste of copper/salt" signals death, "pigment-warm dusk" embodies time travel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "translator’s instinct overriding vertigo" forces step-through, narrowing options to keep/release fragment. Cost unmistakable in "absence weighs more," reconfiguring light from object to shared burden. Single dominant stake (fragment’s ownership) deepens via "intuition is not a compass but a tide."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "overlooked histories are not collected but released" reweights prior collection via gulls "let out of paintings." Final line "We keep the light by letting it go" offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids false balance—painter’s death carries weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: "hidden details in paintings are my method" filters all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure ("I speak the lullaby backward; the fragment... glows") with taught elision ("memory floods—my small hands lifting it"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical to sparse in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "taste of copper and salt" evolves meaning across beats without redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies organically ("ropes creaking like ship masts" → "pockets empty yet resonant"). Figurative language ("gulls let out of paintings") clarifies stakes in peak beats. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes via "between-worlds translator" premise transformed by specific stakes (fragment as "shared bone"). Emotional truth in child/adult exchange avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence—"anchors of intuition" redefined as "tide" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
