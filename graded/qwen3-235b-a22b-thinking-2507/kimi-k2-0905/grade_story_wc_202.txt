<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when adult-self realizes returning the fragment means ending their translator role ("translator no longer"), but child-me’s reaction lacks layered conflict beyond wide eyes; micro-choice of handing back the shard earns the renunciation with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "We keep the light by letting it go" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the fragment’s absence "weighs more than its presence," and the market folds into fog, making the exchange feel like "exhaling a life."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the climax when adult-self unfastens their satchel cord; its absence later charges the final image as children chase refracted light "through absent glass," tethering ghosts to living skin via tangible absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through one tightening: the adult’s decision to return the fragment forecloses their translator identity ("pockets empty yet resonant"), with felt cost in the market’s dissolution and the weight of absence; agency drives the renunciation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lens fragment’s journey—keeping light requires release—avoiding moralizing; the final image of children painting "traveling constellations" with refracted light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of honoring overlooked histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ropes creaking like ship masts" and "taste of copper and salt"; rhythmic control under pressure peaks when the catwalk becomes the cliff ("Memory floods—my small hands..."), compressing time without losing clarity or voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "I speak the lullaby backward; the fragment... glows, elusively tangible, a shared bone across time," where rhythm accelerates to mirror the reversal; "elusively tangible" recurs with purpose, charging closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "returning lost objects" trope through the lens fragment’s emotional specificity—the child pockets it because it "hums like my mother’s voice"—making the synthesis of light/memory/tide feel inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the lyric structure paying off at closure.</comment>
