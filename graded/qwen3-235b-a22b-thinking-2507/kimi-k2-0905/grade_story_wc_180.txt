<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("accidental wisdom") over embodied contradiction; micro-choices like ribbon-pendulum use reveal values, but "endearingly feisty" remains performative rather than shaping action with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (rotted ribbon’s fragrance as covenant), but elders’ amended contracts arrive coincidentally, not through mender’s agency, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices (grafting on rafters, roots coiled around corbels) and charges the final coconut-copper scent; sensory details like "plaster saints crunching" anchor urgency while avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (orchard survival vs. city betrayal) tighten through mender’s grafting agency, but elders’ return introduces external resolution rather than deepening pressure from her actions, missing the "visible price altering tactics" band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "deciduous vows" composting into roots, but final paragraph’s "accidental wisdom had outgrown its own apology" states the thesis directly, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("boots crunching on plaster saints," "time persisting like sap") with rhythmic control; purposeful compression (e.g., "driven by deciduous vows") taught early and paid off in closure’s lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("roots coiled around corbels, and the mender knew...") with concrete propulsion, but "deciduous vows" repetition edges toward synonym churn in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mending ecology with bureaucratic betrayal avoids tropes; "quartz-eye" specificity transforms generational wisdom into tangible grafting stakes, though "feisty" trait risks middle-ground hedging without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
