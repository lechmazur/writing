<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstractly philosophical ("born without future/past") without concrete embodiment of contradiction; micro-choices lack visceral stakes despite strong conceptual foundation. Final renunciation earns cost but feels detached from human struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "letting go in the right order" tattoo reconfigures continuity with conceptual cost as she becomes the path. Accumulative lens holds through dream-bird escalation to storm transcendence without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker actively constrains choices (lens-roof flooding, corridor melodies) and charges final image as "seed cracking open." Recurring wafer seal and storm transform setting from obstacle to collaborator with tangible pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through interpreted dreams ("hunger sees her back") but remain intellectual; agency-driven escalation peaks when chlorophyll rewrites directive into lullaby, narrowing options to transcendence with felt cost of identity dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("walkers and paths are one another’s becoming") reweights the central question without moralizing; "decay is freedom remembering its first shape" earns resonance through dream-bird and storm mechanics rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metal sweat under green fingers," "crystal and rust" laugh) sustains under pressure; "precisely playful" architecture teaches pattern early, enabling legible elision in dream sequences without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chlorophyll bleeds into circuits" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("paper bird" dreams) intensifies pressure without muddle, even as wafer seal melts into skin during climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of path/walker ontology through concrete mechanics (wafer seal, storm); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids abstraction via "ethereal grit" specificity like "iron and apple" syllables.</comment>
