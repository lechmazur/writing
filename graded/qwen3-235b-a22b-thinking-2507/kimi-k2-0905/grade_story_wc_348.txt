<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (scientist vs. grieving sister) embodied through polymer metaphors; refusal of final call motivates atonement choice with visible cost ("loosened grief slipping down cheeks"). No stock phrasing; micro-choices like chrysalis handling reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara walking away while sculptures pulse embodies earned renunciation with cost ("pockets empty, knowing river would keep touching people"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increase in final paragraph reweights separation as "temporary braid" with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains every choice (ash scattering, resin insight, sculpture placement) and charges closure ("ravine had become an instrument"). River foam patterns directly enable the polymer lattice solution; micro-setting (chrysalis) is indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming separation into connection) signaled by paragraph 1; single deepening (river foam insight) narrows options to resin solution with felt cost (trembling knees, tears). Pressure tightens through Mara’s agency—no coincidence resolves grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "polymers of memory rewoven into bridges stronger than original loss" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("separation is only a temporary braid") offers resonant answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chemist’s precision ("440 hertz, concert pitch") blends with lyrical grief ("fossilized moonlight"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during insight ("An insight surfaced..."), flowing cadence at closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates organically from clinical to vulnerable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("water slapping rock, cicadas rising and falling—symphonically minded" compresses setting, sound, character trait). Final line achieves crystalline resonance without muddle. One borderline academic phrase ("symphonically minded") barely avoids register drift penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through polymer science specificity—"foam-templated resin" and "micro-actuator" feel lived-in, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (scientific precision in lyrical context) heightens emotional stakes; "river foam patterns" reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
