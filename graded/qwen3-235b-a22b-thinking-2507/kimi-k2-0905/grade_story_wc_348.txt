<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s scientific precision versus emotional unraveling; embodied grief in "knees trembling, loosened grief slipping down her cheeks" avoids cliché. Micro-choice to cast the chrysalis as mold earns closure through causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: sculptures singing transform absence into connection, reconfiguring grief’s stakes. Accumulative lens holds tightly; river braiding pattern pays off in the symphonic crescendo’s felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Braided ravine micro-setting constrains choice—Mara traces river foam to solve her polymer problem—and charges closure as the singing sculptures turn the ravine into an "instrument." Final image of pulsed sculptures reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating separation into connection) escalates through Mara’s agency: insight → resin synthesis → embedding audio. Cost is palpable in trembling knees and the final "loosened grief," narrowing options to transformative action under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: sculptures singing laughter/resonance answer the central question without moralizing. Final image—"polymers of memory rewoven into bridges"—reweights loss as connection, avoiding sentimentality through scientific specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("river foam patterns that braided, split, and re-braided like polymer chains") reflects chemist’s mind. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no POV slippage. Slight register drift in "symphonically minded" barely tempers 9.5 potential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("stirring until the mixture sang at 440 hertz") propels momentum. "Fossilized moonlight" avoids figurative muddle. Near-flawless rhythm, though "loosened grief slipping down her cheeks like chalky runoff" edges toward mixed metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Brilliant synthesis: polymer science transforms grief processing beyond trope. Chrysalis-to-resonant-sculpture concept feels inevitable yet fresh; specificity ("micro-actuator vibrating at human heat") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
