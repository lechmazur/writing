<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's embodied emotion ("wound tasted like metal") and micro-choices under pressure (burying drive) earn high marks, but Elias lacks contradictory impulses; his motivation feels symbolic rather than character-driven despite clean focalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: burying the USB with pendant-shadow promise reconfigures stakes with visible cost ("world has taken its cut"), and accumulative lens holds through drip-pattern payoff without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss garden actively constrains choices (spores clinging, earth-packing) and charges the final image; micro-setting (amber pendant) dictates burial tactics and embodies the "small things survive" resolution, exceeding 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative lens succeeds—drip pattern deepens the viral trauma stake as Mira shifts from confession to patient seed-planting—but Elias' arrival slightly softens the pressure, lacking one more meaningful tightening beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: ant's shadow reweights "patience" without moralizing, and "circuits gone quiet enough to hear roots" offers non-literal resolution to trauma/silence, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("collected discarded silences like seeds needing darkness") controls rhythmic compression under pressure; no head-hopping, and lyric elision (Elias' backstory) is taught early through "dripping cadence" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances multiple elements ("spores clung to her skin" embodies emotion/setting/action), though "trembling, unedited" slightly strains freshness in peak-beat without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech-trauma tropes via moss/data center; emotional specificity ("graft new meaning onto wounds") avoids templates, and risk-taking (quiet resistance to virality) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
