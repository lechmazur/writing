<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wound tasted like metal" vs. planting seeds) and embodied micro-choices (holding pendant to camera) earn the final renunciation; Elias' thinness forgiven at 700 words as pressure-coherent secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: burial forecloses viral consumption with visible cost ("throat tightened, but stayed vulnerably protected"); drip-pattern motif shapes the earth-packing action while lens (Accumulative) holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss garden constrains choice (burial site), with icicles' drip pattern charging the final image; "emerald carpets swallowed the hum" integrates setting into emotional stakes without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (trauma transformation vs. viral consumption) tighten through Mira's agency—recording "the next sentence the world had not yet earned" forecloses dissemination path with felt cost in her vulnerability during playback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ant's patience reweights collapse without moralizing; final shadow projection offers resonant answer to "what grows inside wounds" while avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("collected discarded silences like seeds needing darkness") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "dripped a slow Morse against the steel" avoids lyric overwriting while teaching compression early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "graft new meaning before rust spread to her tongue" achieves triple duty (character/backstory/theme) with precise metaphor; final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech decay (data center) as healing space avoids trauma tropes; risk-taking in quiet closure ("tiny circuit blinked... dreaming of voices") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
