<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince’s motivation ("raw as broken crown") and contradictory impulses (grave-robbing feather yet whispering apologies) drive choices with embodied cost. Final renunciation of beauty’s permanence ("shy of cages") earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: palace descent reconfigures "flawed genesis" with conceptual cost ("fall itself might be first spread of wings"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, cost legible in rust-to-gold transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended palace constrains choice (chains snapping during descent) and charges final image; "corroded cradle" motif evolves from description to active pressure. Micro-setting (egg warming) directly charges closure’s genesis moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative pressure: each "hypothesizing" attempt deepens sensory density, narrowing options toward inevitable cost ("palace quake"). Prince’s agency in assembling the heart drives the deepening; beauty’s ephemerality becomes the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "flawed genesis is still genesis" – the final image reweights rust/beauty without moralizing. Egg’s cracking as "first word ever spoken" offers resonant answer to reawakening beauty, avoiding thematic echo via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sky punched-in," "rust wept gears") reflects prince’s decayed worldview. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("cradle designed to tremble at frequency of forgiveness"); elision (off-screen raven theft) taught early and paid off in feather’s graphite memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops except "bitterly sweet" used twice as label (not embodied) in peak beats – minor figurative muddle prevents 9.0. Otherwise, propulsion flawless: "ribbon of colored wind" crystallizes sensory density without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms mechanical-fantasy tropes through specific logic (spider-silk rope, postal automaton demanding oil). Fresh synthesis: beauty’s return as "unscrewing gears" feels inevitable yet revelatory; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
