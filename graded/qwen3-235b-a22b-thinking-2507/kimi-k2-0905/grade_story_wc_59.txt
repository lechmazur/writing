<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (distilling moonlight, grave-robbing raven feather) revealing contradictory impulses; closure choice (accepting the fall) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Single-POV limitation prevents relationship dynamics scoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (palace collapse = "first spread of wings"); orientation anchors instantly ("bedraggled prince hung upside-down"). Hairline slip: gear-unscrewing mechanism slightly abstract under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices (working upside-down) and charges final image (chains snapping); "cradle of soft leaves" crown unknitting proves environment shapes closure. Micro-setting (egg, copper shavings) drives all key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reawakening beauty) tightens through protagonist's escalating agency (moonlight distillation → pin rearrangement); cost (palace descent) is visceral and irreversible. Pressure coheres perfectly under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars ("rust flaked away revealing forgotten blues"); ending reweights "flawed genesis" as hopeful without moralizing. Final image ("child would hear colored wind") resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky looked punched-in," "bitterly sweet note of nostalgia") with rhythmic control; minor overwriting in music-box section ("Morse of his own sobbing") slightly disrupts pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "bitterly sweet" repetition and near-synonym churn in moonlight section ("quivering spectrum," "trembling reverie") create subtle scaffold. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical decay and rebirth through specific, grounded choices ("egg warm as though flawed genesis still believed in calendars"); risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
