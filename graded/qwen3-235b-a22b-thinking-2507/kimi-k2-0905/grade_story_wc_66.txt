<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mila's embodied contradiction—copying silence while smuggling stories—drives every micro-choice, culminating in her quiet endurance as inspectors shed ash like turning pages. Final renunciation (not fleeing) forecloses escape with visceral cost: her entire existence reconfigured into dust-narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: inspectors' uniforms shedding ash while mouthing burned words crystallizes the story's rebirth. Accumulative lens holds—each broadcast phrase deepens the encoding method until solstice's vibrating dust chord reweights the famine's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove's green phosphor glow directly constrains Mila's transcription work, while rosin-inked parchment drying into "translucent scales" becomes the literal vehicle for the climax. Final image ties alcove's cooling to the dial's "tiny green planet," charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—smuggling stories via musical intervals—tightens through the broadcaster's escalating phrases ("embers plot their escape") and solstice deadline. Mila's agency (weaving copper antennae) forces irreversible cost: inspectors inhaling the chord, their eyes reflecting burned paragraphs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "powdered rosin scraped from forgotten cellos" embodies art's persistence. Final image—"dust continuing whispering"—resonantly answers "can stories survive suppression?" without moralizing, reweighting the famine through inspectors' ash-shedding uniforms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musical metaphors ("melody bent like light through stained glass") and tactile urgency ("mist tasting of iron") modulate with pressure. Rhythmic control peaks at climax—"dust retelling the famine"—where short clauses vibrate with the chord's physicality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances density ("pencil hovering" conveys hesitation and hope). "Powdered rosin scraped from forgotten cellos" exemplifies triple-duty prose (action, setting, theme). Minor register drift: "thistled calm" slightly abstract for high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via specific synthesis: story famine as banned librettos, rebellion through tritones for rebellion. Risk-taking (weaving antennae from music stands) heightens stakes organically—the dust-telling-stories premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
