<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marrow’s contradictory impulses—truth-weaving caution vs. emotional vulnerability—culminate in earned change (unguarded smile) with visible cost. Interiority shines via embodied micro-choices like pressing palms to ice, though minor depth lacking in her shrine endurance struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ice mirror reweights "windows of connection" with undeniable conceptual cost (ephemeral understanding). Accumulative lens holds via dream-shrine density buildup; glacier’s "silence" answer slightly convenient but doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier ice constrains choices (skin sticking to walls, thermal bag necessity) and charges closure through the mirror’s reclamation of "light in wreckage." Micro-setting mastery: snow globe evolves from dream artifact to final mirror, directly shaping the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake escalation driven purely by Marrow’s agency—analyzing cameos, entering shrine, following jellyfish memories—with cost crystallized in her "first unguarded expression." Pressure tightens via her tactile choices under ice, though the glacier’s demands could feel more actively antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "wreckage cradling light" crystallized in the snow globe/mirror without moralizing. Final image reweights "windows of connection" as tapestry threads, offering resonant non-literal answer to salvaging purity through collective sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: diver’s tactile focus ("palms against ice walls") modulates from clinical to lyrical under pressure. Zero filter verbs; rhythm shifts perfectly (short "Marrow understood the rules" vs. flowing "glass flowing like syrup") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels with textural precision ("crevasse-blue ice," "meltwater reflecting future"). Final line recharges "windows" motif flawlessly. Minor slip: "hymn that tasted like salt" slightly abstract but forgivable in context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wreck-diving meets dream logic transforms tropes (snow globe → evolving mirror, "pigeons that were never birds"). Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes coherently; "cameo faces" specificity avoids abstraction, making emotional truth inevitable.</comment>
