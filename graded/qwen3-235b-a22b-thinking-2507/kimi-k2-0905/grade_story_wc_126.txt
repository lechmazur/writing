<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (tradition vs innovation) act simultaneously as she plants the seed against family custom while honoring her grandmother's legacy; the final choice to play unfinished phrases is earned by the seedling's growth, with visible cost in the transformed "chronic hush" that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the seedling's leaf unfurls against copper light, reconfiguring "beauty in the unfinished" as invitation with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward this crystallized moment where silence becomes active space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse's soot-streaked glass constrains Mara's music by flinging back softened echoes that teach "how to let go," directly shaping her tactic of playing unfinished phrases; this micro-setting charges the final image where the structure "kept breathing unfinished music" as the new family tradition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency as her deliberate harmonic wobble provokes the orchard's exhalation and shipwreck's bell response, narrowing options until the tremor reveals the seed's root reaching toward "drowned stories," with cost legible in the persistent hush she transforms through refusal to complete phrases.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The final image of "a note that refuses to end so something else can begin" offers a resonant answer to whether beauty can exist in ruin, reweighting the scorched seed and empty bowl through concrete action without moralizing; thematic complexity emerges from Mara's realization that incompleteness invites rather than abandons.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines as acoustically precise descriptions ("drip... as minor seventh begging resolution") modulate with emotional intensity; rhythmic control shifts from contemplative long sentences to stark fragments like "She played until dawn," with all elision taught through sensory anchors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character (e.g., "ash-slick mud of the sunken orchard greenhouse" establishes setting and emotional texture); the final line recharges "unfinished music" with crystalline precision without figurative muddle in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic ruin and acoustic sensitivity transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices (mendicant's bowl as resonator); risk-taking in quiet closure deepens stakes by making the "vast, simple magnificence" of persistent uncertainty feel inevitable.</comment>
