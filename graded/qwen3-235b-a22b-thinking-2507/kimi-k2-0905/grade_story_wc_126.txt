<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (beauty in the unfinished) drives every micro-choice, from wobbly notes to wire resonator, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously: honoring grandmother's legacy while rejecting bonfire tradition. Her embodied emotion—palms on soil feeling the seed's tremor—avoids labels and crystallizes in the earned renunciation of completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the seedling's "green as a new question" reconfigures tradition with undeniable conceptual cost ("a note that refuses to end so something else can begin"). Orientation anchors in line 1, Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (sound fragments → seedling unfurling), and cost proof lands in the final image without retroactive explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as active micro-setting: its glass "teaches her how to let go" by flinging back flattened echoes, directly constraining Mara's playing tactics. Shipwrecks aren't backdrop—they "listen" via clinking bell—culminating in the final image where the structure "breathes unfinished music," charging closure through environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is pure Accumulative/Textural: each unresolved musical fragment deepens the "chronic hush" until the seedling's growth forces a reconfiguration. Mara's agency drives every intensification (twisting rigging wire into resonator), with the cost—abandoning bonfire tradition for "vast, simple magnificence"—made visceral through the bowl's transformation from empty to humming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the "unfinished" seed/notes become "invitation," avoiding moralizing. The final image ("a note that refuses to end") reweights tradition non-literally, with grandmother's fire lesson ("What feeds you must survive the fire") reframed through the bowl's cool earth—earned wisdom rooted in action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "drip of condensation... minor seventh begging resolution" filters world through violinist's acuity. Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical for atmosphere, staccato for action ("She knelt... pressed... planted")—with no head-hopping. Prose texture mirrors musical phrasing, compressing time without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soot-streaked but intact" does triple duty (setting/metaphor/theme). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting: "green as a new question against the copper light" achieves textural specificity. No figurative muddle—every image (hair-thin root, frayed rigging wire) charges momentum toward the seedling's unfurling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "artist reviving tradition" through acoustic constraints and shipwreck setting. The "unfinished" concept isn't thematic gloss—it drives tactics (deliberate wobble notes) and closure. Risk-taking (silence as climax) heightens stakes: removing the greenhouse's echo effect would collapse the story's logic, proving organic synthesis.</comment>
