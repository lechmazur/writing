<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("steadily curious hunger") and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; the cartomancer's endurance feels earned yet her internal conflict remains subtly abstract despite vivid actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in "infinite regression of exits" image; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, though the cost—while legible—could feel more visceral at the decisive beat where the debt sigil is marked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight actively constrains choices (dripping sounds affecting timing, mist fogging glass) and charges the final image; measuring tape functions as micro-setting that evolves from tool to "secular relic," directly shaping the closure's cartographic revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping cultural patterns before forgetting) tightens meaningfully when the leveraged debt sigil recurs, but escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist agency; cost is conceptual yet slightly detached from embodied consequence in the peak discovery moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cartomancy-as-archaeology metaphor; the final image ("pattern captured centimeter by centimeter") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to documenting collapse without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("droplet... coin falling into empty wallet") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity (e.g., thunder pauses tightening syntax), with all elision taught early and paid off in the fractal discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or stakes with surgical precision ("measuring tape scarred with bite marks" does triple duty); no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the debt sigil revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes crypto collapse with cartomancy into a fresh, non-obvious frame; risk-taking (geometry as prophecy tool) heightens stakes coherently, though the "inherited mystery" trope slightly tempers the boldness without undermining integrity.</comment>
