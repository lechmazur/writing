<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking meaning in erasure) embodied via chalk-dust tongue and micro-choices (sprinkling flake dust); final scattering earned by mandala's refusal of eternity. "Socially perceptive" trait slightly told vs. shown in congregation realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with conceptual cost: "erasure was the final, necessary stroke" crystallizes impermanence under Accumulative lens. Hush thickening and tile vibration drive escalation, but "ripened into acceptance" slightly abstracts cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering grotto constrains choice (kneeling in quartz circle) and charges closure via "pearl" mist; tile flake as micro-setting directly enables mandala's exhalation. "Rain on hot brick" scent ties environment to emotional shift without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (meaning in erasure) signaled via erased plaza stones; escalation through deepening hush and vibrating tile narrows options to scattering. Agency-driven, but "lilac unease ripened" slightly softens visceral cost of renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: erasure as necessary stroke, scattering as seeding. Final whisper "mess is only place unfinished enough to welcome you" reweights premise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("lilac unease drifted like watercolor") and rhythmic control peak in "mandala exhaled; the ground itself sighed." No head-hopping; compression under stress ("She answered by sweeping one spiral") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "porcelain face carried faint echo" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language precise in peak beats ("mist folded inward until she stood inside a pearl"); no muddle despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-listening via sand mandala; "emergent hush" transforms cliché through concrete grotto pressure. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with closure image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
