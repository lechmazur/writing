<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Mira both seeks meaning and fears articulation ("afraid to say aloud"), culminating in her sweeping spiral into straight path—a micro-choice that embodies refusal of permanence. Final renunciation of fixed meaning is earned through visceral progression from "chalk dust on tongue" to "motion to repeat," avoiding over-articulated insight via embodied cost (salt/lilac taste).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "erasure was the final, necessary stroke" crystallizes impermanence’s conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Lens holds as Accumulative—density builds via hush thickening and tile vibrations—yet minimal escalation (single deepening from fragmented whispers to coherent truth) prevents 9.5+. Orientation clear by line 1; cost proof evident in plaza’s "already forgetting" stones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Whispering grotto micro-setting constrains every choice: damp stone enables listening, wet ground shapes mandala, mist folding creates the "pearl" space. Recurring tile flake charges closure as it "crumbled into porcelain snow," proving 9+ gate eligibility. Sensory hierarchy masterful—"lilac unease" evolves from visual tint to skin-feel, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in impermanence) signaled immediately via "chalk dust on tongue" and tightened through Mira’s agency: sprinkling tile dust triggers hush’s reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable—"erasure was the final, necessary stroke" alters tactics as she scatters the mandala. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening, though external conflict remains purely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the mandala’s fate: "each disappearance seeded another grotto" reweights impermanence as generative. Final image ("plaza stones gleamed, already forgetting") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Coherent subtext in gestures—sweeping spiral straight embodies rejection of eternity—avoiding thematic echo despite profound insight ("mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through artist’s lens: grains as "syllables," mist "tinting air like watercolor." Rhythmic control peaks under pressure ("She answered by sweeping one spiral into a sudden straight path"—short, decisive syntax). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates seamlessly from lyrical ("lilac unease") to sparse ("She laughed silently") as tension rises, teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; every line multi-tasks ("socially perceptive enough to notice... insects withheld songs" establishes trait + setting + stakes). "Porcelain snow" slightly strains metaphor (snow implies cold/soft, porcelain hard), but context ("melted on wet stone") resolves tension. Propulsion flawless: "ground itself sighed" merges action/image, avoiding purple prose even at peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms impermanence trope via "unlearning" mist and whispering tiles—fresh synthesis where erasure ("final, necessary stroke") seeds renewal. Bold risk: making silence a "congregation" of absences feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids abstraction; "lilac unease" as tangible tone elevates beyond generic melancholy. No derivative echoes; every detail serves Mira’s artistic struggle.</comment>
