<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs embodied knowing) crystallizes credibly during convergence, but "luminous" feels stock; micro-choice of tasting ring lacks earlier pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—ring branding crystallizes cost of skepticism’s collapse—but forest election subplot dilutes pressure during pivotal convergence beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender bluff constrains choice (eastern slope descent), aurora’s taste charges final image; "ozone and lavender" sensory specificity evolves into seed’s all-season taste with earned cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (skepticism vs acceptance) tighten meaningfully at convergence, but forest election detour weakens causal pressure; cost of melted resistance feels earned though.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through taste/weather metaphors until final paragraph’s thematic echo ("storms meant to be shared") triggers -0.7 penalty for didactic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (taste-based weather sensing) remains consistent; rhythmic control under pressure peaks during convergence cyclone; no head-hopping in Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts, but "futuristic nostalgia" repetition creates minor synonym churn; high density maintained except in forest election digression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-bearers as atmospheric phenomena avoids cliché, though "terrestrially cosmic" risks derivative phrasing; emotional truth anchors innovation.</comment>
