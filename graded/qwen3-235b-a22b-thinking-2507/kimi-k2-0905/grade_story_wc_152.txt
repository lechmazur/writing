<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (wisdom/foolishness) drive every choice; the final renunciation of bloodshed via embroidered truth earns cost through prior causality in the reversed song and comet vectors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the lieutenant’s trembling pistol lowering crystallizes the cost of fractured republics versus embroidered futures, with "thread fibers crackling" making conceptual cost undeniable under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory constrains every choice—from dome shade to projector glass—while the eternal candle’s flame charges the final image; tool (needle) and environment actively reshape tactics during the map’s ignition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as the embroidered map’s hidden layer forces conspirators’ stance crystallization; cost is unmistakable in the lieutenant’s lowered pistol and erased dawn speeches, scaling perfectly to short form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "adjacent possibilities" as the final image ("unheard stories waiting between one thread") reweights the central question without moralizing, embracing complexity via embroidered futures the plotters never conceived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stitching Andromeda’s spiral arms while autumn wind rattled") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in the reversed song and "echoed silence" sequences teaches pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "flame from eternal candle" repetitions dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats; otherwise flawless propulsion with zero scaffold, though the redundancy prevents 9.0 despite masterful density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as tactical espionage transforms tropes; "adjacent possibilities" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet bold, with specificity ("comets as supply vectors") anchoring universals without abstraction.</comment>
