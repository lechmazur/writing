<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embroiderer’s contradictory impulses (senile act vs. strategic humming) drive credible choices; micro-choices like thread-cutting reveal hierarchy of values. Astronomers lack pressure depth despite clear choreography. Cost in conspirators’ shattered certainty lands but secondary characters don’t compound stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: conspirators’ worldview fractures when pistol lowers. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (embroidery layers → projected confession). Minor flaw: "adjacent possibilities" method isn’t fully dramatized in middle beats, slightly weakening causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt dome constrains choice (silk color matching enables deception) and charges final image ("ordinary chill of autumn" contrasting conspiracy’s heat). Observatory’s projector glass plate directly alters tactics during climax. Micro-setting (embroidery frame) functions as essential environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when map spreads on projector—single decisive escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in lieutenant’s trembling hand and conceptual in erased coup. But stakes remain slightly abstract (republic’s fate vs. personal survival), diluting emotional urgency at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embroidered "unheard stories" reweighted in final line ("sky still unfinished"). No moralizing; closure’s "seeds of futures" offers non-literal answer to resistance. Avoids thematic echo by making embroidery the sole vehicle for wisdom—no abstract assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: thread tensions and light refractions shape noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure ("hummed a children’s nonsense song whose syllables reversed") modulates intensity. Zero head-hopping; single POV maintained through embodied craft metaphors even during confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crackling thread fibers" crystallizes tension. Minor deduction: "flame from eternal candle" verbatim repetition muddies rhythm in high-pressure beats. Otherwise, unparalleled density—every phrase advances atmosphere ("stained-glass panes rattled") or causality ("folded cloth into careless wad").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms espionage tropes through embroidery-as-intelligence. Emotional truth in disguised wisdom avoiding safety hedging (blood kept off linen via lullabies). Fresh synthesis: coup foiled through textile physics rather than violence. Risks lyrical compression without obscuring stakes.</comment>
