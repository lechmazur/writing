<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("find where stories live") told not conflicted; no contradictory impulses or tradeoffs under pressure. "Sanely eccentric" trait remains label-only without constraining actions or revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong conceptual repricing closure as scarf's warmth fades while patrons grasp inspiration, reweighting "where stories live" with conceptual cost. Minor cost ambiguity: scarf's quieting lacks visceral legibility despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic library functions as active constraint: shelves bending at 179°/181° angles directly enable the journey. Micro-setting (scarf's warmth) charges the final image of dormant narratives bound into glowing threads.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: quest remains abstract with no narrowing options or tangible cost. Stakes ("find where stories live") never face concrete test—she succeeds effortlessly through passive observation without tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "hyperbolic folds between experience and expression" crystallizes as non-literal answer to central question. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights quest as stories living "everywhere and nowhere" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tactile sensations: weight of alien suns") and rhythmic control ("spines that bent through impossible angles"). Minor POV drift when poet's scribbling is observed without focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with lines like "narrative arcs folded into Möbius strips of cause and effect." Final line recharges "threshold" motif with earned resonance, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian as topology midwife transforms tropes through concrete mechanics (e.g., "topological pressure that forced authors to write"). Avoids abstraction with specific 17-year graveyard shift and 3:17 a.m. details.</comment>
