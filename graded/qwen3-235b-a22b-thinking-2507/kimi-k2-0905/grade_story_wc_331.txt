<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (scarf tugging as "past reawakening"), contradictory impulses act in scene (clinging to scarf vs. releasing it), and the final renunciation of the scarf is earned through prior causality with visible cost ("releasing every overdue hour"). Slight abstraction risk in "resonance between observer and observed" but saved by immediate tactile action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where hyperbolic geometry relaxes into Euclidean calm after scarf release, with unmistakable conceptual cost ("every overdue hour she had ever forgiven"). Orientation is clear by 50 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (e.g., books rearranging titles into questions).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tattered scarf functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tearing it releases cost) and charges the final image ("invisible filament," "silk brushed their wrist"). Library details like "thermodynamic elegies" pressure tactics by guiding her path and hiding the envelope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: entering the warped corridor tightens options through density increase (shorter steps covering more distance, titles rearranging), with cost unmistakable in the scarf's release of "overdue hours" and marginal notes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—stories as "resonance between observer and observed"—avoiding moralizing via the final tactile image ("tactile whisper that stories endure"). No thematic echo; the "origin of kindness" footnote reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("analog memories waking up," "saddle curves") with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "each step shorter than the last yet covering more distance"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("foxed leaf held a waveform of human curiosity" does triple duty). Figurative language remains coherent in peak beats (scarf's "plankton" glow), and final line crystallizes theme without abstraction ("guard the space where they breathe").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms librarian trope via scientific poetry specifics ("QC 24.5 .S6," "nautilus logarithms"). Risk-taking (hyperbolic geometry) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in "guarding other people’s epiphanies" avoids generic templates.</comment>
