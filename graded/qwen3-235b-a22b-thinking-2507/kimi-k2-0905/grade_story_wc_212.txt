<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure; actions are coherent but internal conflict remains linear rather than layered. Micro-choices like scattering seeds reveal values, yet the "furiously tranquil" trait isn't tested against competing drives at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "her role was to remain" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost ("velvet over iron" texture). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density shifts from fractured starlight to river-like fire, narrowing options through entropy decrease.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: ice retreat enables seed swelling, cold fuels roots. Final image ("dome glimmered like a snow-covered heart") charges closure by transforming earlier fragility into enduring rhythm, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: scattering seeds and exhaling warmth directly alter entropy mechanics, narrowing options to "decreasing entropy by surrendering heat." Cost is unmistakable—"role was to remain" as archivist—under accumulative lens where each seed placement reweights inheritance debt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "pay by planting what you cannot bear to lose" avoids moralizing by rooting debt in seed-pressing. Final image reweights vortex as "doorway" not storm, offering non-literal answer to inheritance via sapling's growth toward stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "breath freezing mid-exhale" and "velvet over iron" filter physics through seed-saver's tactile expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Ice retreated; seeds swelled") avoids uniformity, with elision ("She knelt, scattering...") taught early and paid in closure's heartbeat cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor density risk in high-pressure beats: "furiously tranquil hunger" stacks abstract modifiers without immediate payoff. Final image ("beating once per century") avoids muddle, yet opening's "promise breaking" metaphor slightly strains physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms seed-saving tropes through specific stakes: squirrel-toothed acorn cap and "entropy decrease" mechanics ground cosmic inheritance in agricultural intimacy. Risk-taking heightens coherence—lyric structure mirrors "borrowed time" texture without obscuring closure's cost.</comment>
