<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing through concrete micro-choices (breathing names into cap), but the grandmother’s ledger backstory flattens internal conflict into near-monolithic purpose, lacking contradictory impulses at pivotal moments like the vortex choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: splitting the vortex into seeds/heartbeat reconfigures time’s collapse with felt cost ("glaciers grinding cities into glitter"), though the "circulation" choice lacks sufficient causal groundwork in prior escalation beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (frost-rimmed walkway navigation) and charges the final image ("bark that felt like pages"), with sensory details filtered through gardener’s tactile expertise ("silk soaked in dawn").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens through sensory density (reversing fountain droplets, orbiting seeds), but the dominant stake—reopening linear time—lacks a visible price paid *during* the vortex confrontation, weakening cost legibility at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action ("fold itself into seed coats") and the acorn cap’s transformation, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "borrowed time" as both burden and generative force without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in gardener’s tactile lexicon ("texture of borrowed time," "bark like pages"), though the vortex inheritance’s cosmic scale strains POV plausibility during high-pressure beats like the seed orbit sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop in frost imagery ("frost feathered... frost retreated") dulls momentum in a high-pressure beat; otherwise, rhythmic control ("silk tearing and mending") and zero scaffolding achieve exceptional density under tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological stewardship and cosmic physics feels inevitable through character-specific details (oak cap’s sap), though "vortex inheritance" leans slightly on genre convention without sufficient transformation until the split-bead climax.</comment>
