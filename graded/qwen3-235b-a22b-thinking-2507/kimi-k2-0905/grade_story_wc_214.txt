<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "chest open, exposing the soft meteor of grief" – grief and cosmic curiosity act simultaneously. Final choice to leave lantern earned through whispered apologies and vision, with visible cost in traded glow. No diagnostic labels mar peak beats like the meteor's question.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: arranging mirrors as "welcoming committee" crystallizes vulnerability’s necessity with felt cost in "traded its glow for the softer lamp of reopened chest." Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchored by "cracked yellow lantern" within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice – tracing stars, embedding charcoal fleck, final transparency. Charges closure through "faint yellow afterimage shaped like a heart," making environment indispensable to the final image’s thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (is vulnerability strength?) tightens accumulatively through nightly empathizing until Perseids climax. Cost is unmistakable in "strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere," with protagonist agency driving every beat toward the mirror arrangement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from concrete action: meteor’s question about "being small enough to burn" reframes vulnerability as atmosphere. Final image of "heart that had learned to beat in open space" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies" and rhythm shifts perfectly under pressure – short staccato during vision ("He saw the meteor’s birth..."), lyrical flow in stillness. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style maintains consistent cosmic awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "brass instruments... tracked trajectories no human eye would ever again record" compresses setting/backstory/stakes in one line. Final phrase "hush of an era that learned strength in vulnerability" avoids cliché through concrete verbs and precise rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</comment><question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "janitor with wisdom" trope through cosmic mechanics – lantern hoarding star memories. Emotional truth in "grief for the planet that had forgotten how to look up" avoids sentimentality via specific, verifiable detail like charcoal fleck’s warmth.</comment>
