<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("soft meteor of grief," "chest open") with embodied emotion; contradictory impulses (duty vs. cosmic curiosity) drive micro-choices like nightly kneeling. Flaw: "spiritually curious" briefly risks label-only phrasing before action validates it, costing 0.1.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the transparent lantern and open dome crystallize vulnerability as "atmosphere," with cost legible in the vanished charcoal fleck's warmth. Orientation anchors within 100 words; accumulative lens taught through star-gazing repetitions pays off in the final heart afterimage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (yellow lantern glass) constrains every choice—from hoarding star memories to enabling the vision—and charges closure via the heart afterimage. Dust motes as "miniature galaxies" and brass instruments tracking "unrecorded trajectories" show selective POV bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: his empathy ("apologies for litter") directly causes stars to "brighten," escalating to the vision where the meteor's question ("being small enough to burn was the same as being brave?") forces crystallization. Cost is visceral—fleck's warmth fading as grief transforms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: vulnerability as "thin, necessary layer that lets light bruise you," not abstraction. Final meteor flare implies ongoing resonance without moralizing; the "heart afterimage" offers a non-literal answer to fragility, avoiding thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: janitor notices "reflections lingered inside the yellow shard longer than physics allowed," filtering cosmos through emotional urgency. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—"he wept then, cosmic janitor in a obsolete observatory"—with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing faintly like a stranded ember" avoids cliché while "bruise you and still you shine" crystallizes theme. Minor paraphrase loop in "hush of the overlooked era" (repeated verbatim) costs 0.1 but misses closure beat, sparing 9.9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic janitor trope through specific mechanics: lantern glass "hoarding star memories," meteor's "dark dialects of iron and ice." Emotional truth anchors risk—quiet closure where vulnerability enables light to "bruise you"—avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
