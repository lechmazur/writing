<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("translator between generations") is embodied through glass-jar method and micro-choices like corking the dune sigh. Contradictory impulses shine when she proceeds despite lacking the great-grandmother's recording, but "throat tightened" slightly edges toward label-speak without immediate embodied follow-through.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: holographic "We are still becoming" reweights memory's purpose with undeniable conceptual cost ("pennies were invitations"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; the dunes humming the "new-old chord" crystallizes Earned Stasis with palpable cost in the child's copper seeds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The feral loft functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (limited space dictates jar storage) and charges closure (dunes' "curved ceiling" for hologram projection). Salt-bleached ship ribs mirror Posy's fragility, but "tide-miles of trash" slightly overreaches plausibility for coastal scavenging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vanishing voices) tightens through Posy's agency: trapping the child's voice forces her to confront missing recordings, escalating to the music box's opening. Cost is legible in the shift from "gleaned redemption" to understanding pennies were "invitations," though escalation remains subtle under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—jars of laughter and steam trains—not moralizing. Final image ("bridge built of every voice") reweights "memory should never be for sale" without stating morals, but "copper seeds" risks slight thematic echo despite functional action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bones humming with lonesome splendor," "air tasted of apricot salt") is consistently character-particular. Rhythmic control peaks during sound-capturing sequences ("dune collapse, sighing like a grandparent settling"), with zero head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gleaned redemption she sought brush her ribs like a cat asking to be named" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language remains coherent under pressure, though "ocean faded to the color of old bruise" slightly strains vehicle logic without compromising closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "memory preservation" trope through glass-jar method and the music box's non-musical resolution. Emotional truth in "grandparent settling into a story" for dune collapse avoids sentimentality, but "copper seeds" leans toward symbolic convenience without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
