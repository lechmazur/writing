<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "glueing rumor to heartbeat" versus poison label's "chemical endings," but flaw-driven mistakes lack escalation; micro-choices like pocketing the ampoule shard reveal hierarchy without compounding errors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the armor formation forecloses path with duct tape's visceral cost ("sealing them with duct tape torn from a broken crate"), and Accumulative lens holds through fragment accumulation to final shimmering solidity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (tide dictates movement) and charge closure; "laminate skin" compression reweights the final image, though "sodium light" slightly genericizes the micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency—each collected fragment narrows options toward the projector's damning evidence, with the poison label's burn crystallizing cost; "calcify into a new name" edges toward thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the duct-taped armor answers "erased histories" without stating morals, while "whistle call" stitching "esophagus to emptiness" avoids false equivalence by honoring specific losses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("city whistles through," "frost curls like cassette ribbon"), with rhythmic compression under pressure; minor register drift in "laminate skin" doesn't undermine the voice's consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "water sucking at pylons like a reader closing a book" demonstrates high density and propulsion, though "cassette ribbon" frost risks borderline mixed metaphor without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "erased histories" through shipping container press metaphor and ampoule counting—specific, non-obvious synthesis where bureaucratic erasure becomes tactile armor; avoids safety middle via visceral duct tape.</comment>
