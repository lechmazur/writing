<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "pressing enough voices together" to prove existence, embodied through tactile memory-smoothing. Final renunciation of official identity earned by prior causality, though the captain's role feels slightly functional rather than fully realized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: discarding the death certificate while stamping the container reconfigures erasure into memorial with undeniable cost ("ink bleed into salt water"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly, though the captain's death edges toward convenient revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choice (climbing tiers as "days she could not reclaim") and charge closure through "phantom whistles emanating from steel." Tide rhythm evolves causally with plot, avoiding static description. Micro-setting gate fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving existence against erasure) tightens through density: collecting fragments → poison label → captain's revelation → active memorialization. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in discarded death certificate. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: gluing recordings to containers reweights "erased histories" without moralizing. Final image ("texture of memories rise beneath her skin like braille") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo despite high conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lungs counting the cadence of brine") and rhythmic control evident in tide-driven cadence shifts. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("aisles glowed with sodium light, others drowned in salt shadow") and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sodium lamps became moons that bled yellow halos" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("rhythm of tides carried on, but now it pulsed with layered stories") recharges motif without muddle. One slightly stock phrase ("lips the color of wet ash") prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "erased history" trope through port-specific mechanics (barcode tattoos, container labyrinths). Fresh inflection: poison label repurposed as memorial template. Avoids safety-middle via bold structural choice—erasure as active tool—but captain's revelation lacks deeper integration.</comment>
