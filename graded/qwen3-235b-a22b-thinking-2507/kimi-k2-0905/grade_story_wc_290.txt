<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s claustrophobia manifests concretely through humming shanties and counting breaths, but childhood reflection ("counting seconds in locked closets") feels convenient rather than altering present tactics. Contradictory impulses (fear vs purpose) drive the key choice, though "wistfully necessary" slightly edges toward abstract justification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the mirror-chamber vision crystallizes stakes (tunnels sealing forever) with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—organ reverberations intensify spatial pressure relentlessly, narrowing options until the compass circle pivot. Orientation anchors instantly ("three deserted railways," "fallow period").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The compass point functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (anchoring it triggers mutiny) and charges the final image (missing pane matching its diameter). Sensory details are purposeful: "night air to thicken into wool" embodies claustrophobia while narrowing perception under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key vs claustrophobia) tightens through spatial mutiny: rails bowing inward and starlight becoming a keyhole force Arin’s choice. Cost is legible when mirrors crack upon taking the key, sealing tunnels forever. Agency lies in her step into the circle—a renunciation that forecloses return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against confinement emerges through spatial mutiny and the final image ("key knocking softly... map still unwritten"). No moralizing; the compass point’s transformation from tool to keyhole reweights the premise with conceptual cost (freedom requires permanent sacrifice).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "notes sliding off curved iron ribs like slow rain" filters sound through cartographer’s spatial lens. Minor deduction for "wistfully necessary"—a slight abstraction that momentarily drifts from embodied urgency during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances atmosphere or pressure. "Timber sleeper cracked open, revealing a narrow shaft" uses strong verbs without flourish. Final line’s rhythm ("key knocking softly... map still unwritten") crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography and claustrophobia: spatial mutiny feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (environment as active force) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—the compass point’s physics-defying shadow circle redefines reality coherently.</comment>
