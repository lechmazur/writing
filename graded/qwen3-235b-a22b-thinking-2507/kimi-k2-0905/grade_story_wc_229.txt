<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (softness vs screaming tenderness) embodied through vial cork ritual; micro-choices like pulse rhythm adjustment reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost ("lived transmitting anyway").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: boat's course correction crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (mother's transformation into vibration); Accumulative lens holds through scent/light/vibration pattern with cost legible in "lived transmitting anyway".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass and garden scent constrain the purification ritual, charging the final image (cork floating with "frequency of everything she couldn't say"); micro-setting drives tactics (heat wave break timing essential for scent transmission).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (whispers vs shouts) tightens through keeper's agency: heat wave's end creates live clock for scent transmission; visible cost is lifelong transmission of unsaid words, narrowing options to "one purified intention at a time".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (boat turning toward harbor) offers resonant answer to "do whispers travel farther?" without moralizing; theme emerges from vial cork's transformation from memory object to transmission tool, reweighting "screaming tenderness" as love's essential frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in scent/light synesthesia ("scent rising like a ghost"); rhythmic control under pressure via heartbeat pulse motif; no head-hopping despite single POV depth in "screaming tenderness" lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound" risks purple prose but justified by motif density; "screaming tenderness" repetition pattern-taught through physical vibration imagery without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via "screaming tenderness" paradox; specificity of cobalt glass/salt air/gardenia chemistry makes premise inevitable; risk-taking (vibrations as travel method) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
