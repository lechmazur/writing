<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "envied yesterday’s version who still thought stories could save her" while signing "a contract with erosion." Motivation to "distill chaos" intensifies into credible endurance as snow dissolves the scroll, foreclosing narrative control with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when snow erases the scroll: "erasure is also a continuation" reweights time’s wheel with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through recursive imagery (sparks, footprints, spirals), orientation clear by line 3, cost undeniable in the vanishing words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll constrains choices (writing in soot, placing on snow) and charges the final image as snow dissolves it. Mountain’s active pressure ("wants its minerals back") and snow’s transformation to "blue glass" directly shape tactics and closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when "feral nostalgia" reframes her crisis as lost sequence, narrowing options to endurance. Agency drives escalation: adding text to scroll, stepping into moonlight, placing it on snow. Cost is visceral in the dissolution reconfiguring meaning under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: scroll’s physical erasure embodies "erasure is continuation" without moralizing. Final image reweights time’s wheel through snow dissolving words, avoiding sentimentality while charging the central question with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lungs full of cedar smoke" and wind "like a page turning." Syntax mirrors disorientation ("unable to decide whether the grave... was prophecy or memory"), compressing under pressure ("She laughed.") with rhythmic control elevating every image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "sparks write brief constellations" compresses metaphor without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies from staccato ("She laughed.") to flowing ("watched her name erode into moss"), accelerating into the dissolution climax. Final line avoids closure clichés with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop tropes through specific, grounded choices: "minerals back" metaphor, eagle’s thermals as "fingers pushing," stone as unrecognized monument. Emotional specificity avoids templates, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
