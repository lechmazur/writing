<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mending what isn't torn" and paternal guilt, but daughter's absence limits embodied conflict; micro-choice of truth-telling earns closure though secondary pressure feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sky cracking reweights "light stolen" with visceral cost ("colors loud as trumpets"); Accumulative lens holds via density escalation where each confession physically alters the orrery's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting constraining choice (truth-telling under lantern's honesty rule), but "bronze snow" rust risks ornamental description; philosopher's chip charges final image yet chamber itself doesn't actively alter tactics beyond ritual setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes braided perfectly: internal guilt ("left her lullaby unfinished") and external light theft escalate through tethering act; cost crystallizes when rust "accepted his unvarnished self," though midnight's origin slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "light stolen, light returned" cycle without moralizing; final painted bird's wings reweight covenant as "someone willing to speak the rust into listening," avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct tinkerer lexicon ("gears pristine yet mute") modulates under pressure; "colors loud as trumpets" slightly overextends auditory motif, but rhythmic control sustains Accumulative lens through confession's cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pockets lighter yet spirit resonant" compresses dual change elegantly. Minor deduction for "dawn climbing scale" metaphor slightly clashing with "balloons" hue imagery in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-box mechanics with covenant theology; "rust accepting unvarnished self as lubricant" transforms tropes through specific tinkerer logic, avoiding derivative light-restoration clichés via chip-in-pocket history.</comment>
