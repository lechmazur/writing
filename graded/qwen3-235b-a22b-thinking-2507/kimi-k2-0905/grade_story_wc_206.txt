<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("mending what isn't torn") manifests in micro-choices: confession reshapes tactics while preserving flaw (fear of dark). Daughter's off-page presence charges final hug with embodied cost—voice trembles, laughter rings "like freshest bells"—avoiding label-only emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens: rust's covenant satisfied by unvarnished confession creates visible cost (Elias's vulnerability) that reconfigures stakes into "light stolen, light returned" balance. Chamber brightening and dawn fissures crystallize the cost without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains every choice: wilts near dishonesty forces truth-telling, copper walls breathe with chimes that guide gear adjustments. Final image—paper bird "exact shade of reclaimed dawn"—charges the recurring object with conceptual cost, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: confession ("I once let my daughter sing alone") transforms technical repair into emotional reckoning, narrowing options to truth or failure. Cost is visceral—rust retreating only after "unvarnished self" offered—making the light's return feel earned, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile precision: "tool roll clinking softly like distant bells," rust "breathing with low hum." Voice modulates under pressure—fragmented syntax during confession ("voice trembling")—while avoiding register drift. No head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "gears began to breathe, exhaling notes" merges action and metaphor without muddle. Final line ("laughter rang like the freshest bells") recharges motif with rhythmic control, avoiding closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes music-box mechanics with emotional truth: "covenant of rust" transforms tropes through specific rules (chamber wilts near dishonesty). Bold risk—reclaiming light via confession—heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing 9+ quick test with "cycle" reconfiguration.</comment>
