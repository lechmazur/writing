<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in wood-grain analysis shows contradictory impulses (seeking father vs understanding thresholds); final choice to step into the maze earned through tactile engagement with logbook and floorboards, with felt cost in perpetual drift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: Juniper's dissolution into the maze reweights "necessary distances" with conceptual cost ("carrying her forward into the necessary distance"). Accumulative lens holds through terrace drift and wood-grain patterns, though slight abstraction in "read the weather in wood" softens final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace constrains choice (movement "never quite touching floorboards") and charges final image; wood grain functions as micro-setting that directly enables the pivotal coordinate discovery at table's heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding sacred thresholds) tighten through Juniper's tactile analysis of logbook and grain, narrowing options to stepping into the maze. Conceptual cost—accepting perpetual drift as necessary—is legible in final terrace image, though escalation leans slightly reflective rather than active.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wood-grain patterns and terrace drift without moralizing; final image ("carrying her forward into the necessary distance") reweights "necessary distances" as both loss and wisdom. Near-miss on 9.0 due to faint thematic echo in "distances teach us to read the weather in wood."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in wood-grain/weather-code synesthesia ("tight grain for drought years"); rhythmic control under pressure ("featherly determined steps") avoids lyric overindulgence. Single POV held with exquisite sensory selectivity matching Juniper's architect-child lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" creates register drift in high-pressure beat; otherwise flawless propulsion. "Pages soft as moth wings" and wood-grain patterns deliver multi-jobbing without muddle, but the adverbial quirk slightly dulls the closure image's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms corn maze trope through weather-code physics and wood-memory metaphysics; "thresholds as story intersections" synthesizes spatial/emotional stakes inevitably. Risk-taking (time-bending maze) heightens coherence without gimmickry, anchored by tangible logbook mechanics.</comment>
