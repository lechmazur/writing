<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "thief's son face" and releasing money as both abandonment and release, with micro-choices like placing specific currencies earning the calm. No secondary pressure present to test relationships under conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in "releasing it so the next wanderer could feel the same hush," under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3; lens holds through "exhaling rust" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned train functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (territorial markers guiding placements) and charges closure via "exhaling rust and dusky harmony." Body/tool specificity (satchel, rusted bar rail) elevates beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cyclical paths) tightens when narrator reinterprets markers as signatures, narrowing options to release money. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in "equally beautiful, equally worthless" realization; accumulative escalation lacks visceral pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through money as "maps of countries that no longer existed," with final image answering "why circle back?" via "teach the traveler how to walk with lighter feet." Truncated last line slightly undermines resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "watermark of a nation’s panic" and rhythmic control during tension ("Footsteps scuffed outside—another pilgrim..."). Diction stays within narrator’s lexicon even under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rustled like applause delayed by years" achieves high density without muddle. Final truncated line ("if you stop trying to") is intentional lyric compression that charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms abandonment trope via startup-circus fusion and "territorial markers as signatures" inflection. Emotional specificity in "equity was a map of a future that would never arrive" avoids generic templates.</comment>
