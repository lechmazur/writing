<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices: labeling "Sorrow Index 3.7" while whispering apologies reveals professional precision warring with empathy. Mara’s recitation of personal memories ("the quiet year her own mother died") during transmutation earns her final renunciation of quantification without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the cedar’s "numbered leaves trembling with residual grief" crystallizes the shift from quantified sorrow to ordinary time. The pin-drop moment at 120 words anchors orientation while teaching the Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sextant-as-micro-setting constrains every choice: its warped frame demands dream-mapping on chalk grids, while moonlight’s healing property directly enables the brass-to-wood transformation. Final image of cedar roots "curled around parapet stones" charges closure by showing setting actively resolving the core conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: dream-capturing beads lower "ambient sorrow by measurable milligrams," tightening pressure through density increase. The refracted spectral trees force Mara’s decisive choice to deconstruct the sextant, with visible cost in the brass "softening into living wood" as she speaks memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the notebook’s shift from "Sorrow Index" labels to "Instructions for Future Repairs" offers non-literal resolution. Final image of cones as "tiny sextants" reweights prior material without moralizing, embodying earned wisdom through the cedar’s ordinary growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara notices "mortar healing" but ignores storm intensity, revealing her maintenance-worker lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short, tactile phrases during deconstruction ("unscrewing brass limb by limb") contrast with lyrical dream descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels multiple functions: "rain hissing against its warped frame" establishes weather, object state, and tension. Figurative language ("dreams like frost") remains coherent in high-pressure beats, with final line’s "metallic note tuning her heart" avoiding sentimentality through precise physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magical repair" trope through specific mechanics: quantified sorrow as measurable "milligrams," moonlight healing only mortar/sextant. Emotional truth in mundane miracles ("moonbeam knitted her split thumbnail") avoids abstraction, with cedar cones as "second chances" feeling inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
