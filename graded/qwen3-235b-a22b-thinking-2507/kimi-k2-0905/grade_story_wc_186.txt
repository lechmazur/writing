<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "blessed/cursed" retrocognition and "coincidences have meaning" motivation, but skeleton discovery lacks embodied emotional layering; mother's death referenced but not dramatized with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "arms open, retrocognition now forward-cast" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("no fall is final"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase in final chord of refracted voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard of hush fused to skeleton’s palms charges the final image—environment constrains choice (pries free = silence) and charges closure; "glass humming pavilion" evolves from moan to chord, mirroring emotional arc without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences matter) tightens through protagonist’s agency: tracking star paths, prying shard, fitting prism—each choice alters tactics with visible cost (desert muteness, pulse "counting every mistake"); coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "rose glow" apologizing on black water; final image ("patterns exist... tower still counts") reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through "refractions of one intention."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "tasted the hour," "tide and star argued," "thistle-down" cloth—all filtered through custodian’s retrocognitive lens; rhythmic control peaks in "splintering into colors that had no names anymore" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "crunching on fragments of skylight that had once sung" compresses history into action. Minor deduction for "retrocognitively blessed" (elevated diction) in high-pressure beat, but payoff in closure redeems it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through "shard of hush" mechanics and retrocognition-as-curse; "thistle-blown hope" synthesizes concrete (thistle) and abstract into fresh emotional lexicon that charges the final image irreducibly.</comment>
