<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via brass leviathan as "borrowed bone" and "palms empty yet heavier" showing embodied cost; Seris remains slightly archetypal but Kael's moon-phase ritual reveals contradictory impulses (regret vs. hope) driving micro-choices like humming the lullaby.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when rope vanishes into mist—forgiveness as "space widened by absence" with palpable cost in Kael's "palms empty yet heavier"; moon-phase synchronization creates meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens by narrowing exchange timing to waxing crescent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parapet constrains choices (gloves prevent stone-bite, rope cast into void) and charges final image—"stone had expanded to make room for possibilities"; drawer pull evolves from pocketed relic to active symbol passed between palms, reweighted in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (forgiveness without victory) tightens when Kael interrupts herald to extract fears—naming fears shrinks them, transforming political exchange into human-scale ritual; cost crystallizes in "weight of recycled mistakes settling into bone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope-knot ritual: grievances cast into void reconfigure "chains as the only shape of history" without moralizing; final image of "coastlines no longer aiming cannons at each other's memories" answers central question through charged particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bruised dawn" and "squid grief" ink; voice modulates from "salt and regret" to "quiet ember" under pressure; single-POV remains anchored as "moon’s calendar etched under his ribs" reflects Kael’s internal rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops—every line propels momentum ("thunder prowled like siege engines"); "furrowed hush where blame thinned to gauze" avoids cliché through specific verbs; only hairline flaw: "recycle mistakes into wisdom" borders aphorism but redeemed by immediate action (placing pull in her palm).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner-exchange trope via moon-phase system and rope ritual; "drawer pull opening rusted shut drawers" synthesizes fresh inflection with emotional truth; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry as mist erases horizon to focus pressure on parapet.</comment>
