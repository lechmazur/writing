<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (amorality vs. secret sentimentality) manifest concretely in the egg-swallowing act, with "inconvenient tug of tears" narrowly avoiding diagnostic label-speak due to immediate frost simile embodiment; guilt calcification and micro-choices under pressure (tracing cracks, swallowing sound) earn the renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when he swallows the sound—"a release completed"—with conceptual cost legible in "amorality is just another cage," while Accumulative/Textural lens (density shift from salt to thunder-crystals) holds from midpoint; lull mechanics create irreplaceable pressure narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as micro-setting constraint: its conductivity enables the egg’s activation, dissolves the map to charge closure, and footprints’ rain-ripples reconfigure the "fractured grace" motif; specificity ("powdered salt filled them like pale ink") directly shapes tactics under drought conditions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (preserving echo before extinction) tightens through protagonist agency—bribing climatologists to manipulate the lull—making the dissolution of the map an unavoidable cost; thunder’s progression from "distant" to "filling the lull" reweights options under Accumulative pressure with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the egg’s dissolution: "preservation was impossible; only echo remained" reweights the premise without moralizing, while rain-filled footprints trembling "as if something inside still struggled to fly" delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in salt/echo duality ("crunch that echoed like distant thunder"), with rhythmic compression during the egg’s activation ("A fracture widened; the egg exhaled...") heightening pressure; no head-hopping and consistent lyrical cadence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "hairline sparks jumped from crack to crack, illuminating the map so brightly" achieves triple duty (action/image/theme) with precise verbs; final line’s "grace refracted through a fractured conscience" avoids muddle through concrete refracted light motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms extinction trope via specific mechanics (swallowing sound as echo-preservation) and moral calculus (amorality as cage); salt flat’s conductivity and rain-ripple footprints synthesize into inevitable, fresh closure without gimmickry.</comment>
