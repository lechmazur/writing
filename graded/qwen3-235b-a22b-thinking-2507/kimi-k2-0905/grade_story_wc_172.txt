<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("amoral saint") and embodied emotion ("nails splitting") are strong, but the philanthropist's climactic choice lacks visible cost—his lithium empire continues unscathed, undermining the "felt cost" requirement for high-band stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as ghosts dissolve into salt, reweighting extinction with conceptual cost. However, the "cost proof test" fails: no on-page sentence makes the philanthropist's sacrifice legible beyond tears, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The salt flat constrains every choice (cracks as map, salt-crusted earth splitting nails) and charges the final image as birds sink into "cracks that formed his map," perfectly meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the music box releases the call, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the birds manifest through magical realism rather than earned causality, and the cost remains conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("fossilized feathers," "corroded green" brass), with the final image offering resonant non-literal answer: "fractured grace that sang." Avoids moralizing but the truncated last line ("they'd released") slightly weakens thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt flat stretched like shattered mirror") and rhythmic control peak during the music box sequence; lyrical compression is taught early and paid off in the ghost flock's dissolution without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with high density ("petrified to stone, its surface etched with fossilized feathers"), but "fractured grace" repetition and slight register drift ("manufactured drought had been his masterpiece") prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms extinction tropes through specific, grounded choices (lithium brine cover story, fossilized egg), with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
