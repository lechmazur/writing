<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (clasp as both anchor and weapon), but whispering advisor lacks embodied agency; fear-child revelation earns closure yet micro-choices remain sparse under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "mirrors arranged to make me look long enough to forgive the reflection" crystallizes cost through dissolving salt and calliope restart; Accumulative lens holds from first line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Funhouse setting actively constrains choices (clasp pins photo, warps corridors); "candied apples and wet copper" exemplifies sensory urgency, while the clasp charges the final image as reclaimed light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density ("dying fireflies" to "bleed became a corridor"), but fear’s weakness revelation lacks causal friction; cost is felt via dissolving mirrors yet protagonist agency slightly passive in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the thing that kills you is already saved" reweights fear as self-forgiveness without moralizing; final light-as-mine image resonates as earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice’s perceptual signature ("roadkill jeweled beneath headlights") remains distinct under pressure; however, advisor’s indistinct presence blurs psychic distance in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax beats, but "repulsive allure" descriptor risks mixed metaphor; line propulsion flawless except minor synonym churn ("luminance" variants) diluting final corridor intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via funhouse-as-mind metaphor; "cotton-candy rot" dissolving into salt shows fresh inflection, yet resuscitation framework borders on familiar near-death convention.</comment>
