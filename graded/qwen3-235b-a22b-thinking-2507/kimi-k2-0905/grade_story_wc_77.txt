<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "words clogged like sawdust" versus physical action, but fear's "throat" metaphor risks stock phrasing. Micro-choices (clasp-pinning) reveal values, though the gray child's motivation lacks prior causality for full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: luminance density escalates pressure to Charged Poise closure where mirrors dissolve into salt. Cost legible in "cotton-candy rot" exhalation, though backstory reflection slightly dilutes present-frame urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Funhouse actively constrains choices—warped corridors force navigation, photo booth mechanics enable the skewering act. Final "lingering luminance" as reclaimed light charges closure, satisfying the 9+ gate through environmental reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the corridor of reflections, narrowing options to the hollow mirror confrontation. Agency is clear in the clasp-pinning act, with cost made undeniable by the funhouse's dissolution and advisor's silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the clasp skewering the photo reweights fear as "a gray child." Final line ("light I finally recognized as mine") offers resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("roadkill jeweled beneath headlights"), but "photographically cursed" slightly violates POV lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless, with no head-hopping despite advisor's presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver talon frozen mid-snatch" pays off in closure. Figurative language remains precise in peak beats ("paper bleed light"), with cadence shifts mirroring emotional escalation toward dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through specific funhouse mechanics—the gray child fear-avatar avoids monstrosity. Emotional truth in "fingertips chewed raw" synthesizes familiarity into freshness, with risk-taking heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
