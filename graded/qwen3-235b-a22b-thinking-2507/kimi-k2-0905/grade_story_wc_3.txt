<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (methodical translator vs grieving daughter) drives key actions; "blurred eyes" and bloodless runes embody grief's cost without labels. Final step onto new plank shows credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape" reweights the entire premise through Mira's embodied action (stepping onto new plank), holding Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor constrains all choices: iron filings for planting, tilting during transition, and sprouting plank extending the bridge. Final image charged by environment ("horizons that had not existed") directly shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: leaf patterns → micro-glyphs → skin runes → cuneiform bloom. Cost crystallizes when the sprout draws "bloodless runes," narrowing options to embodied vulnerability. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seed's transformation reweights "haunted ambitions" into "love that hasn't learned how to change shape." Final line avoids moralizing by charging the bridge extension with earned conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured wind shear the way lullabies measure fear") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in high-stakes beats ("filament of living mercury that climbed her wrist"), though "voice cracking" slightly edges toward label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "obsidian glass" and "cuneiform micro-glyphs" achieve textural specificity. Minor rhythm dip with "voice cracking" but no figurative muddle. Final line's equation avoids purple prose through character logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes cuneiform translation with quantum grief into fresh emotional logic. Risk-taking (physics metaphors for love) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the magnetic arbor's rules feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
