<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mira’s "kindly methodical" nature versus flickering-lantern vulnerability; embodied grief in cracked voice and blurred eyes when seed reacts to "return" glyphs avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to step onto new plank earns closure through prior causality of translating mother’s waveform.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing ("haunted ambitions are just love that hasn’t learned how to change shape") with undeniable cost: Mira’s lifetime of grief reframed as love needing transformation. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (filings→cuneiform→silver sprout) and cadence shift at "She laughed, because love over time is velocity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor’s iron filings constrain choice (planting seed in rail joints) and charge final image (obsidian glass bloom becoming new plank). Sensory hierarchy masterful: "iron leaves clicking in Morse-like patterns" filtered through translator’s ear, crisis narrowing to tactile seed warmth and lullaby’s wind-shear notes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: transcribing iron-leaf Morse reconfigures "haunted ambitions" from abstract grief to literal demand ("ambitions can be haunted... demand you finish"). Cost crystallizes when sprout draws bloodless runes—love’s velocity requiring sacrifice of static mourning, made visible in the arbor’s tilt and mirrored sky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cuneiform micro-glyphs ("return," "reside," "release") reweight "haunted ambitions" into non-literal answer at closure. Avoids moralizing; final line’s "love that hasn’t learned how to change shape" charges prior material without stating a moral, embracing complexity through silver sprout’s bloodless transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</question><grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: translator’s mind converts iron-leaf clicks into "wedge-shaped sign for ‘sky’," with rhythmic control intensifying under pressure ("She repeated it aloud, voice cracking"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from methodical wax-tablet transcription to lyrical velocity equations without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing like a slowed heart" and "mercury filament" achieve high density without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly: short staccato ("Nothing happened") against lyrical closure cadence. Minor deduction for "voice cracking" bordering on bodily cliché, but redeemed by immediate seed reaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through cuneiform physics metaphor ("love over time is velocity"), avoiding abstraction. Specific verifiable detail: lullaby measuring "wind shear the way lullabies measure fear" synthesizes occupation and emotion. Risk-taking (math as emotional resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
