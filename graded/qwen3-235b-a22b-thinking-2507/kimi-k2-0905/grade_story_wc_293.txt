<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (crushing glass flake vs. hesitation), but hitchhiker's motivation remains opaque despite pivotal role; "sculpt possibility" drive feels earned through violin-as-tool action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: doorway transformation with "visible cost" in grinding the flake ("luminous dust that clung to their palms"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through pixel-grid thawing and scaffold-wrap "go, go, go" cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (violin/glass flake) constrains every choice—bow tension to flake-crushing—and charges final image; "guardrail shadow shaped like doorway" reweights asphalt footprints with environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s agency (translating tarp flutters into arpeggios), but hitchhiker’s vanishing lacks causal escalation; "pixelated amnesty" tightening narrows options when flake "grew warm," yet cost feels abstract until final crushing gesture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through collodion-as-seed metaphor: "never is just another pixel waiting to be moved" reweights opening’s "slow photograph" without moralizing, embracing complexity via fractured hitchhiker reconstruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "dynamically observant" wind-pitch attention; syntax shifts ("She touched bow to string... luminous disbelief made audible") modulate stress without head-hopping, though "dynamically observant" label slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "dusk bled... like slow photograph" risks overwriting density; "bone-dry clay back to life" metaphor slightly strains under pressure, yet "scaffold-wrap Morse against her ankles" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of wet-plate photography with bridge construction tarps transforms "pixelated amnesty" into visceral stakes; risk-taking (lyric causality) heightens coherence through "emulsion cracked into perfect squares" charging every turn.</comment>
