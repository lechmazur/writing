<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("never" vs mandate) manifests in micro-choices like bow tightening and hesitation before crushing the flake; embodied emotion via "luminous disbelief made audible" avoids therapy-speak. Hitchhiker's off-page presence limits relationship crucible depth despite strong singular POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when she steps into the doorway with visible cost (crushing the glass flake), reconfiguring "never" into actionable pixels under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 1 with pullout anchor; no causality breaks in pivotal vanishing/reconstruction beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (scaffold wrap, collodion flake) constrains choices—she reads wind-language to translate the hitchhiker's path—and charges the final image (tarps applauding in wind-language). Asphalt footprints and guardrail shadow evolve causally with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "single verdict of 'never'", escalating through violin-playing that "sculpts possibility" with tangible cost (grinding pixels into dust). Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens; hitchhiker's reconstruction forecloses "never" with conceptual price paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "pixel granted amnesty from silence" offers non-literal answer to "never" vs "maybe" without moralizing. Theme emerges from collodion-as-seed metaphor reweighted through action, avoiding abstraction or thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusk bled... slow photograph developing") persists under pressure; rhythmic control evident in "snap for danger, ripple for safe passage" tarp translation. No head-hopping; elision of hitchhiker's backstory taught early via "ghost limb of possibility".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "squares shifting like stop-motion confession" achieves high density without muddle. Minor register drift in "dynamically observant" (corporate diction) costs 0.1 but doesn't obscure closure. Final line's "keep going" refrain avoids template cadence through purposeful repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of wet-plate photography, bridge-building, and music creates fresh "pixelated amnesty" concept. Risk-taking (lyric structure, collodion-as-seed) heightens stakes coherently; "wireframe waiting for skin" reconfiguration feels earned from prior particulars.</comment>
