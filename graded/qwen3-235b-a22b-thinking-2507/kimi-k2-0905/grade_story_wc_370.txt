<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "staying while leaving" micro-choice, but empathy trait occasionally leans conceptual rather than embodied during high-pressure Vale confrontation; flaw compounding feels earned through invitation’s physical transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: blank invitation + "woman-shaped hush" crystallizes conceptual cost of surrendering future; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through sensory density shifts; "years later" epilogue risks dilution but earns payoff via atlas recursion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble lectern and chained grimoires constrain choices (hiding/kneeling); invitation’s physicality charges final image; "enlarged tranquility" reweights library-as-character by closure; sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (correcting past mistake) tightens through Vale’s approach; Elara’s kneeling choice forecloses escape with felt cost; "bring the gift of absence" deepens into conceptual trap; escalation driven by protagonist’s surrender, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through invitation’s transformation: "wisdom blooms from owning the flaw" avoids moralizing via atlas recursion; near-miss on final-paragraph thematic echo ("greatest presence is gentlest absence") but saved by concrete "dust motes in lantern light" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tasting latent emotions" of books; rhythmic control peaks with "seconds into silk" compression; zero head-hopping despite multi-POV epilogue; voice modulates from lyrical to stark under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "rustling like trapped moth" slightly clichéd but redeemed by "invitation drunk its writer whole"; nominalizations ("mis-delivery," "surrendering") serve voice; final line achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Secret society trope transformed by metro-station mundanity and empathy-as-library-mechanic; "benevolent hush" synthesis feels inevitable; risks lyrical compression but payoff lands via tangible dust motes; avoids safety middle through morally ambiguous guardian role.</comment>
