<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in inherited "senselessly perceptive eyes" noticing blood-fertilized roses while choosing pacifism; micro-choices like weaving sandbag scrap reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "father's restless spirit finally finding rest."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "faint pulse of roots taking hold" crystallizes options with conceptual cost under Accumulative lens; single deepening beat (night grafting) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome functions as micro-setting constraining choice (working through night); "canvas weave" stems charge final image by transforming violence into growth, meeting 9+ gate through environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One tightening beat (grafting sandbag) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "refusing to let chaos break the thread," with agency driving the reconfiguration of "destruction into purposeful" growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from blood-fertilized roses to "braiding threads into something stronger"; final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer to "weaving continuity through chaos."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of roses and ruin," "engraved quiet") modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression taught early ("three days prior") pays off in closure's "tranquil blaze" reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "burnished copper" petals show textural specificity doing triple duty (symbolism, texture, closure); no figurative muddle despite high-pressure grafting scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter's daughter" trope through horticultural method; emotional truth in synthesis of "hunter and pacifist" avoids safety middle, with fresh inflection in "canvas weave" stems charging closure.</comment>
