<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete embodiment ("pulse matched distant storm"), but fugue-state backstory lacks on-page struggle during planting. Micro-choices like redirecting vines with "receptive" hands earn endurance, though "possibility just born" edges toward label-speak near climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: Mira's covenant with the building carries visible cost ("luminous specks... grow into new puzzles"). Hybrid lens (textural dominant) holds through brook reversal and guest departure, with conceptual cost legible in "storm-born silence now threaded with perfume."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook reverses to become active puzzle element (waterwheel clicks dial), not backdrop. Final image charges setting with meaning as "quiet ally," satisfying 9+ gate: environment constrains choices and reweights innovation theme through concrete action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally from thunderclap deadline to architectural shift, but "second thunderclap" urgency vanishes post-planting. Cost is unmistakable in surrendering control ("teaching a haven to write its own riddles"), though escalation lacks one felt price for near-miss timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through phosphorescent seeds as literal "wonder," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "safeguarding innovation" as surrender ("mystery seed mail had never been about the corpse flower"), delivering resonant non-literal answer without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "gears clicked like anxious teeth" and brook's hush amplifying creaks. Rhythm modulates from lyrical to urgent, though "notably receptive" slightly disrupts Mira's lexicon during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots erupted outward, not downward" shows syntactic purpose. Near-flawless density, but "possibility just born" repetition risks slight dilution despite contextual deepening in the final use.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms escape rooms via botanical horror: corpse flower literally reshapes architecture. Risk-taking (brook reversal as puzzle mechanic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in "decay rather than perfume" trade-off.</comment>
