<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines in "balance was the first law" motivation, but pretender's sudden exposure lacks contradictory impulses; "regally unpretentious" trait powers actions yet edges toward label-heavy abstraction in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly with dust-mote coronet dissolving—cost of erased identity legible in "stranger wearing ambition," but "seventh night" timeframe doesn’t pressure choices to qualify for 9.5+ constraint gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Leaning shelves physically mirror "graceful collapse" climax, charging final image with "shelves an inch closer to earth"; iron gall’s specificity enriches but doesn’t constrain mid-scene tactics to clear 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through "throne weighed by illusion" premise, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ink pellet acts autonomously during sundering, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens despite resonant deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "truth drifts" marginalia and final "ink yet to fade" image, avoiding moralizing; "history must practice mercy" risks sentimentality but "rust smell" reminder grounds complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("smelled faintly of storms") and rhythmic control excel, though semicolon-heavy syntax in "Orion’s belt hung slack" passage briefly slows momentum under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Footfalls softer than parchment breath" risks figurative overload pre-climax; minor density slip in high-pressure beat triggers −0.3 artifact penalty, just missing 9+ zero-loop standard despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "false king" trope via iron gall mechanics and dust-mote coronet; "diminutive titan" specificity avoids derivative pitfalls, but premise’s core remains recognizable without radical reconfiguration for 9.0+.</comment>
