<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Elara's "could not say whether from loss or completion" amid memorial completion; embodied grief in "ghost of its texture against her fingertips" avoids label-speak. Flaw: "ephemeral" risks abstraction but saved by concrete cloud-soil dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably—the memorial's dissolution into migration reconfigures "temporary permanence" with palpable cost (fading cloud-soil imprints, ghost-wing sensation). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density escalation in butterfly swarm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cloud-soil grotto constrains every choice: roots dissolving by nightfall force urgency; wire catches starlight to charge final image. Fern fronds aren't backdrop but structural elements in memorial. "Moss and mineral" breath anchors physicality under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: knotting wire becomes renunciation ritual as butterflies test each join. Cost crystallizes in the memorial's lift—"silver wire catching sunlight as it rose"—reconfiguring honoring as active surrender, not passive tribute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of "silver wire caught starlight, carrying stories on wings that would never land" delivers non-literal answer to "how to honor the overlooked?" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from wire cathedrals dissolving, not grandmother's quoted wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bark bore scars of lightning," "flight pattern an interrupted cadence") filters all description through Elara's wire-weaving ethos. Rhythmic control peaks as butterfly landings sync with "hammering heart," compressing diction without voice loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "blushing stillness" evolves from opening tone to closing void without redundancy. "Translucent amber veined with black" achieves high density. Minor cadence risk in "roots transiently rooted" offset by intentional alliteration serving theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "butterfly memorial" trope through concrete mechanics: wire as historical signal, wings as "second skin." Fresh inflection in honoring via dissolution. Slight hedging in "esoteric realist" label prevents 9-band despite strong synthesis.</comment>
