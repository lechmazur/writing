<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("Logic said... yet intuition hummed") with embodied micro-choices (chalk circle, flame strike) earning the fusion of axiom and astonishment. Slight lack of secondary pressure limits the 9-band despite flawless final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("rearranged in axis") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Starling pattern break reweights stakes perfectly, though "final transformation" abstraction slightly obscures cost legibility in one line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (orchard inverted within the drop) and constrains tactics (starling coordinates). Mica roots and scent cues create tactile pressure without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake escalation via protagonist agency—doubt to decisive crystal dissolution—narrows options with unmistakable cost ("unravel the seam between knowable and known"). Single deepening (starling coordinates) suffices perfectly for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: crystal melting becomes the non-literal answer to harmonizing logic/intuition. Final line ("to sing it rightly") resonates without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps in the crucial last paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate ("wind sighed through the canyon," "tasted metallic") with rhythmic control under pressure. Syntactic compression during flame ritual ("She drew... struck... Flame leapt") heightens stakes without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "transparent, burning without heat" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline abstract phrase ("hush before creation") avoids overwriting penalty through concrete anchoring in the crystal's physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ornithology and alchemy transforms tropes—starling patterns as coordinate system feels inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual closure (no physical change, only perceptual rewiring) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
