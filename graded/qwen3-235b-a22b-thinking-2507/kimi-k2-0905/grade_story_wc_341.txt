<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (fear of forgetting vs falling) is embodied in concrete micro-choices like labeling cloud emotions as "tastes like burnt coffee." Contradictory impulses act simultaneously as cable frays, with final renunciation of survival earned by generational stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mara stepping into void surrounded by memory kites reconfigures "empty spaces" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory-density escalation ("Regret, 03:17... tastes like burnt coffee"), no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brass telescope functions as micro-setting constraining choices—threading filament through sight, final memorial—and charges closure ("brass telescope full of spooled wholeness"). Every detail serves pressure: "wicker floor shedding dust like miniature galaxies" under zero-g.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative escalation: each filament reading ("Joy, 03:22... smells like rain on hot tarmac") reweights dominant stake as cable frays. Cost crystallizes in final image where Mara becomes part of transmitted memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—no thematic statements. Final image ("child points at falling star... brass telescope full of spooled wholeness") offers resonant non-literal answer to "do empty spaces remember?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: meteorologist noticing cloud emotions as "sighs of lovers," brass telescope as sensory anchor. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("filament glowed quietly explosive"), zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("cities flicking on like match heads" advances setting/theme/time). Final line’s propulsion ("proving even empty spaces keep every feeling") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms meteorology trope via "spooled wholeness"—emotional specificity ("airport goodbyes," "propeller trying to remember its name") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (memory kites as scientific data) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
