<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("ambition erode another micron") but ghost lacks agency beyond symbolic function; micro-choices like breaking the camera wheel reveal values yet contradictory impulses in peak moments remain underdeveloped for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (dissolving bench, broken camera), but one tightening beat narrowing options—beyond lyrical deepening—is missing despite strong Accumulative lens coherence through the carousel's restart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon actively constrains choices (mirrored walkway altering gait, cloudwater rising to record motion), with the disposable camera wheel functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image of dissolving fragments on silver water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with the ghost) is clear and resonant, but escalation lacks tangible pressure escalation; the "shared erosion" deepening reweights meaning without narrowing options or altering tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards"), with the final dissolution of images into "emulsified dreams" offering non-literal resolution to the central question of eroded ambition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice mastery in fractured syntax ("yesterday I buried tomorrow’s body") mirrors chronological confusion, but ghost’s dialogue slightly converges with protagonist’s lexicon during climax, reducing distinction at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances multiple elements (e.g., "twenty-four undeveloped squares spill out" propels plot, character, and theme), though "syllable of my own name spoken backwards" edges toward overwritten lyricism in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-bending tropes through specific mechanics (camera wheel as regret-collector), with "emulsified dreams" payoff feeling inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
