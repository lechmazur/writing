<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in scavenger's fragmented self ("eroded ambitions" vs. collecting fragments), but ghost lacks specific flaws beyond archetypal hunger. Micro-choices like offering "small regrets" reveal value hierarchy, though ghost's motives remain underdeveloped despite pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands perfectly: "ghost steps through and becomes me" crystallizes identity cost. Accumulative lens holds as each surrendered year deepens pressure ("ghost grows an inch taller"), with 2045's erasure forcing irreversible trade-off. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cloud platform functions as micro-setting constraining choices (deflating with each step), and moon-camera charges the final mirror image. But kinetic lagoon's "neon horses" feel ornamental—vivid yet minimally pressure the protagonist's tactics despite atmospheric richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: surrendering 1998 ("learning to walk only taught me to run away") forecloses maternal memory, then 2015's photography ambition erasure visibly costs camera-shaped scar. Each choice narrows options under Accumulative lens, with ghost's "You owe me the rest" tightening pressure relentlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented identity emerges through concrete particulars (bartender's sigh fragment, "shard of mirror" motif), avoiding moralizing. Final mirror image—"ghost steps through and becomes me"—resonantly answers "what is self?" without abstraction, though "eroded ambitions" concept slightly over-tells in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon was a disposable camera wheel") and rhythmic control under pressure shine, with intentional elision taught early ("years arrive as rotating snapshots"). Slight register drift in "fractured stillness" phrasing jars momentarily, but voice modulates brilliantly from humming poles to whispered regrets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dandelion seed" and "fog: cold, slow" exemplify high-density imagery. One near-miss: "silence that rings in broken teeth" slightly strains logic, but final fragment ("yet oddly") uses intentional fragmentation without muddle. Propulsion never falters even in high-pressure exchanges.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms carousel ghost trope via memory fragmentation mechanics ("pocket whatever frame feels heaviest"). Risk-taking heightens stakes—disposable camera as time device—without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "bride's doubt... tastes like copper" avoids abstraction, making erasure feel viscerally earned.</comment>
