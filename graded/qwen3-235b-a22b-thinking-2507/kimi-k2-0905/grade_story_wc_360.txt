<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quince’s embodied contradictions shine ("memories tilted toward gutter") with astronomer/widow duality creating authentic tension; micro-choices like backward name-printing earn closure’s blank heart cost despite secondary characters leaning conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("heart blank as unprinted paper"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts (halo glow → child of light) and final reversal’s star-rekindling price; only minor abstraction in "mathematics of emotion" slightly softens causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Topaz dome and halo fragment constrain choices (press reversal) and charge the final image; sensory details like "moon-silver ink" and "spectral tears" filter through Quince’s profession with crisis-narrowed perception ("lungs full of lucid turbulence").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Quince’s agency: borrowing astronomer’s logic intensifies widow’s grief collision, narrowing options to press reversal; cost is legible in weightless heart but "hunger for pattern/presence" phrasing slightly over-articulates the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (reversing press = releasing souls), avoiding moralizing; final line’s "shine is to be alone together" reweights prior math with earned ambiguity; no thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaden fractions of sense") and rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during disorientation); free indirect style maintains Quince’s lexicon ("eigenvalues of sorrow") without head-hopping despite layered voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines like "ink flowed uphill, letters lifted" propel closure; "lucid turbulence" risks abstraction but earns texture through bodily integration; final image’s crystalline clarity avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mechanics with emotional physics transforms tropes; halo fragment’s seven-ray stitching of constellations feels inevitable yet revelatory; risks lyrical density without sacrificing causal integrity in closure.</comment>
