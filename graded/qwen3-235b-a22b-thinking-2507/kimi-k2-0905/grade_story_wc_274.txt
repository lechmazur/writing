<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bravely conflicted") manifests in concrete micro-choices like weighing duty against conscience, but "bravely conflicted" remains partially labeled rather than embodied through simultaneous contradictory actions during the inciting incident. Motivation for risking archive destruction is credibly earned by her core purpose ("preserve every story"), though the hesitation beat occurs off-page before the alarm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise: Sera sealing the pod while the city erupts crystallizes options (burning archive vs. reborn truth) with undeniable conceptual cost ("flame cannot catch what the wind carries"). Orientation anchors ("cryogenic archivist," "library under snow") establish within 40 words, and accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts toward the upload's "hissing like distant applause" climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow-buried library constrains every choice—narrow shafts force crawling, permafrost layers affect data transmission, and "dizzying quiet" enables her detection of the letter's glow. Final image ("library no longer a tomb but a cradle rocking under snow") charges closure by reweighting snow from obstacle to generative force, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Sera's agency: uploading via dormant networks (not coincidence) narrows options to "topple governances or ignite mobs," with cost legible in her whispered promise to burn with the books. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via sensory escalation (hissing copper, snow-dusted histories), though the "tremor of guilt" moment slightly softens the trade-off's immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "contraband truths" reweighted from "live coal" to "wind-carried" liberation in the final line, rejecting "scandalize" for communal reckoning. Avoids moralizing by showing truth's dual nature (toppling power vs. burning archives) through Sera's choice, with the cradle/snow image offering non-literal resolution to "honest memory" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in cryo-archivist lexicon ("data veins," "thermal sleeve") and stress-distorted attention ("exhalations became falling snow"). Rhythmic control peaks during upload sequence with staccato urgency ("Hands shaking, she coupled..."), while elisions (off-page hesitation) are taught early via "decades of frozen sleep" and paid off in her decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; sentences like "snow sifted from the dome’s ruptured seams, dusting rows of frozen histories" compress setting and stakes. Only minor register drift: "tremor of guilt rattled her" uses borderline cliché "rattled" in high-pressure beat, slightly muddling embodied emotion but not harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing cryo-archivist tropes with tangible stakes—truth as physical "fiber-thin transmitter" escaping through permafrost. Avoids abstraction via specific mechanics (stolen power for dormant networks), while risk-taking (quiet closure amid explosions) heightens thematic weight without gimmickry, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
