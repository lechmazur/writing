<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s interiority shines via concrete micro-choices (sleeve concealment, trembling hands) that manifest her duty/conscience conflict, though rapid moral crystallization lacks intermediate struggle between initial shock and decisive action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: Sera’s resealing forecloses escape with visible cost ("If you burn, I will burn with you"), while the library’s shift from "tomb" to "cradle" reweights meaning under a coherent Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The snow-buried library actively constrains Sera’s choices (narrow shafts, melting breath on copper), and the final "woman half ice, half fire" image charges the setting with irreplaceable thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth preservation vs. institutional lies) tightens through Sera’s agency—uploading via dormant networks narrows options to exile or complicity, with the archive’s potential destruction as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "flame cannot catch what the wind carries" resonates as a non-literal answer to memory’s fragility, avoiding moralizing while deepening the central question of truth’s survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath frosting," "falling snow that melted on live copper") modulates under pressure, though rare elevated diction ("contraband truths flickered") slightly strains cryo-archivist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold, but "hissing like distant applause" risks mixed metaphor in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling the closure’s tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival duty and truth activism avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details (data veins, dream implants), though the cryo-archivist premise leans on established sci-fi conventions without radical transformation.</comment>
