<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation and embodied emotion shine (e.g., heart hammering after bell chime), but secondary characters like Arin/Tamar remain symbolic rather than pressured individuals, weakening relationship dynamics. Contradictory impulses act in scene, yet the youths' transition to donors lacks sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ringing the unwrapped bell crystallizes "we are lifting each other" with undeniable conceptual cost (Lila's chronicle sealed in wax, flour vanishing). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned deepening, and the final image reconfigures the bell's meaning with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor isn't backdrop but active constraint—its numbered tiles become the community's archive, and saffron ink on flatbread shows setting directly altering tactics. Final image of warm tiles under moonlight charges closure with environmental specificity that shapes every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening tactics (bell chime → milk donation, saffron ink) drives pressure under Accumulative lens, with visceral cost (Lila's death, vanished flour). But the sanctions' tightening lacks a narrowing of options; stakes deepen without a decisive trade-off in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "communion not smuggling" and "arithmetic of return" avoid moralizing. The final bell-ringing offers a non-literal answer to persistence, reweighting the arbor's tiles as living text without stated moral. No thematic echo; complexity lingers in "investment" vs. "mercy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clay tiles humming with wind carrying scent of blocked harbors") and rhythmic control under pressure elevate the Accumulative lens. Minor register drift in "echo inside our bones" slightly undermines voice, but patterned elision (time jumps) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "powdered milk and a note written in the old alphabet" exemplifies high-density prose. Only slight abstraction in "echo inside our bones" risks diluting momentum, but rhythmic variation and concrete verbs ("melted the wax," "ground the saffron") propel the narrative relentlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes through specific, grounded choices: saffron ink on flatbread, tile-number memorization. The bell's evolution from tool to archive container feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (time compression) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing universality through lived detail.</comment>
