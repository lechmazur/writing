<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("defiant artist" vs burdened by refusal) embodied in micro-choices like mischievous tone during confession; "weight did not lift" shows earned endurance with visceral cost. Only minor slip: insight about listening price slightly over-articulated for crisis moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("I accept the cost" cracking spire) lands with undeniable conceptual cost (feather as sufficient burden) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored by word 10 ("canyon of endless echoes"); lens held flawlessly through ritual's approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spire functions as micro-setting constraining choices (climbing ledge, mirror angling) and charging closure (feather release). Bone towers pressure tactics via echo multiplication; "mist began to swirl into shapes" evolves causally with confession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (refracting blame) tightens when she stops reciting to listen—a meaningful deepening that narrows options from speaking to bearing weight. Cost crystallizes in "forehead to spire" moment with spire's absorption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete refracting: "coin with two faces" poem becomes embodied in feather-as-bridge painting. Final image reweights premise ("truth—refracted, shared, borne") without moralizing; no thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("wind sounded like held breath," "mist swirl into shapes") with rhythmic control modulating from mischievous to visceral. Zero head-hopping; all details filtered through artist's embodied observation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bone vibrating like plucked wire" shows rather than tells. Minor deduction: "forged hush" slightly abstract (3.5-4.9 range per rubric), but "seam of light opening like an eye" compensates with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness trope via physical refracting—spire-as-prism device feels inevitable yet fresh. "Doubled shadow: one dark, one echo" synthesizes theme/image uniquely; no derivative elements. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
