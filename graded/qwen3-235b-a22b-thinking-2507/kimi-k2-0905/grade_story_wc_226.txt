<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("refuse to bear blame" vs "refusal echoed in ribs") and embodied emotion ("echoes in ribs") drive micro-choices; "I accept the cost" earns renunciation through prior causality with visible cost (spire cracking, feather).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: doubled shadow and feather crystallize the "refracted truth" stake; drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to the spire's crack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The pale spire constrains every choice—angled mirror, whispered confession, fracture—and charges the final image; bone towers multiply echoes that pressure Lira’s crisis without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake ("refract truth to avoid blame") tightens through failed recitations until listening forces renunciation; cost is visceral in "spire cracked" and "weightless yet sufficient" feather.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light and "coin with two faces," avoiding moralizing; final image ("cracks would be bridges") reweights the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind sounded like held breath," "mist flaked like old skin") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("bone vibrating like a plucked wire" does triple duty); "feather floated into her hand" avoids figurative muddle in peak closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness trope through physical refraction metaphor; emotional specificity in "I walked away because your fire felt warmer than your regret" avoids generic templates.</comment>
