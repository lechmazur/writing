<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions like tracing the key; micro-choices reveal Lyra’s hierarchy of values when she trades her shadow. Flaws: "quietly deliberate" trait isn’t tested under pressure—no visible tradeoff when closing loops.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: shadows reattaching carries conceptual cost ("hearts heavier with weight shed"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as density peaks at the sundial moment. Minor deduction: lens clarity delayed past midpoint without explicit teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (key, orrery rings) charges closure—rings form Möbius band, key seals awakening. "Silver spoons" violate established spoon-bending physics, slightly dulling the final image’s coherence. No penalty waiver for disorientation since anchors appear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lyra’s agency: winding key backward narrows options to one path. Cost is legible ("hearts heavier") but escalation lacks visceral pressure—shadow migration feels effortless, missing a live option foreclosure during the spiral descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "geometry of absence" to "remembering what absence teaches," reweighted by the final sigil. Avoids moralizing but the whispered rune risks thematic echo; saved by being action-bound (shadows reattaching) not stated outright.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra notices brass grooves, silk-like shadows. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" lexicon during climax. No dialogue, so voice coherence shines—lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "shadows rushed back... silent migration" exemplifies propulsion. One paraphrase loop: "relearn what the bending unlearned" slightly echoes later "relearn the world." Figurative language never muddles causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bent reality transforms shadow physics into emotional metaphor. "Sealed awakening" redefines tropes via Lyra’s sacrifice—no safety hedging. Risk-taking (Möbius night) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
