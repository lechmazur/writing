<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied trauma (tasting ash, stolen voices) drives credible choices; "carefully reckless" manifests in anechoic chamber practice. Final endurance as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost when voice becomes symphony. Slight over-reliance on "symphonies of truth" phrase risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes when ink well shatters—cost is visible in transformed voice and broken prisms. Accumulative lens holds: harmonic layers tighten pressure toward unsnarling silence. Orientation anchors ("extinct language archive") by paragraph one; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive hum matching lullaby frequency constrains choice; glass ink well evolves from memory-carrier to closure-charging prism. Sensory specificity (carbon-suspended ink, ash-tasting voice) avoids white-room syndrome. Minor overwriting in "coffin of sound" slightly dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as weaponized language) tightens via recursive promises; third promise's danger narrows options. Cost is unmistakable: voice becomes symphony, ink well shatters. Agency drives escalation—Elara's writing triggers harmonic resonance. Torn treaty section feels slightly convenient but paid off by negative-space revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "interconnected promises" as reborn bridge, not weapon—no moralizing. Final image ("some things must break") reweights silence without stating moral. Avoids false binaries by showing language's dual nature. Slight risk of thematic echo in repeated "symphonies of truth" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct academic-poetic voice ("cautious exuberance," "prism of possible futures") modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature shines in linguistic details (phonetic codices, harmonic resonances). Minor register drift in "recursive loops of obligation" risks corporate diction during high-stakes writing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("glass ink well catching light like prisms of possible futures" sets tone and foreshadows closure). Template cadence in "She wrote... The second promise... The third promise" slightly dulls climax. Zero loops in final beats; closure image ("fragments catching sunrise") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistic weaponization as harmonic resonance feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in "voice-tasting-ash" avoids templates. Risk-taking (sound as neural rewiring) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative premise guardrail avoided by grounding in archival linguistics.</comment>
