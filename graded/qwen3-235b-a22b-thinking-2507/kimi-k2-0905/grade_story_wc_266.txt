<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic phrasing "unused courage" triggers penalty; hound's motivation told not embodied. Marta/Jun lack contradictory impulses despite strong archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with cost (hound's whimper), but ambiguous drive lens past midpoint prevents 8.8+. "Leash break" causality holds yet internal realization dominates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ticket punch functions as micro-setting charging closure; star stamps constrain choices and reconfigure final image. Sensory specificity anchors twilight urgency without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite strong setup; no visible price paid during search. "Unused courage" concept lacks visceral escalation though internal/external conflicts interweave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Final image reweights "unused courage" without moralizing, but Marta's closing thought skirts thematic echo penalty. Wisdom arises from concrete stamping action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shoreline lullaby" texture) persists under pressure. Jun's modern cadence slightly jars but "veiled ridgeway" diction teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ethereal paw prints" metaphor risks overwriting but paid off by breath-on-glass callback. Final paragraph avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ferry guide trope transformed by star-stamp mechanics and hound's internal crisis. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
