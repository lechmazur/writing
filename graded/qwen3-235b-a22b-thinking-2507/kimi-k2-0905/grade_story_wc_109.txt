<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly embodied ("bare toes gripping salt-slick stone") but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; "mildly obsessed" remains label-driven without visible tradeoffs during key map-drawing pressure. Final renunciation as "first coordinate" earns cost but lacks micro-choice escalation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when darkness pours yet map glows, with conceptual cost in star's extinction and fort dissolution. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase ("margins gasped," "map grew heavier") reweights silence's value. No orientation debt; anchors established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort constrains choice via salt-slick stone and crenels, while the gold-leaf booklet charges the final image as "living hush." Sensory details ("taste of iron," "mineral patience") evolve with plot, but micro-setting dominance slightly overshadows broader environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving silence via map) tightens through density accumulation ("compressing decades into graphite line"), narrowing options as star dims. Cost is unmistakable in physical dissolution of fort/oracle, though escalation lacks a single visceral "tightening" beat beyond lyrical deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: map as "borderless smudge" staining skin reweights "endless night" from dread to cradle. Final image ("pebbles turning under invisible tides") offers non-literal answer to "how silence survives," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("star elongating into a tear that refused to fall"), with rhythm modulating from keening wind to "mineral patience." But minor register drift in "cartographing oblivion" slightly disrupts oracle's embodied voice during high-stress map completion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters in high-pressure beats: "pages trembling like moth wings" and "glittering dust that clung to fingerprints" stack metaphors where sparse action would heighten tension. Near-closure "liquid obsidian" metaphor risks muddling the dissolution climax's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "oracle mapping silence" through specific, irreplaceable mechanics (angled brackets for pre-thunder, spiral for heartbeat pause). Bold risk in making silence the active antagonist earns freshness, though "pebble-shore" specificity edges close to quirky ornament without deeper integration.</comment>
