<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly embodied ("quill scratched faster from tenderness") but lacks contradictory impulses; obsession deepens linearly without visible internal conflict. Micro-choices like silencing the guard reveal value hierarchy, yet the oracle’s flawless execution undercuts struggle, missing the earned flaw-driven cost required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully as Charged Poise: "Here begins the navigable dark" reconfigures the map into a functional tool with conceptual cost (the fort’s erasure). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably—the density of summarized silences tightens the stakes until the final signature, making the vanishing world legible as stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flaking gold-leaf booklet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure: its physical decay forces urgency, and the fort’s transposition into its pages makes the object indispensable. Sensory specificity ("salt-swollen pages," "shadow pooled at her feet") avoids static description by evolving with the oracle’s actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the oracle’s agency—each summarized silence narrows her temporal window as the star dims and fort shrinks, culminating in the ink-from-shadow choice. The cost is visceral: soldiers’ names erased by wind, making the abstract "endless night" concretely felt without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "navigable dark" reweights silence as communal rather than empty, avoiding moralizing. The final constellation of hushes offers a resonant answer to "how do we endure loss?" through prior particulars (the mother’s hush, the drum’s silence), earning its emotional aftereffect without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("breathing inside fossilized honey," "tides were minutes"), with rhythm modulating under pressure—lyrical cadences compress as the fort hums. No head-hopping; the oracle’s lexicon stays consistent, though "mildly obsessed" risks label-speak without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but avoids overwriting: metaphors ("flag snapped like a bone") serve momentum, and sentence rhythm varies to mirror tension. Minor scaffold appears in "she felt the storm-tossed ridge fort begin to hum," slightly dulling immediacy, but no loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms oracle tropes through granular specificity: mapping "forgotten names" as reefs and silence as ink. Risk-taking (fort becoming a paper cutout) heightens stakes coherently, though the "stewardship" resolution leans slightly safe without deeper moral ambiguity in the cost.</comment>
