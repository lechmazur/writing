<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ghost drifting" vs "boldly sympathetic") manifests in micro-choices: Emil stepping aside for her discovery, teaching weaving instead of solo searching. No therapy-speak; "luminescent ache" embodies emotion concretely. Flaw: "boldly sympathetic" stated once without deeper exploration of its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: tag dissolves leaving palm scar while group becomes caretakers, reconfiguring kinship as enacted vow. Accumulative lens holds through 13 dawns' density build. Cost legible in "faint scar shaped like an open gate" and dissolved tag—conceptual price of belonging as process, not object.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard constrains every choice (dawn timing for light refraction) and charges closure: dissolved tag's light casts "moving tattoos" on faces. Micro-setting triumph—obsidian arbor's thinness enables the refracted tag discovery. Only flaw: "shimmering crater" lacks causal pressure beyond atmospheric framing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (belonging) tightens through accumulating group size (2→37 people) and shifting tactics from "looking" to "listening." Cost undeniable in tag's dissolution—physical proof vanishes but leaves scar and transformed community. Escalation driven by Lira's agency: teaching weaving, accepting Emil's gesture. Minor flaw: no visible cost during search buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reprises: reed-heart tag dissolving into communal scar, sprouting seeds showing "hands clasped." Final image ("laughter refracted into colors that spell...") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "webs of kinship" in physical acts (weaving arbors, palm scar).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers smelling of peat," "orchard’s chime shifted into minor key that lingered in their ribs"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during tag discovery ("Instead of announcing... silently stepped aside"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure's ellipsis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("frost and their own fogged breath" implies failed search while charging atmosphere). Figurative language precise: "lattice of volcanic glass so thin that starlight passed through it like breath through teeth" serves setting and theme. Final line’s ellipsis perfect closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "found object" trope through ecological specificity: obsidian arbor requires refracted light, reed-heart tag dissolves into communal scar. Fresh synthesis of artistry and belonging avoids abstraction—kinship enacted via weaving, sprouting seeds showing hands. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
