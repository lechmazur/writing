<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via worry stone ritual versus cosmic purpose, but "hopeful melancholy" label violates embodied emotion rule in climax, triggering -0.5 deduction despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "carrying correlated silence" crystallizes transformed stakes with conceptual cost, though temporal urgency ("before next phase") lacks precise tracking to fully charge final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains correlation method and charges final image ("stone's dent a perfect fit"), but sensory selection over-relies on visual during high-pressure moments, missing tactile urgency of electromagnetic field.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile's meaning) tightens through protagonist's intellectual agency in correlating silence, but "before next phase" timeframe remains vague rather than a live clock altering tactics, losing escalation precision under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess/cosmic metaphors ("eclipsed covenant as hidden sacrifice") with no moralizing; final "dance of consequence" image reweights "beauty in difficulty" without stating thesis, avoiding thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translating silence into notation") shines, but filter verbs + "hopeful melancholy" label in climax violate embodied emotion rule, creating voice leakage that dulls pressure despite rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats with high density, but "hopeful melancholy" repetition creates paraphrase loop across closure beats (-0.3), and passive construction ("silence spoke") slightly dulls propulsion during critical correlation moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy/cosmic forces transforms exile trope; "eclipsed covenant as chess position" shows non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though worry stone dent borders on familiar motif.</comment>
