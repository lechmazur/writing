<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kit’s contradictory impulses (jokes as armor vs. grief) manifest physically in rust-brushed knees and logbook handoffs; Lila’s moon-tax punchline crystallizes reciprocity as embodied action, not theme. Final choice to leave—motivated by "when the story changes"—carries felt cost in the weeping mayor’s hug.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Kit’s departure crystallizes the station’s new permanence ("polite to the last") with conceptual cost—his necessary exit proves the cure works. Accumulative lens holds; ivy’s Latin spells and doubling moon rock tighten stakes via patterned escalation, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy-choked clock and turquoise paint flakes constrain choices (Kit plants seeds in warped rails; Lila’s telegram specifies "hoarding nightlight"). Final image—leaves waving "promising loneliness kept in lost-property"—charges the recurring clock with irreversible transformation, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Loneliness measured in "grams" on the ticket booth evolves from metaphor to tangible stake; Kit’s departure (foreclosing his stay) reweights reciprocity as active surrender. Escalation via density—rumor chains multiplying pilgrims—drives deepening under Accumulative lens with cost visible in the mayor’s weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through moon rock’s doubling ("reciprocity starts with multiplication") and the station’s "lost-property" promise—no moralizing, just resonant image reconfiguring solitude as shared currency. Final line’s "laugh backward into time" reweights 11:47’s frozen face without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("voice cracking like old paint," "echo... sounded like passengers clapping") filters all details through Kit’s logistical pragmatism and grief. Lila’s dialogue ("hoarding nightlight") carries subtext-laden goal pursuit, distinct from Kit’s jocular armor; tense/stage shifts serve emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances texture ("aluminum deserves promotion" reframes ration tins as chesspieces). Final image’s "leaves waving" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure—prose density peaks in "silver-leafed saplings that chimed," proving propulsion without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms railway trope via reciprocity’s operational logic: moon rock’s multiplication isn’t magic but "recipe" requiring human action. Fresh inflection in loneliness measured in "grams," with emotional specificity (Kit’s "pallets of hope" failing against drowned loneliness) avoiding genericity.</comment>
