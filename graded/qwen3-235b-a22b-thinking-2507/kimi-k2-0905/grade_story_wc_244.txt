<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila's "desperately jocular" trait manifests concretely in the knock-knock exchange, but the "hollow inside her chest" leans toward label-only emotion rather than embodied contradiction. The reciprocity constraint creates meaningful pressure, yet the boy remains underdeveloped as symbol over character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock lurching forward crystallizes the cost of "hollow inside her chest fill[ing] with something like arriving trains." Orientation is flawless from "ivy-choked clock above platform three," and the Accumulative lens holds without contradiction through the catalytic laughter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The moon rock functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (reciprocity rule) and charges the closure—"shared orbit" reweights the final image. Station details like "timetables peeling from walls" evolve causally with the clock's movement, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: the "metallic, like moon rock" line crystallizes loneliness's cost, while the reciprocity constraint narrows options to finding a partner. Protagonist agency drives the catalysis choice, with visible cost in Lila's "hollow" filling and the boy's softened shoulders.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—"owe each other nothing quantifiable yet everything measurable in decibels of heart" offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; the "Otto be continued!" punchline reweights loneliness as ongoing reciprocity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lila's perceptual signature shines: "silk the color of overdue dawn," "whistling 'Hello, Dolly' in a minor key." Rhythmic control peaks in the joke sequence, with no head-hopping. Voice modulates perfectly from "weary grin" to the spectral train's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "ivy vines shivered; the station clock lurched" avoids loops. Minor overwriting in "tasting chalk, static, and faint sweetness" slightly dilutes the catalysis beat, but final line "paid in laughter, no change given" delivers zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms loneliness trope: moon rock as oxytocin catalyst via knock-knock jokes. "Polite anarchy" concept heightens stakes coherently, with the "Terminus of the Almost" reveal feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
