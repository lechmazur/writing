<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority crystallized through embodied choices (placing sundial, erasing need for others), though archivist's role remains underdeveloped. Contradictory impulses in "Do you choose company or self?" earn the solitude pivot with visceral cost in "each hoof-fall erasing the need."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "erasing the need for another quagga" legibly forecloses communal existence. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density (hum intensifying, shadow crawling) tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal library actively pressures action ("no exits, only tides"), while brass sundial’s shadow constrains time perception. Final cloud-belly image charges closure by transforming setting into propulsion ("hooves sparking static that drew migrating constellations").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. community) escalates through accumulative density—hum’s rising intensity, shadow’s millimeter=year crawl. Agency culminates in henge choice where solitude trades memory for momentum, with cost made visceral in hoof-fall erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Solitude equals momentum" emerges through action, not statement. Final prairie image ("sang, not with missing voices but...") offers resonant non-literal answer to extinction, reweighting loss as uncharted-era herald without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("salt-stiff scrolls," "gill-feathered archivist") remains distinct under pressure. Syntax modulates perfectly: staccato during fall ("The fall felt shorter than forgetting"), lyrical during transformation ("photosynthesize independence"). Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless—"brittle awakening... crack apart like drought-dried clay" avoids scaffold. One borderline phrase ("hooves sparking static that drew migrating constellations. They asked...") risks simultaneity but justified by rhythmic intent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quagga extinction reframed as rebirth ("her own dawn") synthesizes biological specificity with universal stakes. "Photosynthesize independence" exemplifies fresh inflection growing from prior particulars, avoiding derivative tropes through verifiable detail.</comment>
