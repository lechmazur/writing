<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (blithe gardener vs. keeper of heavy history) through embodied choices like digging at the lamb not her family mound; micro-decisions under pressure reveal hierarchy of values but flaw struggle feels muted during decoding climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sealing the silo door crystallizes irreversible commitment to memory's burden with conceptual cost ("no longer merely the blithe gardener"); Accumulative lens holds through bell-toll cadence tightening pressure toward excavation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (ladder access, sheltering seedlings) and charges final image (sealing mechanism); sovereign case's exact diameter matters for the tin door, making object indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mercy's decoding agency under time pressure (church bells marking hours), narrowing options until her choice to dig at the lamb—rejecting expected path—forecloses surface life with felt cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seed packets labeled "hope, defiance, return" rather than statement; final image of untangling seeds for "the next wanderer" resonates non-literally as memory's continuity, avoiding sentimentality while charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," noticing tool organization) modulates under pressure with rhythmic shifts ("She pockets the sovereign, sets her chess clock to infinite"); no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "tarnished coin etched with a spiral" simultaneously advances plot, character, and theme; metaphors coherent ("echoes flutter through her ribs") without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "hidden cellar" trope through specific seeds as "intentions," avoiding generic resistance narratives; emotional truth in quiet acceptance of burden heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
