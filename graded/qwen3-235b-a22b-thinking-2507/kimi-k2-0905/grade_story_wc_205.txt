<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aurelio's bloodletting and poetic futility, but Mira's motivation lacks sufficient friction; her "stunned reverence" doesn't fully earn the pivotal mirror decision. Emotional progression avoids therapy-speak yet edges toward over-tidiness in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the shivering mirror's suspended history and cost in the "fissures branching like frost." Lens ambiguity early (is this causal or accumulative?) slightly weakens midpoint causality, though the storm's escalation tightens pressure coherently under Accumulative/Textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal shard constrains choice (bloodletting, inscription) and charges the final image as a "constellation of selves." "Liquid brass" time drips and vacuum-bleeding cathedrals transform setting into active pressure—micro-setting essentiality elevates beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the mirror reveals Mnemosyne's future collapse, forcing Aurelio's inscription as a trade-off between despair and legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the guild dispute's resolution lacks felt consequence beyond the central pair's epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard's evolution from wound-tool to inscription instrument, avoiding moralizing. The glowing, rearranging line "Civilizations fall; the poem remains" offers resonant non-literal answer to "who controls history?" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("burnished sorrow," "molten pewter") is Aurelio's poetic lens made visceral. Rhythmic control under pressure—fragmented clauses during the storm—"whispered a stanza" compression—avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; single-POV mastery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ribbons of chronal lightning braiding nooses" achieves high density without muddle. Final line's fragmentation ("rewriting") serves purposeful compression. One borderline purple phrase ("gilded coffin") barely avoids overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-as-physical-concept beyond cliché: "ticking dust" and "luminous sand" ground abstraction in tactile stakes. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens meaning without gimmickry—the cosmic insignificance of revolutions feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
