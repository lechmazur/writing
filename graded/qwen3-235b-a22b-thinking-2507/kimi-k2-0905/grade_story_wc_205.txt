<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (covering mirrors while humming), but "voice burnished by regret" edges toward diagnostic phrasing. Contradictory impulses (revolutionary past vs. poetic reimagining) lack sufficient friction during key decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: crushing the shard births a new civilization with visible cost (Aurelia's dissolution). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds through mirror-covering sequence until the shard's destruction reweights revolution's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: obsidian walls pulse time, velvet drapes become tactical tools, and the crystal shard charges the final image. "Ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood" exemplifies sensory specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when archaeologist breaches the palace, forcing Aurelia's final choice. But the dispute's escalation feels external—threats echo as "encrypted static" without altering her tactics until the climax, missing one escalation beat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Mirrorless, we become the reflection we sought" crystallizes theme without moralizing. Final image ("sorrow... bright enough to read by") reweights revolution's failure as luminous possibility, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars like fountains of unsent letters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: time "soaked in blood," sorrow "tucked into bed." Archaeologist's generic dialogue ("Drop the artifact") slightly dilutes voice distinction, but Aurelia's poetic cadence modulates perfectly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "yesterday's fist raised beside today's trembling hand" creates a paraphrase loop with subsequent temporal imagery. Final line achieves crystalline clarity ("sorrow... bright enough to read by") redeeming minor mid-story redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms revolution tropes through poetic mechanics: revolutionaries don't seize power but "reimagine boulevards." The crystal shard storing "forgotten anthems" synthesizes political and artistic legacy with emotional specificity, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
