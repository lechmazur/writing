<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in chasing dissolving hush; micro-choices like reading mattress manuscript reveal values under pressure. Father's ghost lacks sufficient embodied conflict, slightly weakening the relationship crucible despite strong final exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("carcass wore the skin of parable"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens throughout. "Before they find bodies" timeframe lacks active pressure during escalation, missing one escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (impossible stairs, rotating lens) and charges final image. "Gull blood" detail feels slightly decorative but coral metaphor powerfully sustains the dominant stake through closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as hush thickens into fog, with Cassian's final step creating irreversible change. Keepers' threat ("before they find bodies") remains abstract pressure without altering mid-scene tactics, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "wolf made of withheld truth" and lattice grinding lies into beams. Final sentence reweights inheritance without moralizing, though "carcass wore skin of parable" flirts with abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hush darted ahead, a silver minnow of silence"; rhythmic control intensifies during stair climb. Slight register drift in "repentant parishioner" simile, but elision patterns are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copperlight repose" recurrence deepens meaning without redundancy. Figurative language serves propulsion ("boots printing salt across flags"), though "gull blood" smell feels marginally forced in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms cry-wolf myth through "wolf of withheld truth" and lighthouse-as-coral metaphor. Risk-taking with impossible physics heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing tropes into singular vision where every detail serves the closure.</comment>
