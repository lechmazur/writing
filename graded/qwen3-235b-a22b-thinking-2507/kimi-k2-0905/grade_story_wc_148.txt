<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's inherited "cry wolf" trauma drives every choice; "voice cracking" confession shows embodied contradiction. Final endurance ("I forgive silence but won't become it") earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation clear by l.30; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation. Closure lands as Charged Poise when grass reveals path, cost legible in "ground remember[ing] weight without complaint" after scuffs erased.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison micro-setting constrains choice (scuffs smoothing steps); copperlight repose evolves from "dried blood" to self-sustaining dawn, charging final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Silas's agency: speaking to walls narrows options, mirror ascent deepens knowledge. Cost crystallizes when reef vanishes, reweighting "hush" from silence to music with felt relational loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "hush" transformation; "I forgive silence but won't become it" earns resonance without moralizing. Final grass path reweights cry-wolf legacy into generative motion, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "tide gnawed back," "liquid pane." Under stress, syntax compresses ("He knelt, lattice across knees"). No POV slippage; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "iron vines bloomed into small bells" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "copper dusk settling... like a verdict" bordering on overwrought in peak pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "cry wolf" via visceral prison imagery; copperlight repose as both color and state feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, following implications to earned rebirth.</comment>
