<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lina’s embodied contradiction—terror enabling altitude, crystallized breath pricking lungs—drives micro-choices (quill pressure, held breath) with visceral cost. Brother’s fall isn’t backstory but active constraint shaping the twelfth stroke; no diagnostic labels, only sensory truth like "iron" taste of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: scars becoming stories forecloses Lina’s trapped breath path with visible cost (split quill, rock drifting higher). Accumulative lens holds—typhoon’s arrival crystallizes pressure into motes reconfiguring memory, no causality breaks. Cost proof: "shards of memory into a word she could speak without bleeding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock platform (micro-setting) constrains choice—no railing makes trust/terror visceral. Final image charged by rock drifting higher as "relieved of weight," directly reweighting the opening’s "drifted three inches." Tatami mats and kettle evolve from static to soaked tools, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (rewriting grief vs. lethal breath) tighten through Lina’s agency: holding breath past crystallization for the twelfth stroke. Escalation via Accumulative lens—steam plume thickening, lightning strike—narrows options to the final stroke. Cost is legible: quill fracture, brother’s name spoken "lighter than the last" into the storm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "crystallized breath" becoming "luminous sentences," quill split as "story torn from the world." Final image—"scars had become stories, and stories, unlike bodies, know how to fly"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through the rock’s ascent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp under stress: "storm clouds stacked like bruised shelves," breath crystallizing into "minute needles." Voice modulates from taut precision (rune-drawing) to fragmented relief ("bitter leaves and lake-cold wind"). Zero head-hopping; Master Jomei’s minimal dialogue ("tell it who you are") distinct in rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line propulsion flawless except near-overwriting in "squid-ink mixed with powdered jade" (ornamental, not pressure-driving). Zero loops, but "pearl of steam began to unfurl" edges toward lyrical excess. Final line’s "stories... know how to fly" earns density with closure charge, avoiding scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "tea ceremony" trope through lethal stakes (breath crystallization) and grief mechanics. Emotional specificity in "crystallized shards of memory" avoids generic trauma. Risk-taking (floating rock as pressure chamber) heightens stakes coherently; quill fracture as "lightning bolt" feels inevitable.</comment>
