<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation for capturing the dream is clear and fierce, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction during climax; "hollowed by absence" remains abstract rather than revealing conflicting impulses in the decisive tide-step moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with the coral shelves pulsing longing, but cost proof falters—film vanishing lacks tangible consequence, and "airy saturation" obscures felt sacrifice despite skin-spelled cipher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago actively pressures choices: tide tongues release hush like pulse, movable horizon risks unnamed memories, coral shelves charge the final image by containing painted colors and cipher syllables.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mireya steps into tide to paint a golden corridor, narrowing options to a single decisive frame—but escalation relies on atmospheric density rather than tactical cost, weakening the "fair bargain" trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the final image of shelves holding "luminous absence" reweights longing without moralizing, though "restore voices" early hints at slight thematic echo before earned resonance crystallizes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("palette no wider than a sandpiper’s wing"), rhythmic control intensifies during climax ("shutter’s click echoing like a match struck"), and elision of erased voices teaches its pattern by 25% for mosaic coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "neon seaweed" metaphor sustains clarity under pressure. Minor deduction for "luminous absence" repeating without evolving texture in high-stakes beats, approaching synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms librarian trope through "shelving silence" and light-painting—story logic would collapse without coral shelves as both setting and closure engine, synthesizing longing into tangible pulse rather than abstract theme.</comment>
