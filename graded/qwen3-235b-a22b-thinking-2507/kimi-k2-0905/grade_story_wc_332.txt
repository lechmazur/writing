<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "hollowed by absence" borders on abstraction but redeemed by embodied choices like stepping into the tide. Final transformation into "the gap between heartbeats" earns visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: coral shelves pulsing with "coherent longing" while voices return charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative) holds from first sentence to last.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago actively constrains choices: tide tongues release hush when stepping, movable horizon risks memory trade. Coral shelves humming for missed things directly charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mireya's agency: painting light corridor, stepping into tide. Cost unmistakable (palette cracks, colors rush through veins), though horizon's "memory trade" risk lacks visceral payoff before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "luminous absence now brimming" reweights longing without moralizing. Final line ("whispering impossible beginnings without forgetting endings") delivers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "pulse trying to pronounce someone’s hidden name." Rhythmic control under pressure ("sky bled indigo, then vermilion") avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light imploded into the lens" does triple duty as action/image/theme. Only microscopic flaw: "coherent longing" slightly abstracts where concrete detail would strengthen final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms librarian trope through specific mechanics: shelving silence, coral shelves humming for missed things. "Cipher of longing" avoids abstraction by manifesting in the dream's burning paper boat glyph.</comment>
