<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "against the current of her cynicism" as Mara chooses release over hoarding; embodied emotion via "throat closed" when confronted by Lira avoids abstraction; micro-choices like offering the shell earn the renunciation with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "pockets empty except for the echo" crystallizes the conceptual cost of Mara's choice under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors instantly at "feral nexus"; no causality breaks weaken the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The seashell fragment evolves from ear trumpet to lighthouse, constraining choices (collecting hopes) and charging the final image; mist as micro-setting actively shapes tactics via "quotation marks" choreography and "salt and wet paper" sensory pressure on every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lira accuses "You left me mid-knock," forcing Mara's agency to return the shell; the cost—"pockets empty"—is viscerally felt under Accumulative lens as pressure accumulates through ephemeral encounters toward the renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the seashell's transformation: "collecting hopes was not hoarding but releasing" reframes the central question without moralizing; the lighthouse image resonates as a charged answer to artistic cowardice, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mist tasted of salt and wet paper") and rhythmic control ("swirling hush deepened") heighten pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure; no head-hopping in single-POV despite dense interiority under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "clung to her eyelashes like marginalia" exemplifies textural specificity doing triple duty; sentence rhythm accelerates during Lira's confrontation then breathes at "dawn the color of unread proofs," with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms writer's-block tropes through the seashell's evolution and "hopes as angular" motif; risks lyrical structure yet maintains causal coherence, with "feral nexus" specificity creating freshness without gimmickry; emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
