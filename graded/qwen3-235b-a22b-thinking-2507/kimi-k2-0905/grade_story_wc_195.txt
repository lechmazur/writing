<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "knelt because knights do not weep standing" and micro-choices like pressing program to soil, but abstract reflections slightly dilute embodied emotion during fusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands flawlessly with conceptual cost (deserted men's names on visor), though the murmured allegiance beat feels marginally disconnected from the escalation chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice (spiral path, mercury roots) and charges closure via black-wood shoots; "breathing soil" evolves causally to rewrite the program.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through three reality shifts with visible cost (visor frost spelling deserters' names), each narrowing options under accumulative pressure toward the seed-planting covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "space between who I was carved to be and what I might yet grow," avoiding moralizing; final seed-planting reweights failure as compost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("thrum of unseen fruit," "copper and starlight") modulates perfectly under pressure, though "orchards blooming inside his ribs" edges toward overwriting without full integration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moth wings bearing blueprint" exemplifies high-density imagery, with only "sleeping lungs" slightly flirting with cliché before earning its weight through mercury-root payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms knight trope through alchemical horticulture; "shivering bliss" of being seen feels emotionally specific, with risk-taking (non-causal structure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
