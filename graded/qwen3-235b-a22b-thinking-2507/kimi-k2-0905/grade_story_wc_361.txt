<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("jittery hands," "heart performed its familiar jittery waltz") grounds Elias's transformation. Contradictory impulses (fear/anticipation) drive his final choice to "step beyond teaching," though "wound that refused to scar" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: aurora's intensification and pendant's vibration deepen stakes until Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in "jittery nature transform[ing] into something that trembled not with fear"—a visible reconfiguration of identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway functions as active micro-setting, constraining choice by being "a seam where reality grew thin." Final image ("ridgeway continued its eternal dance") charges closure by reweighting the path from courier route to mythic bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: "world that preferred certainty to mystery" vs. coaxing wonder. Elias's agency in releasing the pendant forecloses ordinary existence, with cost legible in "weight of becoming"—a transformation narrowing options through internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("germinate wonder," "fade from memory to myth"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("wonder grows best when planted in the fertile soil between what was and what might yet be") reweights the premise without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid sky," "barnacles on a ship's hull") modulates rhythm under pressure. Single-POV stability shines in "dragonfly wings scattering into the aurora's dance"—lyrical compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero paraphrase loops; "aurora's dance" repetition evolves meaning purposefully. Minor deduction for "jittery" appearing 4x (0.1), though abstract phrasing like "weight of becoming" risks dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: "courier must become the message" feels inevitable via pendant mechanics and ridgeway's thin reality. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
