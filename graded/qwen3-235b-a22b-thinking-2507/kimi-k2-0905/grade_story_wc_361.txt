<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's embodied "jittery" nature transforms credibly into "weight of becoming," with micro-choices like pendant clutching revealing hierarchy of values. Lacks visible cost in final transformation; change feels passive rather than earned by specific tactical alteration under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias steps into legend, with conceptual cost in "memory fades and myth germinates." Orientation solid (ridgeway/aurora established by para 1), but "courier must become message" exposition slightly dilutes earned causality in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway actively constrains choice (path narrowing) and charges final image ("aurora seemed to reach down and claim him"). Micro-setting of pendant vibration directly shapes tactics across beats, satisfying 9+ gate requirement for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens via pendant's vibration, but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs; cost remains abstract (loss of ordinary identity) rather than viscerally felt through concrete forfeiture or tactical shift under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "germinate wonder from routine" motif, culminating in resonant final image of aurora "dancing" as fertile soil for legend. Zero thematic echo; insight earned through Elias's tactile relic-carrying journey rather than abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "aurora dripping light" and "air thick as honey," with rhythmic control deepening under pressure ("dragonfly wings scattering into aurora's dance"). No head-hopping; single-POV compression taught early and paid off in transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-synonym churn in "sympathetic vibration" repetitions (3x with minor variations) creates subtle scaffold. "Germinate" overuse (4x) risks thematic echo, but high density and lyrical propulsion prevent momentum loss in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mentor trope through specific mechanics (vibrating pendant as mythic conduit) and avoids generic fantasy via tactile details like "dragonfly filigree catching fragments of light." Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, but emotional specificity slightly constrained by abstract cost.</comment>
