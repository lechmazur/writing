<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in breath sync ritual; blood sacrifice embodies cost without diagnostic labels. Final choice earned by prior causality but mother's influence slightly flattens flaw depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (blood sacrifice, orchard rebirth). Accumulative lens holds through frost-breath rhythm; "centuries-long sleep" exhale crystallizes irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost constrains timing (pulse matching gears), sextant's jagged edge charges final image. "Moldy apples/forgotten blossoms" sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency of recapture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist's agency: blood sacrifice narrows options from observation to visceral integration. Cost legible in palm wound but secondary "glass mountains" stake slightly diffuses focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final sapling mirrors reconfigure "erasing boundaries" theme without moralizing. "Breathe them into new forms" resonates as earned wisdom from blood ritual, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silver breath," "ghostly petals") reflects mirror maker's craft. Rhythmic control in sync counts modulates under pressure; no head-hopping in single-POV lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "soldered itself whole" shows rather than tells repair. Near-miss: "aurora of childhood laughter" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete "mother's hands shaping molten glass" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "glass mountains" solitude myth with orchard ecology. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though fog-as-memory trope edges toward familiarity without sufficient transformation.</comment>
