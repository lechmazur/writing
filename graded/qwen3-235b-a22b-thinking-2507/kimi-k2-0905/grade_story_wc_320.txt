<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through discarding assumptions as ballast; embodied emotion ("tears blurred the dials") avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to "return" earns closure with visible cost: "coat lighter by one sequin and one lifetime of conclusions." No stock phrasing in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: shard transforms from threat to "cocoon" with undeniable cost ("lifetime of conclusions" dissolved). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via sensory density ("dust motes in slow-motion waltzes"), not causal turns. Cost proof: "palms open, understanding... to return."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hollywood star fragment (micro-setting) constrains choices: discarding assumptions makes it "glow warmer," enabling tuning. Charges final image ("coat lighter by one sequin") and closure ("language older than silence"). Tower 7’s swaying girders physically manifest tension—no generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: discarding assumptions narrows options (rejecting "silence is absence"). Cost unmistakable—fragment’s sublimation sacrifices "arrogance of human fame" for cosmic rebirth. Single deepening ("shard is a cocoon") reweights dominant stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: tuning dissolves conclusions to reveal silence as "protected origin." Final image ("counting rusted steps as first word") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in vacuum tubes and static.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "antennas humming like crickets that learned grammar." Rhythmic control under pressure ("serenely electric pins mapping constellations") avoids head-hopping. Lexicon stays character-bound: "sailors ditch ballast" mirrors her technical grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops—every sentence advances atmosphere ("dust motes in slow-motion waltzes"). Figurative language in high-pressure beats ("shard slid like a cat to a hearth") is pattern-taught and payoff-driven. Final line’s cadence avoids purple prose through concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "silence as threat" trope via shard of hush concept. Hollywood star fragment as tuning filament feels inevitable, not checklist. Risk-taking (lyric density at 700 words) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—proves emotional truth over surface novelty.</comment>
