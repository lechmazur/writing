<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in discarding assumptions while clinging to the star fragment; embodied cost crystallizes when sequin sublimates into "sunrise bottled," making renunciation viscerally felt without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: shard dissolving into "needle finding the groove" reconfigures silence as rebirth with exact cost ("coat lighter by one sequin and one lifetime of conclusions") under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (star fragment as filament) charges closure, but gorge/towers remain atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; lunar pull tightens tension yet lacks tactical impact on tuning act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency—discarding assumptions narrows options visibly as fragment glows warmer; cost is unmistakable when sequin sublimation sacrifices "one lifetime of conclusions" to feed the circuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shard of hush" transformation: "every finale a hinge" realization reweights endings as tape loops without moralizing; final image ("language older than silence") answers cosmic question through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "serenely electric pins mapping constellations across her skin"; rhythmic control shifts from staccato urgency ("She unscrewed the hatch") to lyrical payoff ("gorges whispering upward") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold—every line propels ("antennas humming like crickets that learned grammar"); slight density dip in "serenely electric vacancy" redeemed by immediate concrete payoff ("dimmed bulbs and calmed hearts").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms radio-tower trope via cosmic silence-as-cocoon; "shard of hush" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with "lunar light pooling like mercury" offering verifiable freshness beyond genre clichés.</comment>
