<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her dual role as savior and abandoner; the puppet's forgiveness vision earns her renunciation with visceral cost ("body eroding like sandstone"). Slight underdevelopment of internal struggle during lullaby iterations holds back a 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her eternal whispering forecloses escape with undeniable cost ("eroding like sandstone into salt"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each lullaby recursion tightens pressure without causality breaks. Cost proof crystallized in that single erosion image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The puppet head (tool) and throat (body) charge the final image as she becomes "the pane’s silvered backing." Lighthouse’s nested railings constrain choice by mirroring the recursion method. Dusk atmosphere slightly underutilized compared to other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by her agency: each whispered lullaby iteration deepens the hush, narrowing options until the renunciation. Cost is unmistakable in the erosion imagery. Secondary stake (puppet’s forgiveness) slightly underserved in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "imperfection was the only song worth singing" reweights the cracked puppet smile into mercy. Final "ghost mirror" image answers the central question without moralizing. Zero thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—she notices textures (matte glass, splintered wood) under stress. Rhythmic compression during climax ("Midnight shuddered...") heightens pressure. Minor deduction for slight sentence-opening repetition in the recursion sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; peak beats like "throat cracked" achieve brutal density without muddle. "Veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled" layers meaning flawlessly. Final line’s repetition ("I am here") earns its weight through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lullabies as clock-stopping mechanism via nested recursion. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without obscurity. "Doomsday clock" premise slightly familiar but transformed by drowned-cradle specificity.</comment>
