<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "telling the gallery owner... telling herself... telling the porcelain fragments," but grandmother's absence limits relationship depth. Micro-choices like mask adjustment reveal hierarchy of values, though some motivation remains opaque beyond grief ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "each grain a moment her grandmother had held back" crystallizes irreversible loss. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—powder scattering deepens the stake without causal turns, reweighting safety as "mirage" through physical action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gallery's vanishing point actively constrains the installation's sight lines and meaning, while porcelain powder charges the final image. Near-miss: "crystallized tears" simile slightly over-ornaments grief, but rocking chair's "whispered" motion shows lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elena's agency: scattering powder transforms "incomplete information" into physical spiral with felt cost. One deepening suffices—powder's shift from material to memory-path reweights safety's illusion, though the grandmother's mid-sentence death backstory slightly softens present pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through powder's transformation, but "safety is always a mirage" risks thematic echo. Saved by immediate physicality: "love is the powder we scatter" gains resonance from prior grinding of porcelain, avoiding abstraction despite borderline final-paragraph statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Elena's artist-eye filters light through porcelain shards and charcoal stains. Rhythmic control under pressure ("rocking motion transformed from habit into memory") modulates voice without head-hopping, though late backstory risks reflection-led drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "crystallized tears" and "halo effect" verge on overwriting in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops, yet "powder and scattered across three states" slightly muddles causality—costs only 0.2 deduction for density in peak grief moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming gallery physics into emotional calculus: vanishing point as convergence of memory and loss. Risk-taking (textural accumulation over causality) heightens stakes, though porcelain-as-metaphor borders on familiar—but "powdered safety" twist feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
