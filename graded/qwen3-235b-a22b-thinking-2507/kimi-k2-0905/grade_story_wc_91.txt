<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (philanthropy vs destitution) and embodied emotion (sand, glass warmth) shine, but Lira’s function as thematic mirror lacks distinct micro-choices; "texture" epiphany edges toward unearned abstraction despite tactile framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (destitution redefined as currency), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through eclipse-bug-cave resonance; prophecy feels slightly convenient but redeemed by lava staircase’s earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic glass setting actively constrains choices (path creation, cave entry) and charges the final image (seedlings→orchids); obsidian shards and fire-resistant orchids demonstrate micro-setting necessity with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (purpose vs silence) tighten through lava eruption and cave immersion, but "texture" motivation lacks concrete prior friction; cost (redefined destitution) is legible yet feels conceptual rather than visceral under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from glass/orchid motifs reweighted at closure ("currency" of transformation), avoiding moralizing; final line’s "silence learning to glow" offers resonant non-literal answer, though "texture" risks over-abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geological/tactile lexicon: "obsidian grains," "viscous glow") and rhythmic control under pressure; no dialogue to test voice distinction, but single-POV consistency and lyrical compression remain purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops but occasional figurative muddle ("bottled constellations," "vibrant hush" repetition); high density falters in prophecy line ("fulfilling prophecies accidentally etched") with cadence drag, though final image propulsion recovers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of volcanic transformation with philanthropy’s paradox feels inevitable; risk-taking (Accumulative lens, non-causal closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though eclipse-bug mechanics slightly edge toward symbolic convenience.</comment>
