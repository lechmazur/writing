<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between poverty and purpose is embodied in volcanic glass heat and firefly memories, but the epiphany lacks concrete struggle; "transformation requires surrender" borders on thematic echo without sufficient prior friction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: the mirror beach reconfigures poverty's meaning with felt cost ("ultimate gift"), though escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than causal narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic glass constrains choice (kneeling on heat) and charges closure as reflective mirror; obsidian grains' texture evolution from liquid fire to supportive ground embodies transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through fireflies synchronizing with volcano's heartbeat, reweighting surrender as agency; cost ("poverty revealed as ultimate gift") is legible but lacks tangible tactical shift beyond internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fireflies' memory-release as non-literal answer to transformation; avoids moralizing by showing poverty's emptiness as vessel for abundance in final mirror image without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("obsidian grains," "amber light"), but volcanic glass heat description repeats "heat" conceptually across beats, slightly diluting pressure in high-stakes release sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line propulsion stumbles in climax with stacked metaphors ("galaxy had fallen to earth," "skeleton of light"); near-simultaneous "dissolving" and "vibrant hush" images create minor coherence drift without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destitution as transformative emptiness avoids poverty tropes; cosmic scale grounds in tactile volcanic details, though celestial dance risks derivative "chosen one" framing without sufficient counterbalance.</comment>
