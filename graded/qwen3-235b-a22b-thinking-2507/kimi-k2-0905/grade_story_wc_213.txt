<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority avoids stock phrasing; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. listening) manifest in concrete micro-choices like tying the bell rope. The earned renunciation—prioritizing the mountain’s voice over protocol—carries visible cost through the unauthorized act, though "credibly curious" risks label-like phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the bell’s toll reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (defying civic ritual for ecological truth), under an Accumulative/Textural lens where pressure builds via sensory density. Orientation anchors ("windblown sanctuary," "solstice hush") establish setting by line 3 without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bell rope functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara’s choice (tying it to the servo arm) and charging the final image ("released the rope, heart drumming"). Environmental pressure is tactile—barometer trembling, wind shifting 30 degrees—evolving causally with microclimate anomalies to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: pressure dips at 03:17/03:42 narrow options, forcing Mara’s switch decision. The cost—professional risk of "first unauthorized test"—is legible through her defiance, though the mountain’s "satisfaction" slightly softens consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly via action ("favor listening over noise" dramatized in bell choice), with the final "ghost of six low notes" offering resonant, non-literal closure. Avoids moralizing, but "courtesy" insight edges toward neatness without deeper counterweight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s perceptual signature shines ("ears cleansed by altitude," "electric scent"), with syntax modulating under stress (short phrases during pressure dips). "Credibly curious" slightly strains lexicon, but rhythmic control—e.g., "low notes rolling... like warm stones"—avoids ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("glue glowed dull silver... set hard as trust itself" merges action, metaphor, and character). Only minor deduction: "microclimate hiccup... fingerprint" risks adjacent paraphrase, but closure imagery ("ghost of six low notes") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: storm siren tester + cathedral bell reframes climate anxiety through tactile ritual. "Sky’s throat" metaphor and data-driven resonance (72 hertz) avoid cliché, though "humble" trait slightly echoes prompt safety. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring coherence.</comment>
