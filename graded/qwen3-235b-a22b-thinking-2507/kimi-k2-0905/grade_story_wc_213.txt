<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s "credibly curious" mind cataloging possibilities while trusting the mountain’s tug; her shift from data collection to "courtesy" earns via tactile choices (tying rope to servo) with felt cost in altered purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: bell tolls map the downdraft, then wind collapses "as if satisfied," crystallizing Mara’s realization with conceptual cost—tracking shifts from prediction to answering whispers, all under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s micro-setting (bell rope’s pine-tar scent, barometer’s trembling brass) constrains choices—Mara must climb to belfry—and charges the final image where citizens carry the "ghost of six low notes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via microclimate anomalies (pressure dips, wind shifts) under Accumulative lens; Mara’s agency in switching the toggle forecloses prediction for "courtesy," with cost legible in her altered stance: "she would listen."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: bell tolls "warm stones in cold milk" reweight "listening over noise" without moralizing; final image of citizens’ lingering "ghost" offers resonant answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise—"electric scent of alpine dawn," "brass face trembling"—with rhythmic control under pressure; no POV leakage as diction modulates from technical ("katabatic spill") to lyrical ("moon nailed to sky").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("clouds surged," "rope twitched"); figurative language ("warm stones in cold milk") clarifies pressure without muddle, even in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist vs. nature" trope through specific stakes—copper patches lowering pitch, barometer dips—as fresh inflection where microclimate tracking becomes "courtesy," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
