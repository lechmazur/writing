<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses act in scene (dealer needing real feeling) and her earned renunciation of detachment carries visible cost (“porous, aching affection for every soul she’d ever duped”). Chemist applies pressure through stillness, avoiding stock dynamics. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: her discarded armor and “let it hurt” crystallize the transformation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—emotional layers tighten stakes without causal turns. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in “proof she was still reachable.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Amber grotto actively constrains choices: fossilized sap traps confessions, static enables sensing, and cooling stone charges the final image. Micro-setting (vials in coat) alters the ending when one cracks. Final “electric hum of the earth” reweights the environment’s role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency (pressing petal to wrist) under Accumulative lens. Dominant stake (truth vs. protection) signaled immediately; cost is unmistakable as her empire’s foundation dissolves. Band guardrail met—the “porous affection” charges the final image with emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “insight without empathy was just surveillance” avoids moralizing. Final image (“pressed palm to ground... electric hum”) offers non-literal answer to “can empathy be bottled?” No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in “subsume” vs. erase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (“light itself seemed to hesitate”); rhythm modulates with tension (short phrases during transformation). Dialogue indirection (“You didn’t come here to sell”) pursues goals. Zero head-hopping; voice stays consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences do triple duty (“scent bloomed like a bruise” merges image/emotion/theme). No figurative muddle; final line’s fragmentation (“a beginning. And that was enough.”) achieves propulsion. “Static crackling in her hair” exemplifies textural density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfume chemistry and emotional trade: “blotter petal” absorbing “oils of unspoken confessions” transforms tropes. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids safety middle via specific cost (“watered down” hearts).</comment>
