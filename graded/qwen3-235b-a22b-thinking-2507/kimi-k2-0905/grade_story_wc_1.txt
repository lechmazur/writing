<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices: crushing charcoal becomes a visceral renunciation, not abstract epiphany. "Breath on cracked glass" motif perfectly embodies her adaptive resilience without therapy-speak. Only flaw: smugglers' schism feels slightly convenient, lacking concrete character contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis when she crushes the ledger—"charcoal line printing a ghost" crystallizes conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: frost patterns, bead trails, and obsidian shard accumulate toward dawn's reconfiguration. Orientation perfect within 20 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon setting constrains every choice: frozen sand dictates bead-dropping, schist warmth guides frost-reading, cliff faces narrow options. "Patterns in morning frost" isn't backdrop but active tool charging the final image where glass fragments "ignite into floating sparks." Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through tactile escalation: ledger flaking forces physical contact ("pressed it against her chest"), ash-circle schism reveals moral cost. Pressure tightens via environment (canyon narrowing to "blade of starlight") not plot mechanics. Missing one felt price during pivotal ash-circle discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects: charcoal line's fading ghost embodies "purpose in the pauses" without moralizing. Final image—"transparency without secrets"—reweights scorched testament as liberation, not evidence. No thematic echo; wisdom earned through obsidian shard's "edge singing against fingerprint."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: glass artist notices "delicate commas" in cart ruts, "braille-like ridges" in ink. Prose rhythm mirrors kiln heat ("air so cold it rang") then canyon constriction. Zero head-hopping; single-POV intensity sustains through lyrical compression ("dawn seeped down cliff faces like pale enamel").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion dazzles: "flames licking the rafters like wolves tasting blood" avoids cliché through concrete violence. Minor deduction for "drifting resonance" repetition (three beats) risking thematic echo, but saved by earned payoff in bus-tire "hum like a kiln." No scaffold or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms fugitive trope through material specificity: glass beads as "breadcrumbs of color," charcoal as skin-glaze. Risk-taking succeeds—lyric density never obscures causality. Slightly derivative "purpose in pauses" concept elevated by schist warmth and obsidian shard’s physical truth. No famous-line echoes.</comment>
