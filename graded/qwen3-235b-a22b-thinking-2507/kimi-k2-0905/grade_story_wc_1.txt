<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in glass-making metaphors ("breath on cracked glass") avoids diagnostic labels, but the dawn epiphany lacks sufficient struggle to fully earn the renunciation; micro-choices like pocketing obsidian reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"pause felt wide enough to live inside" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with visible cost (crushed ledger, fading charcoal line); orientation anchors canyon/stars by word 15, no ambiguity in drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choices (reading smugglers' path) and charges the final image (sparks guiding her out), but "schist warm from yesterday's sun" lacks causal pressure despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as "pauses" shift from survival tactic to philosophy, but the conceptual cost of destroyed ledger lacks visceral immediacy; agency in turning back forecloses the smuggler path with felt trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "shaping transparency without secrets" reweights the entire journey non-literally, avoiding moralizing; every detail serves the emergent theme of purpose in stillness without abstraction or balance toggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature as glass artist shines ("sky became a blade of starlight"), but dawn reflection uses elevated diction ("imploded campfire," "black sun") that clashes with fugitive POV, triggering register drift penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Masterful rhythm in opening ("kiln’s last exhale"), but ledger contradiction ("bubbled into braille-like ridges" vs. "letters drifting off like moths") violates physical logic; "drifting resonance" repetition lacks pattern teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fuses glass-making craft with espionage into inevitable synthesis—the "patterns in morning frost" methodology transforms a trope into fresh emotional truth; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
