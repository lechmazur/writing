<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete (counting 730 orbits, ink-scented grief), but "proof by contradiction" line risks thematic echo; micro-choices like splintering the nib earn closure despite minor over-articulation in final dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Conceptual Repricing ("Regret that cannot accommodate new truth is not orbit but cage") with undeniable cost (broken nib, gravity's absence); lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup, though journalist's role weakens cast coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: projector mechanics directly constrain choices (mirror adjustments, ink loading), and rosewood nib charges the final image; minor deduction for "solemn playroom for absent gods" feeling ornamental rather than pressure-driving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (each inscription deepens contradiction), narrowing options until the cage/reconfiguration; cost (shattered nib, transformed orbit) unmistakably legible on final page with aphelion's drift and inked sunrise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "headlines like cometary debris" evolving into migrating birds avoids moralizing; final image ("The story continues") reweights regret as planetary motion without stated moral, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (journalistic/astronomical lexicon: "perihelion above her head," "rewriting microfiche"); rhythmic control peaks in writing sequences ("She pushed further..."), though "devotedly observant" repetition slightly dilutes pressure in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through kinetic verbs ("dripped," "shuddered," "scattered"); only hairline flaw: "solemn playfulness" echo in Orlan's dialogue mildly dilutes peak-beat immediacy without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proof-by-contradiction as emotional tool transforms journalism tropes; risk-taking (orbiting regret as physical ellipse) heightens stakes coherently, with inked sunrise on window proving inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
