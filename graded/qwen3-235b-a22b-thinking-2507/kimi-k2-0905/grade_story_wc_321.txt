<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden’s "resiliently positive" trait manifests through humming, laughing at grotto walls, and steering via heartbeats—never labeled. Contradictory impulses (surrender vs. anchoring timelines) drive his final choice, but the cost of merging timelines lacks sufficient personalization beyond the hourglass disintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the hourglass crumbling into "frost that chose to stay" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("one timeline must be poured into the other"). Accumulative lens holds through pattern escalation (barnacle coordinates → radio heartbeats), though grotto closure feels slightly coincidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s phosphorescent barnacles directly constrain choice by providing steering coordinates, and the hourglass (micro-setting) charges the final image. Misses 9+ gate as no environment/tool visibly shapes Arden’s final bow moment beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively when Arden realizes merging requires choosing which timeline to sacrifice ("burning hope through his coat"). Agency shines in reversing the hourglass flow, but the cost leans slightly abstract—more visceral embodiment of "pouring" one timeline into another would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line ("ferry ride between what was and what still could be") offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting "permanent transient" from resignation to active navigation. Zero thematic echo; wisdom arises solely from Arden’s concrete struggle with the hourglass and commuters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "coordinates that tasted like salt and regret" and humming off-key. Rhythmic control shifts perfectly under pressure (staccato commands during merge), though "resiliently positive grin" borders on label in one high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phantom espresso" and "auroral thread" exemplify high-density propulsion. One microscopic flaw: "swirling constellation that matched the sky" slightly overwrites during steering climax where simpler phrasing would heighten tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Slipping sideways" reframing surrender feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (merged radio voices, steering via heartbeats) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional specificity ("mother’s laughter died in a different decade") avoiding generic templates.</comment>
