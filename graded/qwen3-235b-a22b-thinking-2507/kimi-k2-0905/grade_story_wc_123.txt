<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "motivation to nurture integrity flared like a lantern in wind" amid surveillance panic; flaw-driven choice to release truth strips safety but embodies stakes. Minor abstraction in "integrity depends on solitude" slightly dilutes embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "taste the silvered proof" crystallizes stakes through rain’s texture. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via lichen map’s revelation—while "unrecorded by any official gauge" makes conceptual cost undeniable without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lichen map constrains Elara’s final choice, charging closure via "calibrated her anemometer to the lichen’s faint pulse." Courtyard’s "ivy-latticed wall" and shaft’s "wet limestone" evolve with action, avoiding white-room syndrome through sensory specificity tied to meteorological expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: "proceed laterally" shifts from directive to tactical method, narrowing options until "solitude complete yet populated" crystallizes cost. The pigeon’s tube forces trade-offs (safety vs. truth) with visible price in her underground endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image "truth, once released, finds its own velocity" reweights the lichen map’s earlier role as non-literal answer to censorship, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through "raw screams of pressure" versus "smoothed forecasts," with rain’s taste embodying earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature ("sky bruised into violet," wind shear noted "to the third decimal") filters all detail through meteorologist’s lens. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: short clauses during descent ("She descended until...") mirror urgency without sacrificing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "ice traced her spine" avoids bodily cliché via concrete embodiment. "Phosphorescent lichen drew a map" achieves high density—simultaneously advancing plot, setting, and theme—without figurative muddle. Minor synonym risk in "quiet certainty" vs. "integrity" barely nicks perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms pigeon trope via meteorological context: bird as "living shuttle" through pneumatic layers reframes courier cliché. Risk-taking (quarantine = truth-container) heightens stakes coherently, though "rogue zone" concept edges near familiar dystopian shorthand without full novelty.</comment>
