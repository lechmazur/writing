<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; insomnia emerges abruptly without prior setup. Micro-choice of placing telegram against brass shows embodied motivation, but "I am chronicler/chronicled" realization lacks sufficient contradictory impulses before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost: "shared burdens become shared light" reweights grief into stellar light. Orientation clear by line 3. Minor POV leakage in "we stood" paragraph slightly undermines Accumulative lens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Copper dome and refractor function as micro-setting that charges closure—brass cracks sealing via spectral ink directly constrains healing. "Riveted steel" descriptor feels generic compared to celestial specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decode inscriptions before star dims) escalates through SS Lacertae's fade creating doorway, inscriptions resisting healing, and final pulse delivering resolution. Agency clear in chronicler's spoken petals and telegram placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through daylily's transformation from telegram to eternal bloom without moralizing. "Witness, speak, heal" whispers avoid Thematic Echo only through being action-driven; final line risks near-declaration but saved by "midnight solace" embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruise-shaped syllable," "petals on tongue of midnight solace") with rhythmic control under pressure. Constellation-named boy's dialogue stays coherent without head-hopping; voice modulates from urgent to transcendent flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "smooth glass, lenses through which others might see grief refracted" slightly echoes earlier "refracted" imagery but doesn't obscure closure. Final line's "midnight solace pressed into every petal" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms celestial tropes through hyper-specifics: SS Lacertae's 19.3-hour pulse, orange daylily latitude. "Bruise-shaped syllables" and healing brass cracks synthesize grief/light concept with emotional specificity beyond surface novelty.</comment>
