<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled" realization, where swallowing others' pain becomes embodied insomnia. Micro-choices like placing the telegram against brass reveal value hierarchy, but the boy's transformation lacks sufficient prior pressure to earn his speech shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with "smooth glass, lenses through which others might see grief refracted into hope"—cost legible in temple's crumble and "echo in her pulse." Orientation flawless by word 20, though the boy's sudden human speech slightly strains causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Telescope brass isn't backdrop but active constraint: the daylily's spectral ink heals hairline cracks, directly charging the final image. Observatory's copper dome and star-diaries shape every choice, from flower placement to the dome's desert transformation, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully as SS Lacertae's fade narrows options to "speak syllables or lose inscription," with cost crystallized in "the weight of every story swallowed." Temporal pressure ("before next variable star dimmed") isn't leveraged enough early to tighten escalation further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "bruise-shaped syllables" blooming daylilies, cracks sealing via "words older than iron." Final whisper "Witness, speak, heal" reweights "shared burdens" into shared light without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"star-charts rustled like sleeping birds" reflects chronicler's dream-adjacent focus. Under stress, syntax compresses ("She spoke aloud the petal-syllables. The temple answered") while maintaining lyrical rhythm. No POV leakage despite "we" perspective shift during dome transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("petal-syllables" simultaneously conveys texture, action, and theme). Only microscopic flaw: "solace pressed into every petal" slightly overextends metaphor but is redeemed by earned payoff in final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "healing words" trope through specific mechanics: syllables as "bruise-shaped," light as "midnight solace on the tongue." Emotional truth in "grief was her own insomnia" avoids abstraction, with risk-taking (lyric closure, conceptual repricing) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
