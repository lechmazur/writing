<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete details (voice cracking on "no political will") and embodied choices (waiting past safe time), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond "outlast" resolve; grandmother's tooth-marks on focus ring deepens motivation without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: shutter clicks crystallize the cost of extinction ("only color left") with the crimson sand grain confirming "last possible second"; orientation anchors by line 3, pressure tightens via chemical timer under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlit summit constrains choices (Earth's glow enables photography, basalt shard burial spot), and grandmother's camera focus ring charges the final image; "vitrified regolith crunching" exemplifies tactile specificity but summit geography lacks tactical pressure beyond wind-triggered closing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document extinction before UV sterilization) tightens via chemical timer's 43-minute countdown; "outlast" action directly confronts time pressure with visible cost (fossil imprints), though escalation leans slightly abstract without physical barrier beyond the wind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Ghost flower pressed into stone" reweights extinction without moralizing; "curiosity was just another form of mourning" risks thematic echo but is tempered by her question, while film as "only color left" delivers resonant non-literal answer to witnessing's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives ("regolith glittered like shattered glass," "bioluminescent regret"); syntax modulates perfectly under stress ("shutter once, twice, three times"); zero head-hopping and lunar lexicon ("terminator wind," "fossil imprint") remains consistent through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "diluted blood" simile for sand blush avoids cliché through context; final line "no margin" delivers devastating propulsion; "phosphorescent regret" walks poetic edge but earns its weight via haptic lining sync.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hourglass sand as chemical timer transforms extinction trope with specific lunar logic; "lunar anemones" feel freshly imagined through vitrified regolith constraints; avoids safety middle by tying witness urgency to expiring contract, not just natural cycle.</comment>
