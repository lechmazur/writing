<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "purposefully curious" micro-choices (burying sand grain, waiting to shoot) under UV time pressure; embodied grief in cracked voice and haptic heartbeat sync avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of witnessing earns cost through film’s fragility, though grandmother’s backstory edges toward convenient resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: crimson sand grain and fossil imprint crystallize irreversible extinction with conceptual cost ("only color left"). Accumulative lens holds via tightening timer/anemone folding; orientation flawless ("vitrified regolith glittered like shattered glass" by line 3). No causality breaks, but "bioluminescent regret" slightly strains physical logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Moon summit micro-setting constrains every choice: UV threat forces timer mechanics, feldspar vein enables anemones, Earthrise dictates lighting. Camera’s worn focus ring charges closure with grandmother’s tooth-marks. Sensory hierarchy perfect—crystalline clicks during folding narrow perception under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via inspector’s agency: waiting until buried grain blushes risks missing shot but proves "witnessing as resistance." Cost crystallizes in fossil imprint’s permanence. UV deadline creates relentless pressure, though secondary stake (contract expiry) feels slightly underexploited compared to extinction urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "stolen grain" motif: final fossil imprint reweights "purposefully curious" as mourning. No moralizing—image of "ghost flower pressed into stone" answers "why document?" without abstraction. Ghosts of engineers deepen complexity, though "terraforming lilies" reference risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "vitrified regolith glittered like shattered glass" filters science through poetic urgency. Syntax modulates with tension—staccato shutter clicks vs. flowing Earthrise descriptions. Zero head-hopping; melancholy tone evolves organically from anticipation to elegy during anemone folding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystalline clicks" compresses action/image density. "Bioluminescent regret" risks purple prose but earns payoff in visor shadows. Final paragraph’s "flushed sudden crimson" avoids muddle—exact cost legible. Minor deduction for "tooth-marks" slightly overwrought but charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms extinction trope via chemical sand timer mechanics and lunar biology specificity. "Purposefully curious" reframes scientific duty as elegy. Risks poetic density ("dawnlit melancholy") but maintains clarity; fossil imprint’s freshness avoids safety-middle. Near-echo of "last witness" trope slightly limits originality.</comment>
