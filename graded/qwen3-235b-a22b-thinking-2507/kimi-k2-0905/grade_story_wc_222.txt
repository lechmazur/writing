<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Vespers' "sacredly playful" stance during the shadow-stair dare, where thievery and reverence coexist. Halcyon's fear-of-heights secret via knight move elegantly reveals interiority. Minor deduction for the child apprentice's abrupt introduction lacking prior causal setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Halcyon stepping onto the shadow stair crystallizes the "amend truth" stake with visible cost (white knuckles, cracking chessboard). Accumulative lens holds through whispered secrets and tilting board. Sky's "convulsion" timing slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (casting shadow-stair, sealing borrowed hour) and charges the final image. "Frozen song" mirror for descent proves environment alters tactics. "Sickly light" descriptor lacks specificity in one peak beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully via bishop swap—Vespers' agency alters board physics to force Halcyon's choice. Cost legible in "knuckles white on parapet" and melting forgiveness runes. Sky's "wrong" timeframe could heighten urgency earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of chess piece "carving perfect zero" reweights everything as resonant answer to "amend truth" without moralizing. "Locked truth contains hidden spring" emerges organically from sundial mechanics. Avoids thematic echo by showing, not telling, wonder's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("colors bleeding like bruised glass," "coat billowing like torn moonlight") remains consistent under pressure. Rhythm modulates perfectly: short staccato during wind scene, flowing cadence at climax. Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "wind tried to peel her" shows action; "echo of bells guiding footholds" integrates image with momentum. One minor deduction for "sickly light" in high-pressure beat—generic where specificity expected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms thief/chess tropes through specific mechanics (secrets inside pieces, upward falling). "Apprentice of wonder" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
