<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vespers’ "steal only what people no longer dare to keep" ethos versus her sacredly playful risk-taking. Flaw: Halcyon’s fear-of-heights secret lacks embodied contradiction during the game’s pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Halcyon’s ascent reconfigures "amending truth" with conceptual cost (secrets melting into forgiveness). Sky’s "wrong" colors bookend the stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the pocket sundial lid’s shadow stair directly constrains the climax choice and charges the final image ("a new shadow spilled upward"). Icebound spire actively pressures tactics via wind and collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Vespers’ agency—sacrificing her queen, swapping the bishop—but Halcyon’s fear-of-heights secret feels underdeveloped as pressure, slightly muddying the dominant "amend truth" trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess pieces’ melting secrets ("spelled forgiveness") and Vespers’ final line about "swapping certainty for astonishment," avoiding moralizing while reweighting "wonder" as active courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vespers’ perceptual signature ("tasting the colors," "frozen song") creates distinct rhythmic control. Voice modulates perfectly from playful ("amused the wind") to sacred resolve ("boots skimming the rim") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "notes freezing into tiny bells" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction: "sacredly playful" risks label-speak in peak tension, though rescued by immediate action ("invited the lord to amend his life").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality in transforming "chess secrets" into tangible stakes (fear-of-heights, stolen memories) and the "shadow stair" as earned wonder. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—sky’s "wrong" colors drive the entire premise.</comment>
