<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "gritty whimsy bubbling up like blood" and the prophet/erasure dilemma, but the bomb-building backstory lacks concrete embodiment under stress, slightly weakening the 12-year-old motivation's visceral charge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara's dissolution into transmission reconfigures options with undeniable cost ("her own erasure"), while the Accumulative lens holds through lyrical escalation from fragmented whispers to world-altering broadcast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory pressures choices via lightning flashes illuminating the workspace during critical moments, but the dome windows and static remain atmospheric rather than actively constraining tactics until the portico manifests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through prophetic lyrics deepens the dominant stake (dawn/shadow trade-off) with each syllable, but the final aged-voice lyric slightly relies on coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "static between stations" as the final image reweights "dawn" into "permission" without moralizing, perfectly satisfying the non-literal answer requirement through the girl hearing laughter in her basement radio.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stardust-stained fingers" and staccato rhythm during storm peaks, though "burning with fever" momentarily drifts toward stock phrasing before recovering with visceral "blood from a bitten tongue" imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "cobalt glass shards" recurrence functions as intentional pattern-teaching, while "laugh like breaking glass" achieves maximum density without overwriting—only a hairline deduction for slight rhythmic uniformity in reflection fragments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes via radio static as existential metaphor; the "better nightmares" synthesis feels inevitable, with risky lyrical density heightening stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
