<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns with concrete contradiction: preserving messy memory while understanding she must not stop the prophet. Micro-choices (unfolding antenna, singing back) reveal her hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("fingers dancing across dials... machinery and faith"). No diagnostic label-speak; the prophet's off-page presence limits relationship dynamics but doesn't harm her earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a flawless Charged Poise: Elara realizing "shaping a new dawn meant teaching light to hold space for its own shadows," with conceptual cost (preserved memories as shadows) made undeniable by the prophet's flickering certainty. Orientation is immediate (stormlit observatory above clouds), but escalation lacks meaningful protagonist-driven tightening under the Accumulative lens—the storm intensifies passively rather than through her choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico constrains every choice: catching dying knowledge like "insects in amber," crystallizing lightning into a "frozen tree of light," then pulsing with song to charge the final image. Storm pressure actively shapes tactics (wind howling through dome), while micro-setting as tool transforms from observation to memory vessel to resistance mechanism without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. prophet's forgetting) is signaled early and deepens through Elara's realization she must preserve, not stop. Pressure tightens via the prophet's escalating miracles and her grandmother's clarifying voice, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the storm and transmissions drive change while Elara reacts. Cost is conceptual (weight of memory) but unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through radio as memory vessel: "shadows aren't darkness—they're what's left when light forgets to be honest." Final image of variant allegiances "blooming like flowers through cracks in his certainty" reweights shadows as necessary complexity without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; the non-literal answer crystallizes in Elara's realization about light holding space for shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound like rusted bells," "ink in water") and rhythmic control under pressure (fragmented sentences during lightning strike). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure. Slight register drift with "variant allegiance" (academic term in poetic context) prevents 9.0, but no head-hopping and consistent focalization elevate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose soars with textural specificity ("brass antenna array," "blue-white light that branched through every possible tomorrow") but contains minor paraphrase loops: "through fragmented radio frequencies" repeats verbatim three times. Overwriting in "lightning forked through the cloud-sea below" (redundant with "cloud-sea") dulls momentum slightly, though closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio ghosts as memory vessels transforms the "lonely visionary" trope. "Ancient shadows" redefined as "parts of ourselves we learned to fear" avoids cliché, while the prophet's duality ("the thing that wears my face") deepens stakes. Risk-taking in making both visionary and prophet prisoners of their roles heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
