<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied metaphors ("paper lungs collapsed around verbs too sharp to inhale"), but brother remains a reflection without agency; micro-choices like kneeling with shard show hierarchy of values under pressure. Felt cost of lip cut healing anchors endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "I'm sorry" seeds without echo, cost legible in healing lip cut. Accumulative lens holds through condensation pattern; orientation nailed by "mangrove labyrinth breathed salt" in line one. Final drop of water crystallizes reconfigured options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangroves actively constrain choices—water healing like skin enables corridor, roots shift "like fingers letting go." Final rainspout image pulses with "rhythm of two hearts," charging closure. Micro-setting (shard) evolves from limestone to heartbeat to warm rainspout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when protagonist sees brother writing "come back whole" on fogged window—agency crystallizes in kneeling to speak. Cost is visceral: lip cut healing in moonlight, knuckles bleeding. Dominant stake (unspoken apology) forecloses path via spoken words with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through condensation motif reweighted at end: brother reads "come back whole" on fresh window, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("mouth full of moonlit syllables that heal in moonlight") answers central question with earned ambiguity—no tidy resolution, only forward motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("hair dripping tide-pool silver," "knotted throats hummed lullaby"), but "cryptic no more, her face an open envelope" drifts into abstraction during peak stress. Rhythmic control falters slightly in "limestone became glass, then breath, then nothing" sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Limestone became glass, then breath, then nothing" creates mixed metaphor in closure beat, dulling immediacy. Otherwise impeccable propulsion: "soles slicing through black water that healed in moonlight" compresses action/image. No loops, but one figurative muddle prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove spirits weaving apologies through roots transforms apology trope. "Heals in moonlight" trait subverts healing clichés by tying to water’s behavior and lip cut. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional truth.</comment>
