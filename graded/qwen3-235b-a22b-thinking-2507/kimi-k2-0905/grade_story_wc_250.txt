<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "silence could be a form of empathy" versus secret-pressing ribs, but "spiralingly calm" edges toward abstract label without sufficient embodied cost during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: darkness "no longer lonely but accompanied by the memory" reconfigures the core premise with undeniable conceptual cost, while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through refracted starlight evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dock’s rain-slicked cobbles constrain movement and enable mirror-reflected constellations, while the dental mirror as micro-setting charges the final image holding "a single captured star"—environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as she presses the humming mirror to her chest, transforming darkness from "hungry" to "full of borrowed starlight," but the abstract conflict lacks one visceral tactical cost during the dance sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shutter-pattern physics and mirror refraction, with the final image offering resonant answer: darkness "accompanied by the memory" reweights absence as potential without moralizing—pure earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "bruised colors" and "shutter-slats code," with rhythmic control tightening during the dance; minor filter-verb cluster ("she felt it watching") barely touches pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion—"ripples spiral outward," "dancing the light across the water"—but adjacent "darkness pooled... darkness followed" risks subtle loop without full pattern payoff in that beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian" trope through dental mirror’s physics-driven starlight teaching; risks poetic structure yet pays off with darkness’s conceptual reweighting—specific, non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
