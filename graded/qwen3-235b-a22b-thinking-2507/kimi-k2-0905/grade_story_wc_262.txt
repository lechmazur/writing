<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (recovering mother's lyrics) is concrete and embodied through "palms to rusted reel" and incubating love in air. Contradictory impulses surface in her hesitation versus action when the film threads itself. Final choice—scratching release lyrics—is earned by prior causality, but the off-page mother limits secondary pressure depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "love unused is not gone; it loops" reweights the premise with emotional cost (tears blurring ink, letter transforming). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation (dust → vision → projector activation), though cost legibility lacks one pinpoint sentence for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting charging closure: the reel coiled in Mara's bag transforms the space into a "vault ready for next heart." Dust, crystal sphere, and perforated frames constrain choices (threading film) and reappear in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency—scratching new lyrics forces a trade-off (releasing love vs. hoarding it). Cost is unmistakable: the blank letter gains words but transforms into film threading her chest, altering her tactics as she leaves with ashes and reel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the film strip's physical loop, culminating in the mother's postscript: "Love is never unused, only stored." Final image (letter becoming film threading Mara's chest) answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV stability anchors the accumulative lens with crystal-focused diction ("incubate," "psychometry"). Perceptual signature shines in "spatially imaginative mind" overlaying brightness, though "hushed thunder" repetition slightly dulls rhythmic control under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("dust floated like slow film frames") but risks overwriting in the vision sequence ("tenor forgetting words, girl mouthing missing line"). No loops, yet "pigeons fluttered like white sprocket holes" strains metaphor coherence without undermining closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Psychometry + film tech synthesizes "unused love" into a physical loop, avoiding cliché through nitrate-wax specificity. Emotional truth in the blank letter's transformation feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
