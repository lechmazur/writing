<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied through crystal/film metaphors; micro-choices like scratching lyrics show contradictory impulses. Lacks visceral friction between "incubating love" and grief's paralysis in peak beats, missing 9+ causality test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: "love is never unused" postscript reweights the premise while tears blur ink. Orientation clear by word 15; accumulative lens holds through hushed thunder motif to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Projection booth constrains every choice—rusted reel, sprocket holes, velvet seats charge the final image. Micro-setting mastery: crystal sphere powered by "hushed thunder" becomes the story’s sensory anchor, passing 9+ gate decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when film threads itself, narrowing options to Mara’s lyric-scratching. Agency flaw: escalation relies on film’s autonomy (coincidence) rather than her choices, violating "protagonist drives escalation" requirement despite beautiful cost in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through film-strip metaphor—"love loops, searching for splice"—without moralizing. Final image of letter turning to film threading into Mara’s chest delivers non-literal answer to "where unused love is stored," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dust floated like slow film frames" filters reality through Mara’s spatial imagination. Rhythmic control under pressure ("storm without rain, like applause") teaches and pays off lyric compression, with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pigeons fluttered like white sprocket holes" recharges motif with precision. Minor overwriting in "crystal gazer Mara Teasdale pressed her palms" (redundant title) prevents 9.5, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned theater" trope through film-as-love metaphor; every detail (wax seals, cigarette case) serves emotional logic. Risk-taking (psychometry as plot engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
