<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied contradiction ("trapped between spaces") and micro-choices like wading toward the staircase. Ghost's motivation lacks full dimensionality; her betrayal backstory risks summary over dramatization at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully when he realizes the "code" must be embraced, not unraveled. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: each water-damaged page deepens the mystery with causal density. No orientation debt; cost crystallizes in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house functions as active constraint—water parts for him, costumes float—charging the final image. Antique program serves as micro-setting that constrains choices. Slight overwriting in "Victorian dress floating like a jellyfish" dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as he descends into archives, with agency clear in opening the case. Dominant stake (artistic invisibility) interweaves with ghost's betrayal. "Disruption" concept isn't tested concretely until final beat, missing one escalation step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "between-spaces" motif; final image of playing "the music in spaces between" reweights the premise without moralizing. "Real art lived" edges toward thematic echo but avoids penalty through concrete execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines through acoustic details ("sound traveled differently through water and air"). Rhythmic control under pressure flawless. One filter verb ("he understood") in high-stakes beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm varies naturally ("water seemed to part for him as if recognizing his purpose"). "Symphony of the unsung" borders on purple prose but earns resonance through thematic integration. Peak-beat clarity impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through pit musician specificity and water-damage conceit. Flooded opera house as metaphor for marginalization feels fresh. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; every detail serves the core concept.</comment>
