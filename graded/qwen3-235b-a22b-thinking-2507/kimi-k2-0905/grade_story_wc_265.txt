<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in gear-release dilemma (certainty vs wonder), but "understood then: every translocation scraped off a layer" edges toward abstract summary. Embodied cost in "tasted oil and childhood cinnamon" grounds the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: dropping the gear risks total dissolution ("become another ghost of foliage"), crystallized in "You are not lost; you are distributed." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through rhythmic density buildup to the final "hollow note."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: quartz roots dictate cadence-counting tactics, mercury brook forces self-confrontation. The gear-as-tool charges closure when dropped into the jaguar’s gearbox, making environment indispensable to the final image of "copper tree humming with probable miracles."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake tightening peaks when jaguar demands she "give away the thing that keeps you rooted," narrowing options to surrender or stagnation. Cost legible in "last faithful flake of her original mind," though "forest’s engines coughed" slightly relies on environmental coincidence rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear motif’s evolution—from "warm as a sparrow" to "whispering: 'To rediscover, first unravel'"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights translocation as distribution without stating theme, earning resonance via "hollow note... ready to be filled by your own probable miracle."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in rhythmic tree cadences ("banyan 3/4, teak 5/8") and gear-focused noticing. Minor register drift in "probable miracles stitched from chlorophyll and chrome" slightly distances voice during translocation climax, but compression remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "boots dangling from a vine of coaxial cable" specificity, but scaffold appears in "face flickering between selves... each one carrying a smaller gear" (redundant phrasing). Near-closure metaphor "cyclone of leaves and numbers" risks slight muddle, avoiding major deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via mechanical rainforest’s functional logic (solar-panel leaves, gear-toothed parrots). Risk-taking with lyric structure heightens stakes—translocation rules feel earned, not gimmicky—while "distributed" reframing avoids safe middle-ground hedging.</comment>
