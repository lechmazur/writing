<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in gear-dropping dilemma; embodied emotion ("tasted oil and childhood cinnamon") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation earned through prior scrapes, but jaguar lacks character depth as pressure source.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise ("You are not lost; you are distributed") with conceptual cost of becoming banyan. Accumulative lens holds via polymetric cadence tightening; orientation clear by "copper canopy" opening. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting gear constrains climax (dropping it enables transformation) and charges final image ("small gears turning"). Sensory hierarchy filtered through philosopher's mechanical bias elevates specificity beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: gear-hesitation to surrender deepens "rediscover mind" stake. Cost unmistakable in "becoming a new banyan" with conceptual price of identity dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (unraveling reflection, gear surrender), not statement. Final whisper "To rediscover, first unravel" reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ quick test via resonant closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "parrots are gear-toothed" and polymeter counting. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("banyan 3/4, teak 5/8"), with purposeful elision taught by "translocated during sleep" opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle in "tuning fork struck by moonlight" slightly obscures physics but fits dream logic. Zero loops; high density maintained except one borderline mixed metaphor in early peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical/biological tropes through specific constraints (mercury brook, data-loom). Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing transformation test via gear's irreplaceable role.</comment>
