<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("digital ghost" vs. heartbeat count) and embodied emotion ("breath fogging like old film") power micro-choices under pressure; clerk interaction slightly lacks secondary character depth despite emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "I walk toward the horizon... each breath a syllable of wisdom" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (heartbeat 98,001); accumulative lens holds flawlessly through ink-map revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opal observatory functions as micro-setting: dome hatch constrains action, inkwell charges final image ("half-glint" dome mirrors frozen tears); snow’s Morse code actively pressures the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (living with life’s fragility) deepens via ink-map realization; escalation through conceptual cost (frozen tears as "tiny observatory domes") but clerk encounter slightly simplifies tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "failure is a telescope" crystallizes through ink patterns, not moralizing; final horizon walk reweights premise without abstraction, though "corridor" metaphor edges toward slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soft mechanical tick inside my ribs") with rhythmic control under pressure; "voice rough as unspooled tape" slightly disrupts otherwise seamless voice modulation during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with exceptional density ("snow taps... in Morse: stay, stay, stay"), but "dendrites of regret, axons of almost" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: barcode error transforms "digital ghost" trope through hyper-specific medical bureaucracy; porcelain shard’s heartbeat resonance feels inevitable yet unprecedented, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
