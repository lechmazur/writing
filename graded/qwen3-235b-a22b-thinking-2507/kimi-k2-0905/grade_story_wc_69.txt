<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s expectant resignation and grief-subtracting humming; embodied emotion through syllable collection lacks secondary pressure but earns endurance via rosette sacrifice. Final renunciation feels earned by prior causality yet lacks visible interpersonal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the crumbling rosette crystallizes Mara’s silent endurance foreclosing vocal artistry. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through syllable braiding to city heartbeat shift; cost legible in "decibel subtraction" and vanishing root tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet library functions as micro-setting constraining choice—rosette drinking lamplight enables silence-harvesting. Sensory hierarchy (cedar/candle smoke to saffron/iron scents) mirrors emotional progression; moonlit stained glass charges final image by embodying braided voices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: humming minor thirds to singing the sacrifice song narrows options toward voice forfeiture. Hatred’s "decibel subtraction" makes cost visceral, though internal/external conflict interweaving remains subtle; one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "traveled stillness" reweighted from absorbed footfalls to humming children—no moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer: enemy as "note that does not belong" reconfigures prior material through concrete particulars (sawdust circle, braided scale).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: librarian’s "traveled stillness" and "frequencies anger forgets" reflect choir-teacher POV. Rhythmic control falters slightly in descriptive clusters ("saffron, iron, and river water"), but lyrical compression serves Accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("velvet turned inside out" crystallizes silence). Minor rhythmic monotony in "walked... touched... paused" sequence, but cadence shifts during midnight braiding sustain propulsion without dulling closure’s heartbeat image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts transformed via mulberry rosette’s tangible mechanics—not abstract metaphor. Fresh synthesis: silence as subtractive harmony reconfigures "enemy" through musical physics. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
