<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's embodied grief and micro-choices (humming minor third, pressing ear to rosette) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. Flaw: "expectantly resigned" trait lacks concrete tradeoff cost despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Mara hears the city's heartbeat rearranging; conceptual cost of vanishing arts made undeniable by the crumbling rosette. Lens (Accumulative) holds coherently through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet library functions as active micro-setting: books exhaling banned lullabies directly constrains Mara's choices, while the rosette's dust-circle final image charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through syllable collection to root-tone sacrifice under Accumulative lens. Cost (rosette's disintegration) is legible but slightly abstract; societal change feels earned though personal cost lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "enemy as wrong note" metaphor without moralizing. Final image of children humming reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding tidy resolution while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet turned inside out," "traveled stillness") modulates rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's humming children.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "velvet turned inside out" strains physical logic. Minor lexical illusion in "seventeen syllables" disrupts otherwise perfect textural specificity in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms music-healing trope through subtractive harmony premise. Risk-taking (vanishing arts as negative space) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with specificity anchoring emotional truth in mulberry wood's decay.</comment>
