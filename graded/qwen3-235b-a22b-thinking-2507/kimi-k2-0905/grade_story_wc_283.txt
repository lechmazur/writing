<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (cataloging buttons) reveals contradictory impulses—mending vs. measuring—but limited external pressure narrows emotional range despite strong embodied choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("weight return—not of sand but of choice"), and Accumulative lens holds; however, minimal escalation beyond sensory accumulation weakens pressure tightening at the critical turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice (e.g., buttons as tools), charging the final image where buttons "gleam like constellations"; specificity in resinous beams and fossilized honey directly shapes the protagonist’s methodology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broken prophecy) deepens through button cataloging, but stakes remain abstract—lacking visceral testing of "world narrow to thread" consequences—until the final reconfiguration, weakening cost legibility during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through buttons as discarded fasteners, culminating in the resonant final line "garment we button together" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in sensory details (turpentine, salt, metallic tang).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed") maintains voice consistency, though slight detachment in "quietly inspired" risks emotional ventriloquism without deeper internal rupture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level precision shines ("resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey"), but "unearthed silence" slightly muddles metaphor coherence in the climax, risking clarity while aiming for lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms mundane buttons into prophecy-menders through specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, making the reconfiguration feel inevitable.</comment>
