<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "prophecy broken" vs. "unscramble it" drive; micro-choices like grouping buttons by "pitch of grief" reveal values under pressure. Final renunciation of measuring loss for "gathering beginnings" earned through tactile cataloging, with visible cost in "weight return—not of sand but of choice."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "every grain of possibility hovered, waiting for fingers willing to spin prophecy into raw, rebuttoned possibility" reweights stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—button density deepens pressure, and "unearthed silence" crystallizes options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber warehouse isn't backdrop but active constraint: its "unearthed silence" enables hearing button stories, while "resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey" shapes perception. Buttons as recurring object charge closure ("constellations that had finally agreed on a story"), meeting 9+ gate by constraining the restringing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via button cataloging density—"with each classification the jar quivered"—narrowed options toward the silence breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable: "weight return—not of sand but of choice" reconfigures the prophecy’s meaning under Accumulative lens, driven entirely by protagonist’s agency in grouping and restringing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button stories, not statement; final image ("future is a garment we button together") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "world narrow to a thread" prophecy. Avoids thematic echo—wisdom arrives as "scent," not sermon—while "rebuttoned possibility" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed" filters setting through turner’s temporal sensitivity. Rhythm modulates under pressure—"boots crunching on plastic four-hole squares"—with no head-hopping. Elision (monastery backstory) taught early and paid off via jar’s purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fossilized honey" and "iron and sage" achieve textural specificity without muddle. Final line ("waiting to be chosen again") propels closure with crystalline rhythm. Figurative language sparse but potent ("silence that settled like dust"), never obscuring causality in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timekeeping and mending: buttons as witnesses transforms prophecy trope through concrete details (walrus ivory polar bear, chewed Bakelite). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—emotional truth in "every ending is fabric awaiting reassembly" avoids generic hope.</comment>
