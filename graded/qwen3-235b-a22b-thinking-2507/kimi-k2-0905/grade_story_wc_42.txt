<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (repairer vs. releaser) drives every micro-choice; "luminous ache" evolves from physical sensation to embodied farewell without labels. Final renunciation earned by prior causality in the Hasselblad ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the observatory's collapse into the photograph reweights time as memory's negative. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density crystallizes in the leaf's sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The clock hand constrains choices (timer mechanism) and charges the final image (frozen in photo containing futures). Lunar dust as lubricant makes the Hasselblad a setting that actively enables the closure act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: harnessing the ephemeral requires self-erasure, visible in "corridors that now angled like light through prism glass." Cost is legible in the observatory becoming "the photograph itself."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the leaf's sound orbiting the moon reweights "luminous ache" as necessary loss. No moralizing—final image answers the central question via the silver afterimage "proof that she had once lived among instruments that measured everything except how to let go."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in lunar-specific observations ("lunar dust for lubricant"); rhythm modulates under pressure ("one, two, three— / On three the observatory exhaled"). Zero head-hopping despite single POV depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "brown and brittle" leaf does triple duty (visual, tactile, foreshadowing). Final line’s "quiet whir" callback achieves rhythmic closure without muddle. Information density peaks in the shutter-click "soft guillotine."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms repair tropes via lunar specificity: the observatory as camera reframing time. Emotional truth in "repair what you can, but when the foundations shake, restructure yourself." Avoids abstraction through tools (Hasselblad, clock hand) as lived-in extensions of self.</comment>
