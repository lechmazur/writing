<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "repair what you can" vs. "restructure yourself," crystallized when Mira becomes part of the ephemeral she harnesses. Micro-choice to seal the clock hand into the camera—prioritizing capture over control—earns her final release with visible cost in the dissolving observatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the observatory folding into the photograph reweights time’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost ("proof that she had once lived among instruments that measured everything except how to let go"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density accumulation to the origami collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The impossible leaf—recurring object charging the final image—constrains Mira’s countdown and dissolves into the sound that guides her departure. Lunar dust as camera lubricant and telescope mirrors on the shuttle prove micro-setting drives tactics, meeting the 9+ gate by charging the closure’s "luminous ache" resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: "harness the ephemeral" evolves from abstract desire to concrete action when she sets the Hasselblad inward, foreclosing her constant orbit. Cost is unmistakable in the observatory’s collapse into the photograph, though "escape velocity" remains thematic rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the camera metaphor’s evolution: the final image of the fractured shuttle reflections reweights "letting go" as non-literal answer to measuring time. Avoids moralizing; "measured everything except how to let go" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "luminous ache" refrains and moth-like clock hand; rhythmic control under pressure peaks with the leaf-falling countdown. Elision (mentor’s warning) is taught early via the photograph and paid off in the CR closure, avoiding head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soft guillotine" shutter click demonstrates high density without muddle. "Brown and brittle" leaf briefly risks generic description, but the sound’s reprise in the final orbit salvages specificity. Propulsion never flags, even in lyrical beats like the corridor walk "writing her out of the station’s memory."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of photography/astronomy metaphors avoids sci-fi tropes (e.g., lunar observatory "above the clouds"). Risk-taking heightens stakes—the impossible leaf transforms from ornamental to essential—but "escape velocity" leans thematic, slightly diluting causal integration despite bold structural choices.</comment>
