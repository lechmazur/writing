<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is embodied through concrete micro-choices (pocketing photo, bluffing Hask), with her medical background vs. tracer choice creating authentic contradiction. Final endurance—uploading proof despite risk—earns closure through prior causality, though Hask's collapse lacks sufficient physical cost detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Hask's collapse crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("sudden gravity of voices"), fulfilling Causal lens escalation. Orientation anchors ("mist-clad atrium") established by line 3, and the "reeling hush" motif charges the final image without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium actively constrains choices (condensation recording heartbeats in rust, koi pond as evidence sink), while the hearing aid functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("let the battery die"). Sunrise burning off mist reweights heroism with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira's agency: photo discovery → voice verification → ledger confrontation narrows options under causal lens. The visible cost (Hask's career collapse) and conceptual price (truth restored) are unmistakable on-page, with "incidental heroism" stake signaled early via clipboard and obituary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Lila's ledger signature, the uploaded proof, and final line ("heroism is rarely chosen; it is overheard") reweight the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by tying "incidental heroism" to Mira's physical actions rather than abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet swallows light," "Morse without code") modulates rhythm under pressure (short sentences during confrontation). Voice consistency holds through high-stakes beats, with "reeling hush" motif taught early and paid off in the final image's syncopated heartbeat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: high density ("clipboard labeled 'contact tracer' half-draped in moss"), no synonym loops, and figurative language never muddles causality. Final line's rhythm ("confident that at least one tracer remained...") provides propulsion without overwriting, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic thriller tropes via specific logic: "hearing dead via hearing aid" reframed as pulse-tracking, with Lila's ledger replacing generic "secret document." Emotional truth in Mira's quiet victory avoids safety-hedging, though sunrise metaphor slightly edges toward cliché.</comment>
