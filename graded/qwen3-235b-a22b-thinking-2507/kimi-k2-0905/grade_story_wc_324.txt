<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete sensory details ("taste of penny candy and chlorine"), but the adopted daughter's characterization lacks contradictory impulses; her emotional shift from "reeling hush" to steadiness feels earned yet slightly under-scrutinized in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "tears falling in the same rhythm as the pulses," and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; minor deduction for the atrium's carousel reveal feeling slightly abrupt despite functional foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the hearing aid and carousel photograph constrain choices and charge the final image (frozen carousel horses), fulfilling the 9+ gate; mist and atrium evolve causally with emotional states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully through pulse intensification and the women's convergence, but the single tightening lacks a visible price *shaping tactics*—the cost is resonant yet not actively altering choices mid-beat as high-band requires.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the photograph's transformation and "incidental heroism" action; avoids moralizing, but "protect vulnerable voices" borders on thematic echo in the explanatory paragraph, narrowly missing 9.0's non-literal answer purity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of iron and lilies") and rhythmic control shine, though the final dialogue's "I found—" risks sentimentality, causing slight register drift from the established voice's restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but two paraphrase loops ("reeling hush" repetition, "pulse emerged... pulse grew urgent") and minor syntactic monotony in the middle section prevent higher scores despite exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "grief counselor" trope via hearing aid pulses and carousel photo feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric compression, object-as-setting) heightens stakes without obscuring closure, meeting 9+ quick test with emotional specificity.</comment>
