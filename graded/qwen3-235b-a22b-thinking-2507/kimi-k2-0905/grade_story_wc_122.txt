<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mara’s deafness shapes every sensory detail without diagnostic labels; her contradictory impulses (seeking hush yet fearing grief) crystallize in the tactile climax where she welcomes pain "like a drumroll under ribs." Temen’s silent pressure through shared drum-making forces authentic endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density intensifies as reversed vibrations "peel translucent layers" from numbness, culminating in Earned Stasis where grief’s arrival forecloses numbness with visible cost ("tears silver as tin"). Closure reconfigures silence into resonance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The brass-and-oak phonograph’s "jagged tip" and pedal lathe’s "hush of felt bearings" constrain choices and charge the ending—Mara feels the drum’s heartbeat "more clearly than any sound," proving micro-setting necessity. Every detail (frost, cedar dust) mirrors her internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally: numbness as "emotion wrapped in felt" tightens through Mara’s agency (filing the needle, pressing palms to surfaces), with the backward lullaby’s physical sensation ("shy knock" in her bones) making grief’s cost unmistakable. One intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through tactile particulars: "numbness is only silence waiting to be spun backward into song" reweights the opening filament of hush. Final snowflakes landing with "hush she could almost hear" answers the central question without moralizing, embracing grief’s complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Mara’s tactile lexicon: vibrations "entering the bones of her ankles," melody "rewound into its mother’s throat." Rhythmic control shifts from staccato action ("pressed... wound... set") to lyrical sensation, with zero head-hopping despite Temen’s presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "peeled a translucent layer from the numb cocoon" achieves triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Sentence rhythm accelerates during the phonograph sequence, then breathes for closure. Final line ("reversing nothing, simply living") crystallizes meaning without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope through tactile specificity—grief as "drumroll under ribs," not auditory sound. Risky sensory-only POV heightens stakes coherently; the drum-making ritual synthesizes numbness and healing into inevitable, fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
