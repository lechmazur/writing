<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luma’s embodied emotion (shard warming against ribs) and micro-choices (whispering pass-phrase) reveal contradictory impulses—seeking joy while fearing its impossibility—but limited interior contradiction beyond grief’s weight slightly weakens flaw integration at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the mural’s "private dawn" crystallizes options with felt cost (sighs traded for laughter), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cider house wall as micro-setting constrains choice (must display film there) and charges the final image ("hose droplet became a tiny sun"), with fog’s tactile presence narrowing perception during crisis per POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Luma’s agency under Accumulative pressure: the impossible memory’s sting tightens options, and visible cost (sighs of sorrow) alters tactics, making joy’s reclamation feel earned without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("refilling the ruined orchard with color") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "lost joy," avoiding moralizing while charging cider-taste mirth with conceptual cost—no thematic echo, only earned subtext in gestures like the dissolving fresco.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised pewter" light, "fermented stars" scent) and rhythmic control under pressure ("noon and twilight rubbed shoulders") teach pattern early; no head-hopping despite layered ghost-POV in Lattice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic laughter" and "pewter quilt" achieve high density without muddle, while syntax breathes with scene needs—final line’s cadence ("sun-drop at a time") crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Risk-taking (lyric structure, fog as memory medium) heightens stakes coherently; "pensive mirth" transforms tropes through verifiable detail (cider-house plaster), making emotional truth feel inevitable, not template-driven.</comment>
