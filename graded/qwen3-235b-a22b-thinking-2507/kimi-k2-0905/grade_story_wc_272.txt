<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("measure the width of our own shadows" vs. "redesign grammar of seeing") and embodied emotion ("voice trembling like the flame") culminate in earned closure: stepping through the mirror forecloses survival with visceral cost in "salt sealed his eyes". Single-POV baseline fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Elian's descent into the sea crystallizes the art/world boundary question with "luminescent ache" migrating to his chest. Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (sinking lighthouse, fragmenting cards) culminating in villagers finding the spiral mirror.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting actively constrains choices (forced descent as walls sink) and charges the final image: the spiral staircase reflected in the mirror reweights prior material. "Iron quadrant warped by humidity" and "salt-stained ledgers" exemplify purposeful, tactile specificity that shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstructing the beloved's face before collapse) tightens through Elian's agency: his tarot reassembly directly enables the mirror-door. Cost is unmistakable in "salt sealed his eyes" though visceral stakes could deepen earlier; escalation under Accumulative lens remains coherent with one meaningful deepening (fragments → truer fracture).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spiral staircase image: villagers' question about art/world boundaries reweights Elian's journey without moralizing. Final line ("waves paint and unpaint the shore") offers resonant, non-literal answer through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo despite philosophical undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hues no patron had ever commissioned," "mildewed breath that tasted of shipwrecked letters") persists under pressure with rhythmic control. Voice modulates from fragmented ("questions rhetorical questions") to crystalline ("fragments joined not into wholeness but into a truer fracture") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("paper wings flutter against his wrist: half a card, then quarter-cards") with clear propulsion. Minor mannerism in "questions rhetorical questions" slightly dulls peak beats but doesn't obscure closure. Final line's cadence ("patience no crestfallen artist could ever match") achieves textural perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse/tarot tropes through "truer fracture" concept; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swapping "luminescent ache" for generic "sadness" would break the closure's charge. Near-miss on 9.0 for slight derivativeness in tarot motif execution.</comment>
