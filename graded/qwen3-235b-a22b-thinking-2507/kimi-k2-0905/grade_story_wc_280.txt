<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under peak pressure; "tasting of iron curtain weights" risks diagnostic label-speak but saved by embodied context. Final endurance (carrying encore) earns cost but micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "orchard dimmed but did not vanish" crystallizes options with felt cost (Lila's departure). Lens (Accumulative) holds via sensory density escalation; orientation delayed but functional for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tarot coin and quince tree constrain choices (tying thread, backward bloom) and charge final image ("warm as living palm"). Sensory hierarchy masterful: "citrine applause, indigo silence" filters perception through ghostly urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (luring possibility from despair) signaled early and deepened through echo-layering; cost legible in Lila's disappearance. Escalation via density increase qualifies under Accumulative lens but lacks visible tradeoffs in tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("hidden wing... ready to raise ghost-light") offers non-literal answer to "time as song" without moralizing. Theme emerges through quince tree's backward bloom reweighting memory's cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "minutes fracture into colored ribbons" embodies ghostly cognition. Rhythmic control under pressure ("soft as rainfall but steady" applause) with intentional compression taught early via "fractured timeline" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moth-eaten brocade—each echo a thread" achieves triple duty (sensory, metaphor, plot). Minor deduction for "tasting of iron curtain weights" bordering on forced metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost tropes via synesthetic mechanics ("citrine applause"), but "rising nostalgia" tone leans familiar. Risk-taking (timeline folding) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity could deepen beyond archetype.</comment>
