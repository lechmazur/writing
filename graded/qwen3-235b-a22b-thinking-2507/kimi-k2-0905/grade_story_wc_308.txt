<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory contradiction ("navigate without moving") earns closure, but motivation remains abstract; arrowhead's blood-drawing power lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("centuries of longing settled like dust" on his face), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through birds' spiral reconfiguration of home.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Towers of bone function as micro-setting that charges the final image (arrowhead merging with sternum), constraining choice through resonant physics ("hummed with same frequency as pulse in chest").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Cael's song deepening the bone towers' resonance, but escalation lacks tangible cost beyond emotional weight; the "wandering pulse" resolution feels earned through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "navigate without moving" into embodied truth ("become the echo itself"), offering non-literal answer to home as recognition rather than movement, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading strata as wings of birds frozen mid-flight") with rhythmic control, though "weathered" repetition risks tic; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters in closure beat with scaffold loops ("weathered resolve... weathered but resolved") and "beat/beat" metaphor repetition, dulling the final image's propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of navigation/stillness through harmonic physics feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric mosaic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though bone towers verge on archetype.</comment>
