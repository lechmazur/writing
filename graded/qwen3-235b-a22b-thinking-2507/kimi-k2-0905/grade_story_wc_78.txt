<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prophet's embodied motivation ("obstacles as instruments") drives every choice; contradictions in striking absence versus physical action crystallize under pressure; final stance crystallization carries visible cost through the labor of sound creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the prophet hearing "orchard become orchestra" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (reality reshaped through art), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fractal sound density tightening tactics from first barrel strike to final heartbeat chorus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Floating orchard functions as active micro-setting: driftwood circle becomes speaker vibrating with memory, peach tree's F# shakes petals that rewrite the score, and bamboo tubes spun by harmonic overtones push against still air—environment directly constrains and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by prophet's agency: striking absence after failed engines transforms silence into groove, with cost made visceral through "thousand micro-rhythms" braiding solitude—each sound layer narrows options under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: petals on wet ink become "cloud signatures," bamboo tubes spun by overtones push the raft—the final image reweights "obstacles as instruments" without moralizing, making conceptual cost undeniable through sensory transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: clouds read "like ledgers," sound "spilled outward fractal generating," and silence measured "like a conductor measures rest"—rhythmic compression taught early ("blue hour" cadence) pays off in closure's threefold repetition without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "hail of petals" simultaneously shows action consequence, notation creation, and cloud-signature metaphor; final line's "obstacle become instrument" avoids cliché through precise sonic vocabulary while accelerating momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transcends floating-orchard trope via physics of sound: "striking absence" transforms doldrums through fractal mechanics, with emotional truth in collective exhaustion ("braiding solitude into chorus") making freshness feel inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
