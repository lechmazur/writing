<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction despite strong embodied motivation; prophet’s "conversion not comfort" motive deepens through action but lacks internal friction beyond external pressure. Micro-choices under still-air crisis (striking absence, rigging tubes) reveal value hierarchy, yet emotional layering stays surface-level in high-stakes beats. Flawless integration of flaw (obsession with resonance) with closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "obstacle become instrument" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost of collective labor against stillness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds from opening sensory density to fractal escalation; orientation anchored by line 1. Cost proof evident in "thousand micro-rhythms" braiding solitude into chorus with visible physical toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard raft functions as micro-setting constraining every choice (e.g., bamboo tubes spun by sound); "blue hour" time pressure tightens tactics. Final image charged by peach tree’s F-sharp petals sticking to resonance parchment. No generic placeholders—sensory hierarchy reflects prophet’s sound-focused POV with weather/environment driving action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating Doldrum Wall) signaled immediately; escalation via density increase as silence deepens pressure. Prophet’s agency drives deepening: striking absence transforms stillness into groove with visible cost (collective heartbeat tapping). Moral calculus sharpens peak choice—turning calm into rhythm requires sacrificing individual rest for communal sound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "obstacles as instruments not yet tuned" motif reweighted at closure; no moralizing. Final line reconfigures premise with conceptual cost: silence becomes groove only through collective labor. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (e.g., fractal echoes birthing smaller echoes). Ambiguity lingers in "conversion" motive’s ethical cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: all description filtered through sound physics ("clouds moved in slow arpeggios"). Rhythmic control under pressure peaks with "restless euphony" cadence shifts. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("sketched resonance") and paid off in fractal closure. Voice modulates from precise ("alto cumuli") to visceral ("wet slap of waves").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or pressure (e.g., "petals landed on parchment... forming accidental notations"). Figurative language consistent ("cloud lyre") with no muddle in peak beats. Final line’s triplet ("obstacle become instrument...") delivers closure with crystalline propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally across short/long sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dub music theory and nautical navigation transforms tropes; "fractal generating" mechanics feel inevitable. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "children dancing, hair flicking droplets" avoids generic templates. Transformation test passed: plot fails if swapped to generic "sound device" instead of orchard-specific resonance.</comment>
