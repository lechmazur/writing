<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wild in her abundance" vs "learned to stress it") drives earned renunciation, but "intersubjective understanding" breaks character voice with diagnostic label-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost ("bitter tannins transformed by time"), but lens ambiguity in midpoint ("intersubjective understanding" phrasing) slightly weakens Accumulative/Textural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and vineyard actively constrain choice (reflection space) and charge closure ("grape-colored shadows"), satisfying 9+ gate via micro-setting that reconfigures the central metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through vineyard parallels with visible cost ("texture of loss"), but escalation lacks one tangible pressure point beyond internal realization; "bitter tannins" line makes cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("sweetness after bitter tannins") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing; theme emerges purely through vineyard struggle metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("autumn light... painted faces in shades of amber") shines, but "intersubjective understanding" violates Marcus's lexicon with academic diction during peak emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but "intersubjective understanding" triggers register drift penalty; otherwise exquisite rhythm ("vineyard breathed... patient accumulation of seasons") avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lonely caretaker" trope through specific viticulture logic; "destined mismatches" concept synthesizes character/world/theme organically without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
