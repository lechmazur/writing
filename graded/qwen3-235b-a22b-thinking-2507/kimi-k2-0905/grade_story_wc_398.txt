<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in action: Marco speaks to the letter while recognizing "the girl who no longer existed," with micro-choices (regrafting plan) earned through vineyard metaphors. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws (stubborn hope) compound choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "bus engine idled" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("destined mismatch still brave enough to call itself a harvest"). Orientation anchors by word 5; cost legible in extinguished letter ember versus internal engine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Amber pavilion functions as micro-setting charging closure: saffron light's "passionate subtlety" argues against chill while constraining his decision space. Sensory hierarchy impeccable—"crushing leaves so their scent rose like bruised herbs" mirrors memory's release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake deepening ("destined mismatch was not their love but the families’ verdict") narrows options through protagonist agency. Visible cost: letter's "final ember extinguished" versus regrafting risk. Pressure tightens via sensory accumulation, not false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting metaphor without stated morals; final image reweights "impossible" as harvestable. Elena’s voice "asking questions" offers resonant answer via soil-heart parallels—no thematic echo, only earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "autumn had coppered the vines" filters world through viticulture. Rhythmic control under pressure—"thumb against scorched filament"—avoids syntactic monotony. Single-POV flawless with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "saffron light argue against the night’s chill" does triple duty (sensory, thematic, character). Final line’s "bus engine idled" avoids closure cliché with textural specificity. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viticulture and love: "grafted so closely join becomes strongest part" transforms trope into inevitable emotional logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes via quiet closure where hope precedes the bus’s return.</comment>
