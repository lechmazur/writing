<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction ("fraud had been tender") and embodied emotion (palms itching with splint memory) powerfully drive her arc; changeling’s shrewd innocence creates authentic tension but blacksmith’s wife remains abstract motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "heart a map of bright fractures" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens shift; changeling’s dialogue slightly over-clarifies the thematic turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden setting actively constrains choices (bone-pavers path appears only when certainty fractures) and charges the final image (hedges rewoven); micro-setting of the tooth directly shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through visceral deepening (yew log fertilizing pears reframes the lie’s value) under Accumulative lens; pressure narrows options to acceptance but lacks one concrete mid-beat trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from bone-setting metaphor ("grow stronger at the angle of wounding"); final image ("mistakes become lanterns") avoids moralizing while reweighting all prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (bone-setter’s tactile focus) and rhythmic control shine in climax; "tasting chalk and thunder" risks purple prose but earns its place through character-specific urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "opalized, root curled like a fetus" exemplifies textural density; minor register drift in "nostalgic innovation" momentarily distracts from embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope through moral ambiguity (nurturing lie) and specific bone-setting lens; "fertilizing winter pears" detail creates freshness without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
