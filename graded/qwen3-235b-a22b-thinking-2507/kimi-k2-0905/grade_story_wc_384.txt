<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s vengeance/forgiveness duality, embodied through micro-choices like writing in shaky script. However, the sister’s presence remains purely reflective, lacking on-page secondary pressure to deepen relationship dynamics as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves potent Charged Poise as Mara’s blood-written confession reconfigures her stance with undeniable cost (leaving the thorn behind). Backstory reflection (≈35%) risks momentum but anchors to present cues (thorn, key) and alters her stance, meeting BRR exception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary constrains choice (writing on floor) and charges closure (blooded palm print), while the rose thorn evolves from vengeance talisman to truth-revealing tool. "Pearl twilight" repetition slightly edges toward cliché but gains specificity through aurora’s shifting light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s realization that "calibrated treason" corrupted her soul, narrowing options to self-forgiveness. Agency is clear in her blood-writing choice, with cost legible when she abandons the thorn—though the internal conflict lacks one visceral mid-beat reversal to tighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the thorn’s shifting meaning (vengeance → truth-piercing gift) and key ("prison around her heart"), avoiding moralizing. The blood-written line "I forgive the unfinished" delivers resonant non-literal closure without stating a moral, perfectly reweighting the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details ("cold marble wall," blood-matching thorn) and rhythmic control during pressure ("calibrated treason had been perfectly executed—but she’d become the very monster"). Zero head-hopping; single-POV stability intensifies emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "survival without forgiveness was merely prolonged death." Minor repetition of "pearl twilight" feels intentional rhythm rather than muddle, and closure imagery ("bloodied palm against the wall") remains razor-sharp without figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" transforms rebellion into precision artistry with moral specificity (protecting innocents while toppling regimes). Emotional truth in "forgiving the unfinished" avoids genericity, while risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence or closure impact.</comment>
