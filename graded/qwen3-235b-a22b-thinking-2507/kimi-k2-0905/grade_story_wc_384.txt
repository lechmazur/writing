<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s shift from vengeance to forgiveness, embodied through blood writing. However, "wisely enduring" remains a label without visible tradeoffs until late, slightly weakening early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: blood-written confession with palpable cost (blood, weight lifting). Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—dripping stalactites and recurring blood deepen stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary constrains choice (blood writing on floor) and charges the final image. Aurora’s "pearl twilight" evolves with emotional shifts, avoiding static description through tactile, lived-in details like thorn pricks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mara’s agency—writing in her own blood forecloses vengeance. Cost is legible in blood matching her sister’s, but "calibrated treason" concept lacks on-page tactical demonstration, slightly blurring escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through blood writing ("broken sentences in the great manuscript"), avoiding moralizing. Yet "we are all incomplete stories" risks thematic echo, though saved by concrete action over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: calligrapher’s focus on textures (marble, thorn, ink) and rhythmic control during blood writing. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via fragmented backstory cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose soars with textural specificity ("ancient rhythm," "pearl shadows"), but "become the very monster" strains toward cliché. Minor scaffold in "calibrated treason" repetition, yet closure beat remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy as treason/forgiveness ritual. Risks lyrical density but earns it through sensory coherence. Derivative "monster" line slightly undercuts originality, though core premise feels inevitable.</comment>
