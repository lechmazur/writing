<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's altruism is embodied in ghostly actions (chilling frost, balancing arches), not told; Kai's barefoot trust shows earned character dynamics. Lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments—her selflessness never wavers under pressure, missing the 9+ quick test's requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mara dissolving into the nebula while Kai's chalk message ("family is the crop") crystallizes cost and continuity. The Accumulative lens holds through escalating message density, though the "years later" shift slightly risks orientation debt without full payoff in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The watering bell constrains choice (timing harvests) and charges closure—evolving from "brambled hope" to "pure, unbrambled" release. Its tactile presence ("bronze rim still warm," "measuring rhythm like a heart") directly shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: frost messages → pigment urgency → physical balancing. Cost is unmistakable in "Mara felt the tether loosen," but escalation lacks one visceral narrowing of options—e.g., a colonist's hesitation could heighten the "tilted sky" paradox's terror for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brambled hope" reweighted by Kai's final chalk line—no moralizing. The watering bell's evolution offers a resonant answer: survival as collective verb, proven by children ringing it "so no stranger falls alone," avoiding thematic echo while charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature shines ("condensation swirling where ankles should be"), with rhythmic compression under stress ("She could not hold chalk, but chill the slate"). The "years later" shift slightly disrupts POV consistency, preventing 9.0 despite flawless voice modulation in crisis beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "clang like berries caught in wire" exemplifies textural density. Minor scaffolding in "nebula of respite" description ("violet cloud that slowed time for the grieving") risks overwriting but doesn't dull the closure image, costing 0.1 from a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" transforms ghost-story tropes through specific emotional calculus—the bell's painful beauty driving collective action. Risk-taking (ghost POV, nebula mechanics) heightens stakes coherently, with the watering bell's evolution feeling inevitable in hindsight for 9+.</comment>
