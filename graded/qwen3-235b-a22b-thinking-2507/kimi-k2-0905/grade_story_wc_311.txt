<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "only of endings" vs. sacrifice realization, but reaper's passivity during roof-split climax undermines agency. Micro-choice of shattering cylinders reveals value hierarchy, yet key epiphany lacks causal trigger beyond "memory slammed," weakening escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: ink dissolving into ledger reweights reaper's existence as debt. Orientation solid by line 3 ("ancient observatory at dusk"), but "memory slammed" lacks causal setup, creating minor escalation gap before the pivotal copper-mirror revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atlas page functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (folding into boat, dissolving monsters) and charging the final image with rising paper souls. Copper dusk and quartz dust evolve causally with events, avoiding static description through tactile integration like "boots grinding."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake "What was sacrificed for you?" tightens through reaper's cylinder-shattering agency, with unmistakable cost in brother's reflected gaze and ink writing "every soul... paid... to postpone his own." Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though observatory's reactions flirt with coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sea monsters as crystallized sacrifices become ledger of initials, answering "What was sacrificed?" non-literally via rising paper souls. Avoids moralizing; "unlived years stacked like unread letters" embodies sacrifice without abstraction, earning resonance through concrete pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("constellations crawled like silver lice"), with stress-compressed syntax ("Memory slammed... like chapel bells"). Minor register drift in "therefore forgiven" slightly dulls closure's embodied texture, but rhythmic control under pressure remains distinct and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("fingertip left frost, and the ink reacted, swelling"), but "therefore forgiven" introduces analytical abstraction in final line. No closure-impairing loops, though minor modifier stack ("swelling until... became... through which") slightly muddles one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reaper trope transformed via emotional specificity: heartbroken not grim, sacrifice as existential debt. Fresh inflection in "unlived years stacked like unread letters" synthesizes theme with character, avoiding cliché through concrete stakes (brother's accusation, ink ledger) that heighten coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
