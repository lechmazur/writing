<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Miren’s futile reach for memories (“fingers passed through”) and micro-choice to fold dust into her lantern sleeve, embodying earned endurance. Flaw: Sister’s treason lacks concrete friction complicating Miren’s present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the final “pockets of gravity fluctuating... carrying her forward” crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visceral cost (crumbled flowers, residue of silence). Whale’s removal slightly convenient but serves the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt chamber isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains movement (“steps into strange arcs”) and enables the climax (cracking crystals releasing memories). Final image’s “laughter settle into her bones” charges the environment’s thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation: gravity pockets narrow options until the dense point forms. Miren’s agency drives escalation (laying flowers, whispering date), with cost legible in the flowers’ pigment loss and crumbling—a trade-off inherent to the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through physics: “deleted memories do not vanish; they sink” becomes embodied in salt/gravity mechanics. Final image (“pockets... carrying her forward”) reweights the premise without moralizing—no thematic echo, only resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: “bruised purple of dusk,” “tasted of iron and forgetting” filter reality through Miren’s grief. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (short clauses during memory emergence), with no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels (“memories emerged like minnows” compresses emotion into image). Only microscopic flaw: “fluctuated mysteriously” slightly vague early on, but later specificity compensates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: gravity pockets as memory vessels transforms familiar concepts. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry—salt chamber’s physics feels inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
