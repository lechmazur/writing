<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (erasure vs. recovery) manifest physically through coffee grounds and gravity surges; final renunciation of tangible connection earns cost via matchbook sacrifice. No stock phrasing in peak memory confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Mael's weightless understanding of memory migration ("whale rib, salt cave, gravity’s fist") crystallizes options with conceptual cost (mother's voice as whale exhalation). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shifts in brine-dripping time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber constrains every choice—from coffee-ground divination to matchbook sacrifice—and charges the final image (scales crystallizing). Body/tool integration: lantern flame feeds on "equal-and-opposite absence" as direct environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reclaiming erased memories) tightens via gravity surges that force micro-choices: feeding matchbook to stabilize projection. Visible cost in flame distortion and petal disintegration, narrowing options toward Earned Stasis (lighting buoys without full restoration).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt crystallization as memory vessel; final image reweights "deleted memories" as migratory entities with conceptual cost (mother's voice becoming whale sound). Zero moralizing—resonance built via pigment-bleeding wildflowers and coffee-dark motes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "brine dripped from ceiling spears," "time pooled in corners like mercury." Rhythmic control under pressure ("crystals cracked, shedding shards that hovered, then rained upward") with no head-hopping. Lexicon stays maritime-lyrical ("bog-asphodel," "brine floor").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals became pixels" risks mixed metaphor but pays off as intentional memory-digital fusion. High density: "breathed on the grounds, and the missing pieces tugged at her lungs like hooks" compresses action/emotion/theme. Final line’s truncation serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms memory-loss trope via gravity physics and salt crystallization. Emotional specificity in "mother’s face smeared into fog" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (pixels in lyrical context) heightens stakes without gimmickry—cost legible in fragmented reunion.</comment>
