<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellery’s embodied grief (dust in lungs, macerating heart) and contradictory impulses—seeking connection while knowing Quinn’s gone—drive credible endurance. Micro-choices like gentler throttle adjustment reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (kneeling, frayed cord).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "tending to the unspoken" realization crystallizes stakes with felt cost (physical collapse, frayed cord). Accumulative lens holds as echo density reweights absence; cost is legible in "vibration of Quinn’s restored laughter travel through stone into his bones."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel setting constrains choice (amplifying blower into lullabies) and charges final image (concrete ribs holding mirth). Hourglass and pull-cord function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and reweight closure—"spent firework" sky mirrors constrained hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring laughter) tighten through agency: Ellery’s shift from roaring to "measured sighs" forecloses revival fantasy for earned connection. Cost is unmistakable in physical collapse and wife’s delayed chuckle—pressure coheres under accumulative lens via echo density reweighting absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: blower’s "frantic ballet" evolving into laughter-spilling wind reweights "tending absence." Final image ("house exhaled something very like a laugh") offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-particular details ("glass marble dropped onto tile" for laughter). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure: tunnel’s "sour orchestra" shifts to "rubber ball made of light" giggle, taught and paid off in final organ pipe metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "mournfully eager" handle and "frantic ballet" achieve high density without muddle. Minor overwriting in "heart macerated itself" slightly dulls tunnel climax, but final image’s "spent firework" glow sustains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via specific mechanics: blower as conduit for echo-chamber haunting. Emotional truth anchors universals—"frayed pull-cord handle" against hourglass belly" synthesizes loss into fresh, inevitable imagery without gimmickry.</comment>
