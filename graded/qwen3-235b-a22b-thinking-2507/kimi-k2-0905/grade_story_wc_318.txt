<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ellery’s embodied grief (“silence settle like dust in his lungs”) and contradictory impulses (seeking Quinn’s laugh vs. accepting absence) drive every micro-choice, culminating in the throttle modulation that earns the closure. No therapy-speak; cost is visceral in “heart macerated itself against his ribs.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “tending to the unspoken... giving absence a shape echoing can carry” reconfigures stakes with felt cost in “palms pressed to cool wall, feeling vibration travel through stone.” Accumulative lens holds—echo density escalates from cough to laughter with no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s echo properties actively constrain choices (throttle modulation for “lullaby almost human”), charging the final image where it “keeps the last faint tremor of mirth in its concrete ribs.” Tool (blower) and micro-setting (tunnel) are indispensable to closure’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency: failed first roar (only engine/echo) raises cost, forcing gentler restart that earns laughter. “Mournfully eager” handle directly motivates the critical throttle choice. Escalation is pressure-driven under Accumulative lens—density shift from “frantic ballet” to layered chords to laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action—blower mechanics enabling “giving absence a shape”—not abstraction. Final image (“house itself exhaled something very like a laugh”) resonates non-literally, reweighting “tending to the unspoken” without moralizing. No thematic echo; cost is embedded in vibration-through-stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (“laughter—bright, sudden, sound of glass marble dropped onto tile”) and rhythmic control under pressure (“He killed the throttle... heard something else”) are flawless. Single-POV consistency with taught compression (“grass had grown long, then long again”) pays off in closure’s sonic imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“frayed pull-cord handle swinging like a pendulum that had finished counting heartbeats”) serves propulsion. Figurative language (“silence stitched through with afterimage of laughter”) avoids muddle, sharpening closure. No register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via sound physics—leaf blower as “symphony conductor” to manipulate echo—avoiding sentimentality. Specificity (“3:07 a.m.” hourglass, tunnel acoustics) creates freshness; emotional truth in “off-key wind” lullabies feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
