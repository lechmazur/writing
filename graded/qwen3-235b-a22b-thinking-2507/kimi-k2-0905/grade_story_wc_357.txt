<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in memory sacrifice at sapling; embodied emotion ("boots skating across leaves") avoids labels. Micro-choices under pressure (clutching arrow during inversion) earn final endurance. Minor flaw: "loneliness of sky paths" slightly over-articulated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: memories drawn outward into collective. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to inversion climax. Cost proof solid in "her own memories drawn outward"—no explain-everything ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Water flow functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("etched the route into her reflexes") and constrains every navigation choice. Sensory hierarchy impeccable: crisis narrows to water’s "cool currents against her palms" while calmer moments admit "mossy bark" texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via gravity inversion’s live clock ("hour was only minutes away"), forcing branch-to-branch leaps. Cost crystallizes when memories flow outward—a visible forfeiture altering her state. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (arrow discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sapling’s "prism of every hardship outlived," avoiding moralizing. Final blossom exhale offers resonant non-literal answer to "where resilience comes from?" No thematic echo—Aera’s quote is earned character dialogue, not author intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "every leaf hummed with the same low question" filters world through Aera’s obsession. Rhythm modulates perfectly—"rivers loosened into spirals" compresses diction under stress while "whirling silence" stretches cadence for reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "buds unfurled into blossoms... withered in heartbeat" achieves triple duty. Figurative language precise ("silver threads of water climbing like music scores") without muddle. Minor deduction: "ticking" slightly mechanical but justified by "reciprocal graft" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through ecological specificity: resilience as "willing transfer across inversions" avoids safety middle. Fresh inflection in gravity inversion as metaphor for communal endurance. Emotional truth in memory sacrifice outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
