<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection, curiosity vs. fear) drive her micro-choices under pressure, notably reading the phrasebook despite shaking knees. Mother’s backstory anchors her motivation without flattening tension, though Captain Rooth’s abrupt shift lacks prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "currents of shared light" reconfigures sociable isolation after the ship’s survival hinges on storytelling. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern alignment (starlings/hopscotch), though the chief’s "tale bright enough to burn" slightly flattens subtext.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The hopscotch board (micro-setting) constrains choice and charges closure—Lira’s copied spirals directly enable the new route. Dust, grates, and copper veins pressure actions organically, avoiding static description; the final "after-image of hope" reweights the motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: dimming lights narrow options to language-as-fuel, with visceral cost (knees shaking, risk of rejection). The "stranded luminance" concept changes tactics, though the chief’s exposition slightly undermines accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "light remembers its way home" reweights into cartographic salvation without moralizing. Final image ("after-image of hope") offers resonant, non-literal answer to language’s power, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("coastlines official maps insisted did not exist") and rhythmic control under pressure ("spilled ink around her boots"). Stable POV with intentional compression; dialogue sparse but subtextual (chief’s grunt revealing engineering futility).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flour-fine dust" and "trapped fireflies" exemplify textural specificity. Final line recharges "stranded luminance" with propulsion. Minor register drift in "star-cold" but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking/linguistics transforms airship trope—starlings as navigational patterns, not mere atmosphere. Emotional specificity in Lira’s quiet resolve avoids abstraction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
