<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority shines via concrete details (dust-blown spirals, mother’s dog-ear), but contradictions lack depth—her sociable isolation isn’t tested under pressure until the climax, missing micro-choices that could heighten stakes earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (crew unity, lights reigniting), but cost legibility falters: the ship’s near-loss lacks visceral consequence beyond "shadows pooled," missing a tangible price for the resolution despite strong lens coherence (Accumulative/Textural).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the hopscotch board’s dust patterns constrain Lira’s actions and charge the final image ("after-image of hope"), with brass ribs and starlings evolving causally to mirror her arc—environment as active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lira’s agency (reading the phrasebook), but the cost remains abstract—no specific loss (e.g., the dog-ear’s sacrifice) alters tactics, weakening escalation’s felt weight despite the luminance crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "light remembers its way home" reweights into communal hope without moralizing, with the starling pattern’s dissolution offering a resonant, non-literal answer to language/landscape unity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("diligently curious fingers," flour-fine dust) and rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance shifts subtly when Lira aligns spirals with the phrasebook, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion—"copper arteries" surging with light avoids figurative muddle, but "flour-fine dust" edges toward thesaurus-itis, slightly diluting momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic cartography and airship mechanics feels inevitable; risk-taking (story as fuel) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "stranded luminance" concept slightly echoes existing tropes.</comment>
