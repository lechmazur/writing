<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vendor's embodied contradictions shine (e.g., weighing absence while becoming door), but librarian's transformation lacks causal setup; micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchies, though secondary character depth falters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: vendor becoming the door reframes creation with undeniable cost ("customers stepped through her"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through escalating quantification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices—crystal fruit syllables enable prologue projections, obsidian cracks dictate table placement; micro-setting (bottles/scales) charges the final image of dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density: each transaction deepens the orchard's weight until "floorplate dip"; cost is unmistakable in vendor's self-erasure, driven entirely by her agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "stories begin where memory ends" crystallizes in shattered parole rearranging into first sentence—no moralizing, pure resonant subtext charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature mastery: "brass doors exhaled," "clouds writing dedications" filter world through vendor's quantifying lens; rhythm modulates perfectly under stress (librarian confrontation's clipped cadence).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "sigh on left pan; right pan rose like balloon" compresses emotion/action; final line's propulsion ("dare to begin") recharges motifs without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: "cracked marble, pressed violet" makes absence tangible; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned closure image.</comment>
