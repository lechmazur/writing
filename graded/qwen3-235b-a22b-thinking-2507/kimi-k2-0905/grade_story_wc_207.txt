<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ivy’s shift from collector to hinge; embodied emotion in buckling knees and upward-rain ritual avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of identity earned through vial-release cost, though secondary pressure absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: compass dissolution into second heart reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("hinge herself"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds via vial-counting to lagoon’s hushed payoff, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Limestone cliffs and vials constrain every choice; lagoon’s "powdered shell" beach charges the final image as petrichor coalesces. Sensory hierarchy—smell dominant, touch vital—mirrors Ivy’s embodied focus without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where explanations fail) tightens via compass visions, but lagoon’s "tribute" demand lacks visceral escalation. Cost—sacrificing collection identity—is legible yet under-pressured; one deepening (vial release) suffices but feels slightly detached from physical stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vials as vessels of possibility: final upward-rain reweights "petrichor" from memory to active hope without moralizing. "Terror arrived, then politeness excused it" crystallizes complex acceptance—no tidy resolution, only earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "scent of first rain on stone" filtered through collector’s obsession. Rhythmic control peaks in lagoon sequence—"hinged awakenings" syntax fractures then resolves. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion immaculate; "fossil confetti" and "neon bled" compress meaning. Minor density issue: "psychometry might work" slightly clinical in high-pressure beat. No loops—vial repetitions serve accumulation without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "collector" trope through petrichor-as-potential; lagoon’s silent consumption of breaths feels fresh. Risk-taking (upward rain, brass heart) heightens stakes coherently. Avoids safety middle—explanations failing isn’t resolved, only embodied.</comment>
