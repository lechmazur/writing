<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (forgetting safety vs memory pain) drive the pivotal scalpel choice; embodied micro-choices like slicing the mushroom reveal value hierarchy. Slightly over-tidy epiphany about "habits are stories" edges toward tell, reducing 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: refusal to forget carries visible cost (greenhouse shuddering, ring withering). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the sextant reflection. Cost proof undeniable in "fairy ring already withering into harmless moss".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices—ship ribs frame the sextant, mushroom glow guides her path. The sextant's seven shards charge the final image by reflecting her ages. Micro-setting (tool) essential to closure logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: detecting bruises forces the sextant confrontation. Cost is visceral in the shuddering greenhouse and withering ring. Internal conflict (safety of forgetting vs pain of remembering) could deepen the climax tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: crossed-out mushroom drawing replaced by mother's hand offering rain. Final image ("sweet with tannic edge") answers "memory vs forgetting" without moralizing. "Curiosity is memory finding its way home" borders on thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: folklorist's eye for "bruises on the cap" and "Pleiades tincture." Rhythm modulates perfectly—short sentences for tension ("She snapped on a headlamp"), lyrical flow for reflection. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via journal fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-crystal leaves" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-flawless propulsion until "crisp nostalgia" in climax—a slight abstraction that dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure closure. Prevents 9.5+ despite otherwise exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fungal memory recovery via folklorist's lens avoids cliché. Risk-taking (Pleiades-as-mushroom-bruises) heightens stakes coherently. Transformation test passed—the story fails if "folklorist" becomes generic "researcher," proving specificity's necessity.</comment>
