<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s choice to slice the mushroom versus pressing the sextant, embodying "safety of forgetting over pain of loss." Slight over-reliance on thematic labels ("chronically curious ache") nudges down from 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: slicing the mushroom triggers shuddering greenhouse, realigned stars, and returned memories with visceral cost ("pear butter on burnt toast"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken orchard actively constrains choices—ship ribs force posture, water surface reflects constellations—but "crisp nostalgia" as sensory detail feels abstract. Sextant shards charging the final image elevates to near-9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize late: dominant conflict (memory vs. forgetting) tightens meaningfully at the sextant, but "habitual surrender" concept lacks early dramatization. Cost is undeniable in regained memories, yet escalation feels slightly delayed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "curiosity is memory finding its way home" crystallizes through actions (slicing mushroom, drawing mother’s hand), avoiding moralizing. Final image (singing to stars) reweights raincoat memory with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-crystal leaves," "accordion’s last chord") modulates perfectly under pressure. Rhythm shifts from lyrical to urgent when lifting the sextant; no POV leaks or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "Pleiades tincture—return journey" does triple duty. One minor abstraction ("chronically curious ache") prevents 9.0, but zero loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes via folklorist lens: upside-down orchard feels fresh, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, but "habitual surrender" lacks the specificity to hit 9.0.</comment>
