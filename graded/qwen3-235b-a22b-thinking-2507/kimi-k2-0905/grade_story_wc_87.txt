<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "latitude by longing, longitude by loss" mantra and micro-choices like paddling toward shoals; embodied regret as "cold thread tugging outward" avoids diagnostic labels. Slight abstraction in "merrily melancholic" concept edges toward thematic echo but stays grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "regret’s backlash loosened its grip, transformed into forward motion" crystallizes stance with felt consequence. Orientation perfect within 120 words; Accumulative lens holds through pole-light pattern evolution to bioluminescent dolphins guiding her into the "widening yes".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astronomical compass functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (sliding causes drysuit gash) and charges closure pressed "like a stethoscope." Pole lights evolve from navigation tools to "prayers offered by electricians," but coastal setting lacks deeper tactile engagement beyond visual cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when fog erases poles, forcing navigation by "echo of their hum" despite shoal warnings. Escalation driven by agency (choosing poles over charts), but cost feels slightly abstract—drysuit gash and torn charts lack tangible consequence escalation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "flickering faith is still faith as long as the hand keeps moving" and tearing charts into confetti. Final image "widening yes" reweights navigation as acceptance without moralizing, though "merrily melancholic" borders on thematic echo without full integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "pole lamps pulsed a different color—amber, white, sickly sodium orange" and water’s Morse code. Rhythmic control shines during motorboat wake ("She laughed then..."), but "merrily melancholic" phrasing repeats with slight register drift in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via dense lines like "cold water kissed the skin beneath, a baptism administered by the same sea." Final "widening yes" recharges "flickering faith" motif flawlessly, though "merrily melancholic" repetition approaches overuse without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Utility poles as constellations transform navigation tropes through specific, grounded choices ("sickly sodium orange," blinking patterns). Emotional truth anchors universals via kayak’s "Morse that spelled maybe," but "broken navigator" archetype leans familiar without radical reinvention.</comment>
