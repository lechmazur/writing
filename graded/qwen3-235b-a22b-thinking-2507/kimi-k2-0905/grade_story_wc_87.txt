<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("safe channel instead of true one") and embodied regret ("cold thread tugging outward") power micro-choices like turning toward shoals. Final renunciation of charts earns closure through prior causality, though secondary character (absent lover) lacks on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: compass pressed to chest listening for "new rhythm" crystallizes stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. "Water slapped the hull in Morse" deepens pressure via cadence shift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain navigation choices and charge the final image ("paddled by echo of their hum"). Compass gash from motorboat wake alters tactics via micro-setting, while bioluminescent dolphins transform the coastal launch into active guidance system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating brokenness) tightens through protagonist agency: ignoring shoals chart to follow pole lights forces trade-off between safety and authenticity. Cost legible in "tear the charts into confetti" renunciation, with dolphins embodying earned shift in options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "latitude by longing, longitude by loss" evolves from mantra to lived truth. Final image ("kayak moved steady... into widening yes") reweights navigation metaphor without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: navigator sees pole lights as "constellations invented by merrily melancholic god." Rhythmic control under pressure ("maybe, maybe... yes, yes") modulates with emotional intensity; zero head-hopping in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "Morse that spelled maybe" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-loop ("flickering faith" repetition) justified by evolution from paddle blades to philosophical stance, enhancing rather than obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "broken navigator" trope through specific mechanics (astronomical compass, utility pole navigation). Emotional truth in "pain is just another form of percussion" avoids generic templates, though risk-taking stops short of radical structural innovation.</comment>
