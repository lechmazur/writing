<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (scientific control vs. linden defiance), but the final surrender lacks layered micro-choices in peak pressure—her shift to acceptance reads as epiphany rather than earned struggle with visible tradeoffs in the decisive moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: her surrender forecloses control with visceral cost (skin splitting, rooted legs), but the transition from shock to release feels slightly rushed in the climax, missing one tightening beat of resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mossy trellis actively constrains choices (catching her fall) and charges the final image (becoming "plant and architecture"), while linden leaves' silver veins directly shape the transformation's mechanics—micro-setting flawlessly integrates with closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (control vs. surrender) escalate through Mira's agency: clipping the leaf triggers the crisis, and her laughter at the sprinklers crystallizes the thematic shift with felt cost—pressure narrows options relentlessly under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (pH meters rendered meaningless), not moralizing; the final image—"reconstruction into something that understood growth required surrender"—resonates as a non-literal answer to control vs. relationship without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("laughter like wind through hollow bamboo"), but "circuitously sincere" momentarily drifts into academic diction during transformation, slightly clashing with her stressed POV lexicon despite strong rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels ("lightning spider-webbed"), yet "brutal honesty of a plant forced to grow around a fence post" slightly over-explains the metaphor in a high-pressure beat, muddying otherwise crystalline prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "plant horror" tropes via scientific specificity (pruning shears scar, nutrient cycles); emotional truth in "roots pushing through compacted earth" avoids cliché, with risk-taking (ugly metamorphosis) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
