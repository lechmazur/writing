<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "approach without desperation" vs scar history creates credible tension; embodied emotion through porcelain reflection and scar reveal. Micro-choices like indirect star-gazing preserve wisdom without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: wisdom stabilized but walker must depart, cost legible in "scar reminder" and "footsteps faded." Accumulative lens holds through kinetic parapet's rhythm synchronizing with heartbeat until dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (kinetic parapet) constrains choice: stone grinding dictates walking pace and anchors final heartbeat image. Sensory details like "trapped moths" whispers and porcelain moon-reflection charge closure without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: walking perimeter three times evolves into consecration method. Cost crystallizes in scar's origin and dawn's "footsteps faded," reweighting wisdom preservation as fragile, ongoing labor rather than victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "space between thoughts" reframes wisdom beyond language. Final image of parapet's heartbeat reweights "silence as teacher" without moralizing, resisting tidy resolution through enduring fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "peripheral awareness" framing; rhythm modulates from deliberate steps to dawn's stabilization. No head-hopping despite prophet's offstage presence, voice stays embodied in tactile details like "gloved hand against shifting stones."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with lines like "paradox of movement beneath stillness" doing triple duty. Final line’s "steady rhythm beneath dunes" avoids figurative muddle while recharging the parapet’s meaning as wisdom’s anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics: "conjured clearing" as cognitive distortion not physical space. Bold risk in making silence the active teacher, with kinetic parapet’s hum as unconventional but coherent closure image.</comment>
