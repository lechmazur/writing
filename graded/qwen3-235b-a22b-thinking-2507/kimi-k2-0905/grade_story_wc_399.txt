<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority via scar and peripheral awareness shows embodied conflict, but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; preservation drive remains singular without competing wants that deepen stakes during consecration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with scar as visible cost, but prophet’s abrupt departure undermines causal escalation; disorientation pays off thematically yet weakens pressure coherence in the kinetic parapet sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet constrains movement and charges the final heartbeat image; sand-shifting stones force tactile navigation that evolves with consecration, making environment indispensable to closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the clearing’s manifestation and consecration ritual, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the walker follows tradition rather than adapting tactics under pressure, muting cost visibility until the scar reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of wisdom preserved beneath sands reweights "conjured clearings" as non-physical spaces without moralizing; scar and parapet’s rhythm embody the cost of preservation, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of "peripheral awareness" creates distinct rhythm and selective detail, though minor filter verbs ("he detected") dilute immediacy during high-pressure consecration beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "truth could manifest without corruption of worldly noise" slightly paraphrases "wisdom's echo faded forever," creating micro-redundancy that dulls the clearing’s manifestation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Conjured clearings" as mental spaces transforms wisdom tropes through peripheral awareness mechanics, though prophet archetype risks derivativeness without deeper moral calculus in the walker’s choices.</comment>
