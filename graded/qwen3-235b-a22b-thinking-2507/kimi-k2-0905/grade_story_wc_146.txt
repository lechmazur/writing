<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action (e.g., fork tugging at "hollow inside his chest") avoids therapy-speak, but Elian's singular focus lacks contradictory impulses during climax; the child-rescue backstory informs motivation yet remains summarized rather than dramatized with micro-choices under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Elian’s transparency and sacrifice crystallize the stakes, with the final image ("swaying slightly whenever the wind remembered to walk heel-toe") reweighting the premise through rhythm. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly as density intensifies via the seven circuits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cobblestones and tuning fork function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (e.g., footsteps charging the fork) and charges the final image; sensory details like "bruised clanks" and "stained glass flew in shards" are selective, purpose-driven, and evolve causally with the town’s restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elian’s agency (seven circuits escalating the fork’s resonance), with the north ward’s imbalance creating a visible cost that forces his sacrificial offering. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the "unspoken guilt" resolution leans slightly on coincidence rather than deepening his prior choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rhythm-as-restoration, avoiding moralizing; the final line ("echoing longer than silence dares to stay") offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from concrete particulars like bellflowers blooming with "heartbeat of a man who had waited lifetimes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("silence... coiling through sagging roofs like smoke that had forgotten how to rise"), with rhythmic control mirroring Elian’s pace. Minor POV slippage occurs during the town’s revival ("windows trembled... shutters swung") as it briefly exceeds his focalization without clear psychic distance shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion, but "vacuum begging to be filled" introduces borderline anthropomorphism that slightly muddles physical logic in a high-pressure beat. Template cadence ("heel-toe, heel-toe") is taught and pays off, yet the final paragraph’s lyrical compression risks overwriting with "echoing longer than silence dares to stay."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town tropes through the specific Tempris framework and rhythm-based mechanics; the "tenth bell" synthesis feels inevitable. Bold risk-taking (e.g., silent fork vibrations as pressure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by verifiable details like basalt pavers laid by pilgrims.</comment>
