<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete sensory loss ("hollow inside his chest where his own bell once hung"); micro-choices like the seven circuits reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in final sacrifice. No secondary pressure weakens but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (Elian's transparency) under Accumulative lens; "unspoken guilt" in north ward creates meaningful deepening. Orientation perfect within 40 words via "ancient archway of Viremont" and predawn hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobblestones function as micro-setting constraining all action (heel-toe rhythm); final image ("wind remembered to walk heel-toe") charges closure. Dust-to-spirits transformation exemplifies environment charging rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through seven circuits (one meaningful deepening); agency-driven escalation ("offered that private rhythm") makes north ward imbalance's cost legible. "Unspoken guilt" raises conceptual price without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rhythm mechanics ("footsteps on cobblestones"), not statement; final image reweights "shared balance" as wind's heel-toe sway without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "bellflower sprouted, blooming open to reveal tiny clappers".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "hush so complete it felt alive, coiling through sagging roofs"; rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("fork brightened from matte black to lacquer gloss"). Zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Bruised clanks" exemplifies textural specificity; no loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for "conceptual cost" abstraction in north ward section, but figurative language serves momentum throughout climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell tuning as architecture ("memories becoming architecture, cartilage knitting bone"); transforms ghost town trope via rhythm mechanics. Emotional truth in Elian's sacrifice avoids safety-hedging.</comment>
