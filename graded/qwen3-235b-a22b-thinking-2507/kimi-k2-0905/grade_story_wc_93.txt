<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied motivation (fulfilling Mira’s dying request) drives micro-choices like rock placement distances. Contradictory impulses—helpless witness yet active ritualist—culminate in earned renunciation: "the promise had never been about understanding." Mira’s absence avoids tokenism; her geometry maps the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias witnesses eels dissolving into constellations, cost legible in "the eel dissolved into light" and "pouch, now light as the promise." Accumulative lens holds—each rock placement tightens mathematical pressure toward the star dust’s eruption. No causality breaks; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal bluff’s friction-less physics constrains choices (barefoot stability, tide’s reach for rock placement) and charges closure via eels swimming "through the air itself." Micro-setting (painted rocks) dictates tactics; "borrowed dawn" aurora evolves from opener to fading backdrop. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill Mira’s promise) tightens through Elias’s agency: rock sequences narrow options until the star dust sings. Cost is undeniable—"eel dissolved into light" reweights the promise. Pressure escalates via mathematical precision under accumulative lens; coincidence (aurora) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: rocks, eels, and star dust reconfigure "understanding" into "witnessing." Final line—"Some promises are meant to be broken by understanding"—resonates without moralizing. No thematic echo; Mira’s death as "final pattern" embraces complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elias notices "slickness of rocks" and "crystal ringing" amid stress. Voice modulates from lyrical ("borrowed dawn") to urgent ("The ninth rock clicked"). Zero head-hopping; rhythm accelerates during rock placement. Only flaw: "precognitively cursed" slightly clinical for peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythmically ("ochre, indigo, vermillion" vs. "The sequence would harness..."). Every image serves closure: star dust’s "heat that defied cold wind" becomes constellation. Final line recharges "borrowed dawn" with devastating economy. One comma splice near midpoint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: eel herder as mathematical ritualist, "precognition" curse subverted (he witnesses but can’t change). Friction-less physics enables eels-in-air climax. Emotional truth in promise’s reframing avoids gimmickry. Risk-taking (math sequences as plot engine) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
