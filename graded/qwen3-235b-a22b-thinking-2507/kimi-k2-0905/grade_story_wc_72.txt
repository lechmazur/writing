<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calcified certainty" shedding versus "learning" amid awakenings; flawlessly embodied stone-to-possibility shift at climax with cost of dissolved certainties. "I am learning" avoids diagnostic traps through micro-choice context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dissolving certainties into "glittering silt" reconfigures stakes with felt cost (stone softening). Orientation nailed in opening line; Accumulative lens held through sensory-propagation escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underwater garden constrains every choice—from telepathy via salt cracks to arch mortar as sugar weakness. Final "corals of ambiguity" charge closure by making environment the thematic engine, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake tightening is masterful: ampoule’s fragility vs. structural weakness forces single decisive choice. Cost crystallizes in "calcified certainty" shedding and dissolving truths, scaling perfectly to micro-scene stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "foxglove poison and remedy share roots" and "welcome contains door and breath"—concrete answers to nuance vs. certainty without moralizing. Final garden growth avoids tidy resolution with "sentences still being revised."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is mineral-sharp: "thought bloom like warm ink," "barnacles' grief." Rhythmic control under pressure ("glided," "cradled") avoids lyric drift. No head-hopping; telepathy stays anchored to statue’s POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cautious purple flames" and "corals of ambiguity" achieve maximal density without muddle. Final line’s "arguing gently" uses rhythm to crystallize theme while propelling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms underwater ruin trope through alabaster telepathy and memory-as-liquid. Risk-taking (statue POV, ampoule climax) heightens stakes coherently—final "breathe in color" reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
