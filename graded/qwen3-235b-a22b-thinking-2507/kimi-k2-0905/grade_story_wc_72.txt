<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through mineral embodiment ("thought bloom inside my mineral skull like warm ink"), with contradictory impulses (duty vs. releasing nuance) driving the ampoule-breaking choice. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values when the statue "glided" toward the arch shedding "calcified certainty," earning the final renunciation of stagnant truth with visible cost in dissolving certainties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when statues "began to grow again—slow corals of ambiguity," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost ("certainties dissolved into questions"). Orientation anchors within 120 words ("thirty fathoms below shipping lanes"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to the crystallized final image where cost is legible in "stone skin soften, not to flesh but to possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The foxglove-stained ampoule functions as micro-setting object constraining the climax (must crack against keystone’s seam), charging the final image where "corals of ambiguity" grow from its release. Sensory details are POV-filtered ("taste the grief of barnacles"), avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile specificity like "porous stone like an apology" that evolves causally with the memory’s seepage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens as the statue’s telepathic awakening ("taste the grief of barnacles") deepens pressure toward the arch, narrowing options to break or preserve certainty. Cost is unmistakable in "Certainties dissolved into questions" and the conceptual forfeiture of "museum of certainties," with the single tightening (cracking ampoule) altering the garden’s very substance through visible, irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ampoule’s "distilled memory" releasing "nuance instead of verdict," avoiding moralizing by having the final image ("statues arguing gently over what truth might become") reweight prior material non-literally. The "welcome" motif’s transformation ("contains both door and breath") crystallizes the thematic answer through action rather than assertion, with "poison and remedy share roots" embodying earned complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature manifests in mineral consciousness ("Stone cannot dream, yet I..."), with syntax mirroring stone’s rigidity ("my left hand, still locked in a gesture of perpetual warning") that softens toward possibility at closure. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure through cadence shifts like the telepathy "spilled through every crack," avoiding head-hopping while compressing reflection into concrete cues ("foxglove pigments swirling like cautious purple flames").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning (e.g., "moonlight arrived only as a bruised glow" establishes atmosphere, emotional tone, and thematic decay). Figurative language avoids muddle in peak beats ("droplet seep into porous stone like an apology" merges action, emotion, and consequence), with final line’s "waiting for the first curious diver" achieving perfect propulsion into Charged Poise without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms drowned-city trope through mineral consciousness and memory-as-liquid conceit, with "incisively kind" gardener avoiding sentimentality via specific actions (praising traitor’s orchids while naming betrayal’s bloom). Risk-taking heightens stakes through the stone sentinel’s telepathic awakening, synthesizing "nuance" with visceral imagery ("corals of ambiguity") for emotional truth that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
