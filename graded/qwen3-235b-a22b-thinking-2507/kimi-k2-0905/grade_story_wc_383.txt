<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skeptic embracing haunting) powers agency; embodied cost in color sacrifice makes "translate isolation into independence" visceral and earned. Only minor slip: "tragically radiant" label lacks contradictory layer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density-driven pressure; closure (grayscale vision, blooming archive) delivers undeniable cost. Minor orientation risk in abstract "resonance structures" mechanics, but garden's physicality anchors escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains every choice (path narrowing, pond interaction) and charges final image as living archive. "Leaves soft as funeral clothes" establishes sensory bias; micro-setting essential to closure's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Mara's agency (humming lullaby despite cost); color sacrifice reweights options decisively. Tightening via sensory density (petals unfolding, vision draining) perfectly suits Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (archiving via resonance), not statement; final image of communal lullaby in strangers' throats delivers non-literal answer to isolation. Zero moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "contagious" memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trespassing inside a bruise," "black as vinyl") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to clipped during color loss. No head-hopping; voice remains Mara-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "syrup-thick twilight" to "clinked against metal like a period" shows rhythmic propulsion. Only hairline slip: "tragically radiant" repetition slightly dilutes final image's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory-quarantine trope through resonant physics and color-cost mechanic; emotional specificity in "ghostly resolve of archived citizens" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
