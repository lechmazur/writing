<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied choices (tracing warm ticket, silent withdrawal) but Rico/Jun lack distinct flaws; secondary pressure remains underdeveloped despite strong micro-choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: film projection reconfigures mistrust with undeniable cost ("funeral march for resentment"); Accumulative lens held cohesively through sensory accumulation to earned stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as active micro-setting—exit sign location pressures Mira's discovery; final sweeping image charges the space with renewed relational weight, fulfilling 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (thawing mistrust) tightens through Mira's agency in projecting the film, but escalation lacks visceral cost escalation; "heart drumming a funeral march" implies cost yet doesn't fully charge tactics pre-closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "letting both go" and open lock doodle reweight truth without moralizing; final sweeping image offers resonant non-literal answer to secrecy's cost, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("rain unbuttoning sky," dust as plankton) with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "ambiguously clear weight of trust" slightly overwrites interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density ("cryptic doodles tugged at her, ambiguously clear"); deduction for "funeral march" cliché in high-stakes beat slightly dulls emotional specificity near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope via projector lens motif and "ambiguously clear" specificity; risk-taking in quiet resolution pays off through earned emotional complexity without gimmickry.</comment>
