<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s thumb tracing warm paper versus rational duty, with embodied cost ("heart drumming funeral march"). Rico/Jun’s off-page pressure reveals status dynamics cleanly. Slight underdevelopment in secondary characters’ motives caps near 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: film projection reconfigures mistrust with visible cost (wet marble screen, swept floors). Hybrid lens (causal scavenger hunt + accumulative texture) holds through "I’m letting both go." Orientation anchored by "crystal whispering forecourt" in line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices (rain enables film projection on wet marble) and charges closure. Lens-as-tool constrains tactics (must find it to thread reel). Final image ("rain washed walls farther apart") reweights setting with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (mistrust vs truth) tighten when eavesdropping reveals the prank’s accidental gravity. Mira’s agency drives escalation ("almost stepped out... phrase freed by honesty cooled her"). Cost is visceral—resonant hush shifting from "snow fall upward" to "chord resolved" crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through projector light: "silent film speak the apology no sentence could carry." Avoids moralizing; "open lock" doodle reweights secrecy without stating morals. Final image (sweeping floors together) answers central question through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "paper still warm," "rainwater threading crystal pillars." Voice modulates under pressure ("voice soft as wet gravel"). Minor deduction for slightly elevated "resonant hush" repetition, but diction stays character-bound through crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "plankton in torch beam" fresh without muddle. Deducted for two minor loops: "ambiguously clear" repetition and "resonant hush" overuse in closure beat. Final line avoids sentimentality via concrete setup ("cloak that fit at last").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms workplace trope through projector lens metaphor—fresh inflection where honesty literally projects memory. Emotional specificity ("fear of staying frozen") avoids cliché. Bold quiet closure risks sentimentality but earns weight through wet marble screen and swept floors.</comment>
