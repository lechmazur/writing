<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) drive every micro-choice with embodied cost; "methodical care" folding pages reveals her nature while advancing the plot. Final renunciation of servant identity is earned through cumulative tactile decisions, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "watering the future with melted ice" crystallizes Lira’s stance shift with visible cost (abandoning laundry duties). Accumulative lens holds—each sensory detail tightens the joy/sorrow stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire constrains every choice (elevator ascent, frozen dome) and charges closure: "melted ice" watering the seed reweights the opening "icebound" imagery. Goggles function as micro-setting that alters tactics, hitting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (joy beneath sorrow) deepens through Lira’s agency: trading thimble for coal ash shows tangible cost. Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure—cipher to musical staff to seed planting—reweights options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "roots drinking heat from the planet’s molten sigh" reframes sorrow without moralizing. Final image reweights "ascending" as organic growth, offering resonant non-literal answer to grief’s containment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "frost-lensed heartbeat" filters setting through Lira’s urgency. Rhythmic control under pressure—"pages lifted, rearranged themselves"—avoids syntactic monotony while maintaining voice consistency through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "snow drifted... like a soft apology" layers atmosphere and emotion without scaffold. Final line’s "melted ice" echoes opening with purposeful repetition, avoiding figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: suicide "wager" becomes seed-scattering; "encrypted diary" yields music, not clues. Emotional specificity ("major chord, tentative as sunrise") avoids sentimentality while synthesizing grief/joy into organic growth.</comment>
