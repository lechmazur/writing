<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s inquisitive nature manifests in concrete micro-choices (tracing cipher, planting seed) with embodied emotion; final renunciation of servant role earned through causality. Minor flaw: duke’s son interaction slightly convenient for thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—Lira abandons ascent for planting, reconfiguring stakes through the seed’s "optimistic punctuation." Orientation clear by 80 words; accumulative lens holds through sensory tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively constrains choices (elevator climb, frozen dome); goggles function as micro-setting charging the final image where light "dances across walls like children chasing geese," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (joy within sorrow) signaled early; accumulative escalation via sensory accumulation (bergamot/oil scent → coal ash → apricot scent) deepens knowledge with visible cost—abandoning servant duties for planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (water-stain "laughing mouth," seed as "optimistic punctuation"); final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality via "joy disguised as ornament."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost-lensed heartbeat," "laughter stored like a bulb") with rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping. Elision (elevator transitions) taught early and paid off in closure’s humid hothouse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("She traced them: concentric circles..."). Figurative language serves meaning ("roots drinking heat from the planet’s molten sigh") without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms servant trope through specific mechanics (diary decrypted via light refraction); "joy smuggled into sorrow’s fortress" angle feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
