<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief manifests through lantern-maker habits ("pocketed one leaf out of habit"). Contradictory impulses—preserving daughter's breath yet folding it away—compel the ritual. Final choice to burn her own dream is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "luminous torment" eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 1 ("lantern maker’s hands... levitating stones"). Accumulative lens holds: each sensory detail (chiming tea leaves, glass-bead footsteps) accumulates pressure toward the ritual. Closure is Charged Poise—the cranes as "living lanterns" reconfigure grief's meaning with undeniable cost in the crumbling moonstone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The moonstone constrains choice (cracked equator forcing breath-based ritual) and charges closure (crumbles to dust "smelled of lavender and antiseptic"). Micro-setting—the gem-polishing method—directly shapes the final image, transforming grief into origami with "ribs holding a galaxy." No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately: transforming "daughter’s last breath" before grief hardens. Escalation driven by protagonist agency—each fold embodies "a day she arrived too late"—under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: "luminous torment" eyes deepen as sorrow lines erase, culminating in moonstone’s collapse that "met sorrow for the season."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: grief as "another kind of flame," origami as "syllables of goodbye." Final image—"hands smelled only of tea"—resonantly answers "can grief be transformed?" without moralizing. Avoids false balance; the "luminous torment" rejects tidy resolution while honoring maternal loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is lantern-maker specific: notices fuel potential in tea leaves, measures dawn in "recorded dream." Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato during ritual ("breathed once, twice"), flowing in calmer moments. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays tightly controlled through "translucent ribs holding a galaxy."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence does triple duty (e.g., "stepped onto levitating stones... shadow detached like reluctant twin" establishes motion, rules, and grief). Figurative language precise ("grief hardened into obsidian"). Final line recharges opening motif with devastating economy: "hands smelled only of tea."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through craft-specific logic: gem-polishing method applied to moonstone, "luminous torment" as lantern-maker’s emotional state. Floating islands aren’t decorative—they enforce the "descend while ascending" constraint that charges the ritual. Risk-taking (dream-as-quartz) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
