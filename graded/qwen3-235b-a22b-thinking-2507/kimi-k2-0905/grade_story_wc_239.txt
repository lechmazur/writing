<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite embodied actions; "cartographer of endings" backstory told not shown. Micro-choices like stepping patterns reveal value hierarchy but emotional contradiction lacks visceral texture. Final renunciation of linear identity earns cost but feels intellectualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds through dictionary transformations until Charged Poise closure ("pure notation... here, the curve unifies"). Orientation taught immediately via "cracked basalt column," cost crystallized in name-erasure. Only minor deduction for motivation's abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Temple library functions as micro-setting: stepping patterns constrain movement, singing shelves alter tactics. Dictionary-as-tool charges final image ("ants of ink marching"). "Pregnant universe" cover bulge shows tactile specificity, though "resounding hush" occasionally drifts toward generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling illusions) tightens via dictionary's evolution, but pressure escalates abstractly until late concrete cost (name erasure). Spiral arbitration rules deepen stakes effectively, though "cosmic illusions" framing lacks embodied immediacy until final dictionary transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "end is the spiral's still center" reweights all prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical weight; "pregnant universe" metaphor earns conceptual cost. Final image transforms "hiccup" into unified curve with undeniable resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of starlight and dust") shines, but rhythm stumbles in abstract passages ("centrifugal yearning equals centripetal truth"). Controlled elision works, yet three consecutive "walking" phrases in climax disrupt pressure. Absence of dialogue irrelevant per policy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density, but "corkscrew off the page" creates subtle metaphor clash. Three "walking" repetitions in pivotal beat risk template cadence. No closure artifacts; "ants of ink marching" shows exceptional textural specificity despite minor lyrical excesses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic clichés through specific mechanics: spiral arbitration rules feel inevitable, dictionary's evolution synthesizes premise organically. "Wanderingly exact" trait avoids quirkiness by constraining stepping patterns. Bold structural risk (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
