<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "naked motivation" triggers diagnostic label penalty. Strength: cartographer past informs spiral navigation choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("memories slide into dictionary"). Lens ambiguity resolved by midpoint; hiccup timeframe creates pressure for final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library constrains choices (shelves bowing/singing), dictionary charges final image. Generic phrases like "resounding hush" slightly weaken specificity despite strong micro-setting use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through dictionary's transformation; cost legible in memory surrender. "Cosmic illusions" remains slightly abstract but redeemed by visceral memory arbitration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spiral mechanics, not moralizing. Final line "here, the curve unifies" reweights everything without stating moral, passing Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of starlight"), rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "spiral arbitration" nearly triggers artifact penalty but taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ants of ink marching" shows concrete action. Near-purple prose in "captive moths" saved by context. Final line achieves perfect textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic trope via concrete mechanics (7-3-2 pattern). "Spiral arbitration" avoids abstraction through spatial cost. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
