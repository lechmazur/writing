<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines through concrete choices (coaxing lavender, stealing gauge tooth), but the boy remains a silent symbol rather than a character with agency; his passivity weakens the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the dissolving petal charges the final image with conceptual cost (memory as courage), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic cadence shifts in the stairwell descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor's moonlight functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (cupping light to move downstairs) and charges the ending; the rose petal's physical dissolution makes the theme visceral, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Mara opens the bolted door, but the boy's confinement lacks escalation beyond initial setup; cost is felt through petal dissolution yet remains slightly abstract without tangible consequence for him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: "small reflected moon" reweights the harbor's light as enduring hope without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding courage in the petal's physical glow against the bulb.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sloshed like a heartbeat," "tide nosed the pilings") sustains under pressure; no head-hopping, but the boy's POV absence limits dialogue subtext despite naturalistic whisper exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops, but "papery petal lay like a tiny eviction notice" edges toward cliché; rhythmic control excels ("pull, lift, glide") yet one strained metaphor slightly dulls the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "rescuer" trope through specific, lived detail (tomatoes in paint buckets, gauge tooth mechanics); the harbor's reflective light as active metaphor feels inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
