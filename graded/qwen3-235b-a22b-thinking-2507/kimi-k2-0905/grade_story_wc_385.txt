<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation ("ensure life won't become hollow vibration") but interiority leans abstract; "blood-memory recognition" lacks embodied contradiction. Final choice earned by cocoon dissolution, yet micro-choices passive during descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: cocoon dissolution reconfigures echo rules with visible cost ("no rebound of her voice"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to "breathing gallery," satisfying cost proof via canyon's absorption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: basalt releases footsteps, serpentine nexus enables moth-silk gallery climax. Whispering seashell (micro-setting) charges final image as "portable ending," meeting 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when echo questions Lira, narrowing options to descent. But escalation relies on revelation (mother's words) over agency; cost is felt yet not fully earned through her choices, missing high-band escalation guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unfinished departures" motif: cocoon dissolution reweights echoes as "portable endings" without moralizing. Final image of "rooms of air" offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo despite literal echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "taste iron in blood memory," syntax mirroring canyon echoes. "Reed-blown melancholy" modulates perfectly to "forward-leaning" melody. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid at cocoon dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop in "progressive disclosure" (first/then/finally) costs 0.3. Otherwise exceptional density: "luminous threads feeding on residue of yearning" advances plot/theme. No artifacts dull closure's "motes of quiet light" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms echo trope through geological specificity (moth-silk weavers, basalt footsteps). Risk-taking heightens stakes: "universe hums secret song" avoids cliché by serving emotional truth. Fresh synthesis in "endings are portable" reconfiguration.</comment>
