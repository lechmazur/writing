<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("impertience rattling its cage" vs "sculpt patience") drives micro-choices under pressure; transformation to "smooth, dark stone" earns cost through prior causality. Slight abstraction in "unyoke the coast" slightly dilutes tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (revolution's quiet birth); accumulative lens holds via pattern escalation ("moon path skewed," spiral tightening). Minor density in "three midnights ago" backstory stays within BRR limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and magnetic viaduct constrain choices (mapping moon reflections on ice) and charge the final image (compass surrendering). "Graphite dust" and "thawwater" exemplify purpose-driven specificity; proper-noun economy slightly loose but not distracting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elian's agency (tracking moon paths to pinpoint revolution's start), with felt cost in transformed impatience and irreversible coastal change. Human-scale revolution avoids telescopic stakes but could heighten visceral consequences of "unyoking."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "sculpt patience from impatience" evolves from litany to embodied transformation. Final image ("changed not by storm but by quiet map") reweights revolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon’s single silver eye," "lake cracked its knuckles") modulates rhythm under pressure. "Twin heart of impatience" slightly muddles metaphor but compensated by consistent horizon-mapper lexicon and stress-appropriate compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "blue sparks that drifted down like reverse snowfall" exemplifies coherent, purposeful density. Final line ("walked back toward a coast that would already be waking different") achieves resonant propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Revolution reframed as precise magnetic timing transforms familiar premise through horizon mapper’s specificity. "43-second pulse" and graphite tracings create verifiable freshness; avoids derivative templates via emotional truth in patience/impertience duality.</comment>
