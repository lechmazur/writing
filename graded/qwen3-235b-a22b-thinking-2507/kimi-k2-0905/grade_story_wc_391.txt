<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "sculpt patience" line triggers diagnostic label penalty; cooled impatience lacks embodied cost despite strong contradictory impulses in mapping sequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with compass surrender, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but final stone image lacks concrete sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain choices (mapping on ice, sanctuary roof signal); magnetic viaduct's blue sparks charge the final image with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via moon-path skew and 43-second pulse, but Elian's passivity undermines agency; revolution begins off-page via lanterns, reducing on-page cost to conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "restrained wildness" sparks and cooled impatience stone; avoids moralizing but final image's "smooth dark stone" slightly over-explains the earned transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon paths as ricochets") with rhythmic control; "ghostly tracings" and "lung full of frost" exemplify pressure-appropriate compression without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops but "feeling impatience finally cool" triggers label-speak artifact in closure beat; otherwise immaculate propulsion and density with "thawwater after rain" as sole weak modifier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution-as-mapping with "restrained wildness" sparks; avoids derivative tropes but "unyoke" concept remains abstract rather than grounded in tangible stakes.</comment>
