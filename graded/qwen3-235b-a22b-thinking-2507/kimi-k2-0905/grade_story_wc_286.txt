<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clay remembers vs. place refuses to forget) drives micro-choices, but "zen-minded" occasionally flattens embodied struggle; final hive-shaping choice earns endurance with felt cost in "fragile, radiant wall" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "memory of kindness phototropically follow" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though temporal compression slightly obscures escalation logic in vision sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lantern glass functions as micro-setting charging closure (projecting "overlapping suns"); sensory details like "honey turned to ash" and "powdered wax" constrain choices by embodying thematic stakes throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Lin understands "places resist change when no one remembers how to tend kindness"; conceptual cost is unmistakable in covenant ("memory travels forward only when carried by kindness") driving agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("fragile, radiant wall between past and future") reweights kindness as active resistance without moralizing; theme emerges solely through concrete actions like the unfired hive accepting wetness as "promise".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("clay remembers," "phototropic to kindness") creates rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping despite timeline fractures, with syntax modulating from "fractured timelines flickered like torn silk" to "sharp gentleness".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("wax ghosts still clinging to slats" slightly overwrites); no loops or scaffold, though "veiled beekeepers spinning golden wheels of time" risks mixed metaphor without compromising closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms abandonment trope through specific logic (unfired hive as "kiln of collective mercy"); risk-taking (fractured timelines as tangible pressure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making emotional truth inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
