<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lin’s embodied choices (shaping hive, aligning glass) manifest zen philosophy through action, not abstraction. Contradictory impulses in timeline visions deepen motivation. Cost of temporary restoration remains conceptual; visceral stakes could elevate closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in 'oasis would vanish again' with conceptual weight. Final image reconfigures hope as active transmission, not permanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern glass and clay hive constrain choices (finding tree, merging timelines) and charge the final projection. Micro-setting specificity ('wax ghosts,' 'cupped palms' leaves) avoids generic lyricism. Dew on hives crystallizes atmospheric stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory as resistance to change—escalates through Lin’s agency (shaping hive, aligning reflections). Cost unmistakable: oasis restoration is temporary, requiring carried kindness. 'Footprints erasing' embodies earned sacrifice without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'clay remembers' motif and apricot fruit’s 'sharp gentleness,' avoiding moralizing. Final image (child’s jar sealing covenant) resonates non-literally: kindness as living memory. No thematic echo; cost reweights 'resist change' premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lin’s perceptual signature ('sun patterns etched into soot') filters all detail. Rhythmic control under pressure ('thrum deepened... splitting one moment') avoids lyric drift. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during timeline visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; 'bee-wing vibration inside her skull' exemplifies high-density figurative language. Final line ('guiding every gentle thing home') recharges lantern motif with propulsion. Minor register drift in 'phototropic to kindness' avoids therapy-speak through embodied context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and memory mechanics. Tropes transformed: potter as temporal healer, timelines as physical silk. 'Unfired hive murmured with wings' risks poetic abstraction but earns coherence through prior clay logic.</comment>
