<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests through embodied action (kneeling to clean skull while doubting gods) not therapy-speak; micro-choices like aligning sundial on vertebrae reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "spaces her exile had hollowed."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "faith return—not as thunder but as breath" reconfigures belief's nature while "filling the spaces her exile had hollowed" makes cost legible; accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to dawn's reassembly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting constraint: roots knitting femurs to fig trunks directly shapes the root-road journey, while sundial base's physicality charges the final image cemented in chapel floor confirming "time, like faith, could be rebuilt."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: mapping sunlight through cracks deepens knowledge, leading to rib-gnomon planting; cost crystallizes in "spaces her exile had hollowed" as faith's return demands enduring responsibility rather than passive restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image "every interrupted journey can resume if given a shadow to follow" offers resonant non-literal answer to diaspora's broken continuity, reweighting the sundial's shadow through concrete ritual rather than abstract moral; avoids thematic echo via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature ("blossoms opened in colors that had no names") and rhythmic control under pressure ("roots had begun to move, knitting femurs to fig trunks") maintain distinct voice; lyric compression taught early with "fossilized petals" pays off in closure's "planet’s slow spin."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cautious enchantment thick as honey around her tongue" demonstrates high-density figurative language serving pressure without muddle; final line’s "shadow to follow" achieves crystalline propulsion through concrete reprise of sundial motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through specific logic: faith rebuilt via sundial shadows not speeches, roots threading bones as "warmly curious" constraint; risk-taking lyrical structure pays off with closure image where time and faith share rebuildable nature without gimmickry.</comment>
