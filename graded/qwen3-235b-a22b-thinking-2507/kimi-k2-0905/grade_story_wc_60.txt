<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s "luminous skeptic" interiority avoids therapy-speak; her micro-choices (speaking to the box, dissolving shards) earn the liberation arc. Slight abstraction in "building walls" dilutes embodied emotion at one pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: geese resuming flight as memories dissolve reconfigures the "defiant hush" from absence to release. Accumulative escalation through four breadcrumbs deepens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dry fountains and the stained glass box constrain every choice; the city’s "memory of water" charges the final image. Sensory specificity favors visual over tactile, slightly narrowing urgency during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (liberating memories) tightens through Mara’s agency at each fountain, with visible cost in dissolving shards. Geese’s suspended/resumed flight crystallizes the stakes’ transformation under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete dissolution of glass shards, not moralizing; final line ("silence of things finally let go") reweights abandonment without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality by focusing on sensory release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sidereal patience," "breadcrumbs of light") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "building walls" momentarily flattens voice during a key vulnerability beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with rhythmic propulsion ("geese shifted slightly, their wings twitching"). One abstract phrase ("building walls so high") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandonment tropes via "fountains of lies/goodbyes"; emotional specificity in "liberation not grief" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (paused time) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
