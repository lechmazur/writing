<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through concrete actions ("building walls so high") and embodied emotion (shards dissolving with speech). Final choice to speak as "a daughter" earns liberation motive, though "liberation not grief" risks slight abstraction without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: geese resuming flight reconfigures the "defiant hush" with conceptual cost (hollow box left behind). Accumulative lens holds through four fountain beats, each tightening emotional weight with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dry fountains constrain choices (Mara must follow breadcrumbs on barren ground), while the box's physicality charges the final image. Sensory details ("kisses that tasted of salt and iron") avoid cliché by filtering through character urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from unblocking memories to confronting abandonment, narrowing options to speech as the only viable action. Cost crystallizes in the hollow box left behind, though the geese's suspension slightly over-abstracts the temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete dissolution of shards ("let them dissolve like perfume"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "defiant hush" from absence to release, offering non-literal resolution to abandonment without tidy redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience") shapes diction. Rhythmic control intensifies during memory releases, though "liquid light" risks slight abstraction in peak beat. No head-hopping; single-POV remains cohesive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "paused sky" to "geese resumed flight" shows masterful cadence shift. Minor overwriting in "pooling around her feet" edges toward lyric excess but avoids muddling closure. Propulsion never stalls despite reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>Transforms abandonment trope through "sidereal patience" as active constraint (memories waiting with star-time weight). Fresh inflection in "forgiveness" as release rather than reconciliation, avoiding safety-hedging through the hollow box's irreversible cost.</question>
