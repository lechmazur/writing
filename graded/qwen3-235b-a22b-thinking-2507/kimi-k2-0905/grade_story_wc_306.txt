<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sincerely insincere" faces and trembling hands, but geologist's shift lacks embodied cost—his transformation occurs off-page during the mirror shard moment, weakening the earned renunciation required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "raw music of not knowing" crystallizes the shift from encoded doubt to vulnerable truth with conceptual cost (destroyed coral now viscerally real), all under a tight Accumulative/Textural lens where wind chime patterns accumulate pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard constrains choices (Mira's diagnostic tool) and charges the final image (filled with grief), while the lighthouse's "honest wind" directly pressures the geologist's stance shift—micro-setting as environment passes the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mira's agency: her offer to "let the wind have" certainty narrows options to truth or self-deception, with felt cost in the geologist's fractured reflection of dying coral—escalation is driven by her choice, though the physical cost remains implied rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wind chimes' evolution from encoded doubt to "raw music," avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "protected vulnerability" as the only honest foundation for decisions without stating a thesis, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"moral radiation," "wind of nuance"—but the geologist's dialogue lacks distinct voice, converging with Mira's lyricism during the climax, slightly blurring status dynamics required for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "moral radiation" risks therapy-speak in a high-pressure beat; density remains controlled until "sentenced to death" slightly overwrites the coral metaphor, creating minor figurative muddle that costs 0.4 from potential 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "conscience for hire" trope through the hollow mirror's physics-defying void and wind chime cipher, making moral processing tangible; the lighthouse setting avoids cliché by weaponizing its "honest wind" against corporate denial, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
