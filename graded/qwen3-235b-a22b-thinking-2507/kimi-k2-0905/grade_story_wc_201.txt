<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("wrote the coefficient of his grin on the inside of my cheek") and motivation intensifies organically, but clinical terms like "proprioceptively enhanced" risk diagnostic label-speak in peak trauma beats without sufficient embodied cost within 2–3 lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("no lighter, but with numbers scribbled along my arms"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; the forest’s dimming reweights mercy’s asymptotic nature with conceptual cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (reading sap bruises) and charges closure; the pewter strap’s transformation from "wedding ring made of scars" to "piece of trash" reweights the dominant stake through irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (three equations deepening the mercy/suffering calculus) is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens; the cost of removing the strap—"wet and warm, a slug of metal"—is unmistakable and alters the final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the asymptote motif evolves from "close enough counted" to the cooling strap’s "honest miracle," avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant answer to mercy’s nature in the final line’s equation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ultraviolet sap print its bruise-colored fingerprints") is character-particular, and rhythmic control under pressure (staccato during trauma spasms) avoids head-hopping; diction stays within traumatized intellect’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere/character ("laughter was the only decimal place left" compresses trauma into math). Figurative language ("cathedral of invisible fire") remains coherent under high-pressure beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical rigor and penitential trauma feels inevitable ("mercy is asymptotic, forever approaching zero suffering"); the risk of conceptual closure pays off through the strap’s final transformation without gimmickry.</comment>
