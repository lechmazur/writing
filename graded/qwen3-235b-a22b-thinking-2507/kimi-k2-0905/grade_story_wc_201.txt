<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mathematics of mercy" pursuit versus embodied trauma; micro-choices like writing coefficients on cheek reveal values under pressure. No second character present to test status dynamics, but single-POV baseline fully met with embodied emotion ("tasted copper," "hiccup of light").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "stepped back to see if the forest would accept the approximation" crystallizes asymptotic mercy with visceral cost ("walked out no lighter"). Accumulative/Textural lens held through ultraviolet dimming and cooling strap, reweighting stakes via sensory cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "leaves folding into ordinary darkness" mirrors emotional shift while the strap's glow fading into "trash" embodies the asymptote concept. Body (proprioception) constrains every choice, from bracing against trees to reading "forest’s ledger" through sap bruises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite vivid pain ("mathematics of mercy" as dominant stake). Pressure tightens via proprioceptive spikes escalating to "map spelled out a single digit: 1," but lacks tangible trade-offs—no visible cost beyond endurance. Agency in tearing off strap earns Earned Stasis, yet escalation feels internal rather than materially narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "ultraviolet sap print its bruise-colored fingerprints" filters setting through penitent’s trauma. Rhythmic control peaks in "counting steps like rosary beads, every footfall a datum," with elision ("survival was just the anesthesia wearing off") taught early and paid off in fragmented memories. Zero head-hopping in single-POV intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose density dazzles ("proprioceptively enhanced; every twig’s snap echoed inside my joints like a second skeleton"), but minor scaffold appears: "Remembering through trauma responses was the only method left" slightly over-explains. No closure-impacting loops; "polygraph needle" simile risks cliché yet earns weight via "skipping right before the subject breaks" specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical rigor and bodily penance ("mercy equals pain over memory plus one") transforms dystopian tropes. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off through closure’s "honest miracle" of the cooling strap—avoids abstraction by rooting universals in "slug of metal" specificity. Avoids safety middle via unflinching trauma calculus.</comment>
