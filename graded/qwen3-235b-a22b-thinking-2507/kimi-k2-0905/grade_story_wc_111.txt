<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority manifests through embodied actions like polishing marbles with spider-silk cloth; contradictory impulses (servant/master deception) culminate in earned endurance with visceral cost when marbles warm against her palm during the apple revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the glove's discovery crystallizes the garden's reciprocal knowing with conceptual cost (her lifelong deception reframed as partnership), under Accumulative/Textural lens where every marble-polishing beat tightens the human-vegetative negotiation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marbles function as micro-setting that charges the final image—warmer in the glove's palm—and constrain choice throughout, from commemorating victories to creating constellations under the apple tree, avoiding ornamental symbolism through tactile integration with pruning and dreaming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the garden's impossible apple for 0.03% luck day, narrowing options to a single resonant choice: biting into the fruit as a renunciation of measurable love, with visceral cost in the marbles' warmth reconfiguring her self-deception into partnership.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the apple's taste ("every season compressed into perfect sweetness"), offering a non-literal answer to "who tends whom" without moralizing; the glove/marbles final image reweights the opening deception with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in selective details ("hedges shifting to create new pathways"), with rhythmic control during high-pressure moments like the apple bite; no head-hopping despite single POV, and lyric compression taught early pays off in the glove's revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "commemorating small victories elaborately" appears verbatim twice but earns repetition through motif evolution, while "cracked surfaces" metaphors maintain physical logic and propel closure without muddying the glove's charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "measurable luck" trope through the garden's sentient defiance; the glove reveal synthesizes vine-dresser identity with marbles' history, avoiding derivative safety with bold specificity in "leather soft as if waiting for her" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
