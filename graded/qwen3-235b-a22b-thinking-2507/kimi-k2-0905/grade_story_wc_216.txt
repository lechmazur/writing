<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (measuring vs. feeling time) drives micro-choices like pocketing tags; embodied cost in "texture shift inside ribs" makes endurance earned. Final renunciation of numerical time crystallizes through tactile exchanges, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "texture shift" reconfigures time as exchange with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds—dust motes to price tags to shivers build pressure without causal gaps. Orientation anchors by line 10 ("emerald silo at dawn").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (ladder climbs, cairn-building) and charges the final image. Urn fragment’s "crazed glaze" evolves from sensory detail to traded currency, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: reading tags shifts from curiosity to trading sensations ("genuine shiver"). Cost is unmistakable in "granular metallic dust" on the tongue and "texture shift inside ribs," reweighting the dominant stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects (price tags as memory currency), not moralizing. Final image—"exchange sensations, each narrative heartbeat a coin"—resonantly answers "texture of time" without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasted faintly of iron, like blood from a bitten minute") reflects timekeeper’s profession. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—lyric cadence in silo ascent, clipped urgency at garage sale—no head-hopping in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fine metallic dust that settled on the tongue" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (sensory, thematic, closure). Final line’s Braille metaphor recharges prior motifs without muddle, sustaining propulsion to last word.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-measurement trope via sensory exchange economy: price tags as "miniature diaries" feel inevitable. Risk-taking (objects as narrative engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("Coffee mug that remembers every 6 a.m.") avoids abstraction.</comment>
