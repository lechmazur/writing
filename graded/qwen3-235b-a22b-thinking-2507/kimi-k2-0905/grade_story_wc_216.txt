<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete micro-choices (rubbing urn fragment, reading tags) avoids epiphanies; contradictory impulses (seeking/accepting unmeasured time) manifest through sensory exchanges. Final renunciation of measurement logic earns cost via the traded shiver's texture shift in ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when timekeeper grasps time as exchanged sensations, charged by the traded urn fragment's "genuine shiver" cost. Accumulative lens holds through tag discoveries and snow globe transaction; persistent constraint (unnumbered time) shapes the final cairn-building.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that charges closure: the cairn of tags anchored by urn shard on the rim makes environment constrain choice (how to honor unmeasured time). Dust motes' "unnumbered waltz" evolves into granular light texture, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscovering time's texture) tightens through the price-tag discoveries and culminates in the shiver trade's cost. Agency-driven escalation: timekeeper's decision to descend and engage shifts from observation to embodied exchange, narrowing options to sensory commerce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "granular metallic dust" reweights time's nature without moralizing. Final image of dispersing garage sale offers resonant answer—time as circulating sensations—via traded snow globe and texture shifts, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light tasted faintly of iron, like blood from a bitten minute") filters all observation. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure (tag discoveries' staccato pacing), with elision ("yesterday/9/3") taught early and paid off in sensory prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density where every line charges atmosphere ("crazed glaze looked like cracked hourglass glass"). Figurative language serves pressure ("granular metallic dust that settled on the tongue") without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms timekeeping tropes through specific sensory commerce (price-tag messages as currency). Risk-taking (abandoning numerical logic for embodied exchange) heightens stakes coherently, with the snow globe trade feeling inevitable via prior tag discoveries.</comment>
