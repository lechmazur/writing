<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "virtuously mischievous" grin versus debt trauma; embodied emotion via brass bolt pressure and palm blood. Final renunciation of unpaid labor earns cost through concrete "borrowed gravity" insight. Only slight abstraction in "forgiveness was currency" risks diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: diamond creation dissolves debt cycles with visible cost (bloodied palm, "paid in full" spores). Accumulative escalation intensifies through spore-solidified texts and pressure doubling. "Sewn shut" seam phrasing slightly over-explains the earned silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: irrigation hum frequency enables parallel contact; quartz tiles record footsteps as "barometric scars." Final image charged by spores spelling "paid in full" on jeans. "Neon scripture" metaphor risks overwriting but stays character-particular for cult survivor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt as physical pressure) tightens through protagonist agency: twisting bolt crystallizes "carbonizing" installments. Cost is unmistakable in diamond drawing blood and dissolving sales pitches. Parallel-Liras chorus deepens pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: "promise = matter, regret = energy" becomes literal transmutation. Final constellations as "cancelled invoices" offers resonant non-literal answer. Near-miss with "unpaid labor = borrowed gravity" skirting thematic echo but saved by character-specific insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "pixels sliding sideways like squeezing through a seam" – spores as "quantum promise," not tourist observation. Rhythm modulates perfectly: staccato during crystallization ("crack rang out"), fluid in lullaby resolution. Zero head-hopping despite parallel selves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "barometric scars" and "neon scripture" earn density through character logic. Propulsion flawless: "Lira crawled... bolt clinking" advances plot while charging atmosphere. Minor risk in "quantum promise" abstraction offset by immediate causal payoff in spore-solidified texts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme tropes transformed through bioluminescent physics: debt literally carbonizes into diamonds. Bolt-to-diamond alchemy feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Highest risk (parallel selves) grounded in farm's established "quantum promise" rules, heightening stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
