<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids label-speak: "cold brass echo the pressure inside her chest" embodies trauma. Contradictory impulses shine in the "virtuously mischievous" grin amid haunting texts. Final refusal of unpaid labor earns change through concrete cost (bleeding palm, "borrowed gravity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): pitching diamond calms ocean while "void" constellations reprice debt. Cost is visceral (blood-drawn palm) and conceptual ("debt cycle broken"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mushroom farm actively constrains choices: crawling the drip line, spores spelling "paid in full," dimming to fuel the reaction. Final image ("ordinary nightlights for tomatoes") recharges the setting’s purpose with earned humility after cosmic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (debt transmutation) tightens via Lira’s agency: her "trade pressure for diamonds" text forces the drip-line meeting. Cost is unmistakable—"edges draw blood from her palm" as debt carbonizes, then refracted halos mark the shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "promises photosynthesize into debt" becomes literal transmutation. Final image ("void" constellations, calmed ocean) offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, reweighting invoices as cancelled through lived cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice filters all perception through Lira’s trauma: "copper spores," "barometric scars," "quantum promise like neon scripture." Syntax modulates under pressure—fragmented during bolt twist ("Pressure spiked; the mushrooms dimmed")—with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding: "pixels sliding sideways like they were squeezing through a seam" does triple duty (image, metaphor, stakes). Final line ("settled into ordinary nightlights for tomatoes") recharges the farm’s purpose without sentimentality. One near-redundant phrase ("unbearable clarity") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms pyramid schemes into quantum debt physics: the bolt’s brass coldness echoes chest pressure, and shearing it creates the diamond. Risk-taking (parallel selves as debt collectors) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "void" constellations feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
