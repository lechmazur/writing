<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied actions (bolt-turning, heartbeat-counting) and micro-choices under pressure. Motivation ("cost of safety paid in voices") intensifies credibly during the boy’s surgery. Minor deduction for slightly underdeveloped contradiction in his stance toward silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the boy grips the bolt—cost legible in "knuckles whitening like sunrise through ice" and the fortress’s "microscopic fracture." Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; density shift at surgery reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress actively constrains choices: snow erases footprints, discoloration guides movement, and nerve-regeneration timing dictates surgical pressure. Piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("a single note struck"). Environment shapes tactics without ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voices vs. safety) tightens during surgery through the bellhop’s endurance ("remain"). Boy’s whitening knuckles and "unpardonable silence" gaze make cost visceral. Agency lies in silent presence foreclosing speech; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bolt’s evolution—from "seraphically mundane" anchor to potential "single note." Final image reweights "safety" without moralizing; the ledger ("one voice subtracted... one snowflake more") crystallizes conceptual cost. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "whether safety was worth the price."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of metal and old songs"; "frostbitten hope crystallizing on lashes") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical openings to surgical terseness. Minor deduction for one register drift ("seraphically mundane" risks overwriting in high-stakes beat).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion until template cadence in "Each morning..." and "During nerve regeneration..." paragraphs (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Final image’s clarity ("bolt’s iron memory to travel skin to skin") rescues momentum. Zero figurative muddle; "snow kept falling, erasing footprints" exemplifies purposeful density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms silence trope through cobalt fortress’s physicality and nerve-regeneration specificity. Bolt’s mundane weight ("cold iron, threaded with precision") avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off—closure’s "single note" feels inevitable yet fresh. No derivative premise guardrail triggered.</comment>
