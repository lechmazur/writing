<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied urgency ("hurried, mapping faster") and artistic precision; micro-choices like horizon-tracing onto ceiling crystallize hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels. Final endurance earns closure through prior causality ("crumbling into sand" foreclosing physical action).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "Exhaustion hit; she lay on the glass floor" crystallizing temporal displacement. Accumulative lens holds via memory-density escalation ("fifteen minutes left" tightening options), with persistent constraint (time) shaping final image of inherited symphony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass spire functions as active micro-setting—printing ghostly selves, conducting dawnlight—constraining choices (kneeling at apex) and charging closure: "spire dimmed" yet symphony persists. Environment’s conductive properties directly enable the final image’s legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via relentless countdown ("thirty minutes... fifteen minutes") driving protagonist’s agency, but exhaustion’s conceptual cost ("chronologically homesick ache dissolved") feels slightly abstract versus visceral collapse. One meaningful deepening (prophetic loops) forecloses escape with felt physical price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "map she had drawn was the home she missed" reweights premise without moralizing. Final horizon-as-eyelid-line offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo while layering "you are already home" chord with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lungs tasted iron," "sub-audible B-flat") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical memory-etching to staccato exhaustion. Patterned elision taught early ("palimpsest of birthdays") pays off in closure’s "batonless" legacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—each line multiplies meaning ("grain a note falling... embedding as bubbles"). Figurative language serves pressure: "clef like breaking wave" ties to lake’s mirrored score. Final line’s "batonless" crystallizes legacy with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms fortune cookies into temporal cartography via specific details (Devonian tides, factory basement smells). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "upturned hush" feels inevitable yet unprecedented in closure’s inherited symphony.</comment>
