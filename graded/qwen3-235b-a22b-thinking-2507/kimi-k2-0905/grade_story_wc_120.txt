<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("chronologically homesick") lacks embodied specificity; emotional progression leans on abstract labels like "prophetic loops" without sufficient physical manifestation during exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: horizon etched on eyelids reconfigures "home" with conceptual cost (dissolved ache), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through memory-etching sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake as "score written backward" constrains etching tactics and charges final image; minor deduction for occasional sensory overload ("sub-audible B-flat") diluting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Timeframe ("thirty minutes") tightens decisions meaningfully, but exhaustion's cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; dominant stake (mapping vs. dissolution) lacks physical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "you are already home" chord reweights memory-as-home without moralizing; final image (child hearing dawn) resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lungs tasted iron," "upturned hush") modulates under stress; no head-hopping, though lyric compression risks over-ornamentation in memory sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "Devonian tides" and "tie-rod loosening" register-dip slightly in high-pressure beats; final image retains crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie writing as symphonic score transforms clichés through specific physics (mirrored horizon as staff lines); risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
