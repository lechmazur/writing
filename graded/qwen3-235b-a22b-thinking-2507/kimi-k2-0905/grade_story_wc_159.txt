<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Por's unfinished name and systematic surrender of memories, but emotional progression leans slightly tidy during memory sacrifices without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with Lira's self-erasure ("foxglove regret sweet on her tongue"), visible cost undeniable as she hollows into a silhouette for the chandelier's demand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass-orchid petals constrain choice by catching sound-wisps and charge the final image as Lira becomes a "translucent silhouette," though opal library descriptions occasionally verge on static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency—amplifying the lullaby, selecting memories—with unmistakable cost as each sacrifice hollows her, narrowing options to the final self-offering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lullaby's mechanics and memory-for-name trade; final image ("foxglove regret that keeps the sky from forgetting") resonates without moralizing, reweighting preservation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("echoing like a dropped pearl"), rhythmic control sustains under pressure, though "diaphragms of sky" slightly strains the mythic lexicon in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless density but "gently systematic" repetition (3x) creates minor scaffold; no loops in closure beat, though "cracked bamboo tube" descriptions edge toward ornamental in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms extinction grief through concrete mechanics (memory-for-name exchange); "glass-orchid caretaker" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, risk-taking heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
