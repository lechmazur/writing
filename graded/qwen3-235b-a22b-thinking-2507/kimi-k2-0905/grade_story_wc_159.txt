<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (love for Por vs duty) drive choices, but Por’s backstory lacks sufficient on-page friction; the final sacrifice feels earned though emotionally thin at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Lira’s self-erasure forecloses her path with visceral cost ("hollow into translucent silhouette"), and the Accumulative lens holds as bulb-by-bulb sacrifices reweight the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass-orchid petals (tool) constrain choice by capturing sound-wisps, and the fossilized sigh lectern charges the final image; "diaphragms of sky" uniquely shapes twilight urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency: repairing the tube with Wrath/Serenity tools narrows options, but the chandelier’s "payment" demand feels externally imposed rather than arising from prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bamboo tube’s evolution: its final note teaching "the sound of the glass-orchid caretaker" reweights preservation as cyclical, avoiding moralizing while charging the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature ("syllables like silk scarves pulled through needle eyes") stays consistent under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in the child’s final breath on the tube.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding in "her duty, gently systematic" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, zero loops and high density ("plume of audible light drifted upward like phosphorescent plankton") propel closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through visceral specificity: "cities of uncried tears" gains emotional truth via the apology-gardens blooming crimson, with the foxglove heart shape making regret tangible without abstraction.</comment>
