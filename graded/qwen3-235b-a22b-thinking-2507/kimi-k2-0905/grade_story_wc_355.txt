<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mirelle's pacifism manifests in concrete choices (waiting vs. forcing lock) with embodied contradiction ("velvet patches over bullet holes she had never earned"). Final renunciation—carrying silences in her bloodstream—earns cost through prior causality of tuning/singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: diary opens via resonance (not force), with undeniable cost in "walking archive of silences." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—frequency tuning escalates density until the final silence reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal radio (guitar strings from bombed weddings) constrains choices and charges closure: Mirelle lifts it to the sky, diode "glowing like a star that had learned to listen." Micro-setting pressure evident as workshop's shadows "lean inward" during tuning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mirelle's agency: naming silences ("Absence, Hesitation, Shame") deepens knowledge until final frequency forces the cost of becoming "its echo." Fireworks' approach tightens time pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Silence That Apologizes for Existing" reframes empathy as resonance. Final mirror/poppie image offers non-literal answer—silence becomes song carried in bloodstream—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "hush inside the hush" and frequencies as textures. Rhythmic control under pressure ("She quickened her tuning, spiraling upward") avoids head-hopping; single-POV consistency flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals of nothing" and "silence could be a weapon" achieve high density without muddle. Final line ("Your silence is safe with me") recharges poppy/mirror motif with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms pacifism trope through specific mechanics (frequencies as empathy). Risk-taking (silence as tangible frequency) heightens stakes coherently; "theatrical sincerity" converting pain to performance feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
