<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via velvet patches over bullet holes and "theatrical sincerity" masking trauma; tears without percussion embody grief, but sister's absence slightly weakens relationship crucible despite radio-mediated voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: unlocked clasp becomes "tuning fork shaped like a question" with conceptual cost in "silence that lets the world speak without killing," reconfiguring empathy under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting constrains every choice—sawdust, radio, and brass clasp charge the final image; "sawdust and gunpowder waiting for celebration" exemplifies sensory urgency shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through frequency discoveries narrowing options, but escalation leans more on sensory accumulation than agency-driven pressure; forgiveness frequency's "draft moving through the ribs" deepens cost effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Final image ("citizenship requires no oath but this") reweights empathy as active listening without moralizing; "brassy night" frequency avoids abstraction, making theme resonate through the child's paused cry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "boots creaking like polite applause" and "silence like perfume"; rhythmic control sustains lyric compression ("singing cannons") without head-hopping or voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "tears arrived without percussion" shows high-density craft, though "chrysanthemum of sound" edges toward slight overwriting in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology and pacifism feels inevitable; "velvet patches over bullet holes" transforms trope through specific, verifiable detail that avoids generic pacifist clichés.</comment>
