<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("intimately aloof") manifests in micro-choices: leaving unlocked door, rejecting station for unknown path. Final renunciation (abandoning shell) earns cost through prior tactile intimacy with the object, though secondary pressure is absent in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "wedged the painted shell into a fissure" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (preservation vs. loss). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; "temporary eternity" reweights the stake with undeniable pressure in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cave network functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (guided by dripping water) and charges the final image. "Crushed shells that chimed" evolves into bioluminescent plankton dictating painting rhythm, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ren’s agency: turning inland, entering cleft, copying the shell. Cost is legible in "fatigue blurred form" and the irreversible act of leaving the canvas-shell. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks visible trade-off beyond time/energy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shell’s "temporary eternity" reweights memory against demolition. Final image ("painted quay kept its perfect hour forever") offers non-literal answer to loss without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "temporary eternity" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in painterly details ("spiderweb of silver," "porcelain bells"). Voice modulates under pressure ("tasted salt though no blood had reached his lips") with rhythmic control; no head-hopping in single-POV. Elision (time passage) taught early via "what felt like hours."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bioluminescent plankton that freckled the cave ceiling" compresses setting/action without muddle. Minor overwriting in "circular saws eating the sky" (-0.1) but density serves Accumulative escalation. Final line’s "wave by wave" cadence charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms nostalgia trope through painter’s specific lens: mirror’s fracture as creative death, shell as organic canvas. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "temporary eternity" feels inevitable through prior particulars like the salt-sweat walls.</comment>
