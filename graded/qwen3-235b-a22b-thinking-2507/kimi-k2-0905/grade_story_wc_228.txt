<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "intimately aloof" evolution and salt-taste memory, but Ren’s motivation lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments—his promise-driven turn feels inevitable rather than contested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "giving the future a place to remember" wedges irreversible cost into the fissure, with the plankton flare crystallizing stakes. Orientation is anchored by line 3, and Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crushed shells chiming under boots and salt-sweat-glazed walls constrain movement and perception, but the cave’s mineral breath doesn’t actively pressure Ren’s final choice—micro-setting elevates description yet falls shy of tactical constraint for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ren’s agency: copying the shell’s self-updating vision forces abandonment of his canvas, with cost legible in "transference" and bus ticket paid by the mirror’s sale. Pressure accumulates relentlessly under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shell’s "temporary eternity"—the final plankton flare reweights memory without moralizing, offering resonant answer: art survives only where hidden, charged by Ren’s tasted salt as living sea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is painterly ("gulls screamed like circular saws"), with syntax tightening under stress ("packed his oils, left... keys were for people who planned to return"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from aloof to reverent seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "tasted salt though no blood had reached his lips" slightly abstracts sensation in peak stress—minor cadence stumble where embodied immediacy would heighten pressure, costing 0.1 from perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "artist’s crisis" trope through the shell’s self-updating painting—fresh inflection where the quay paints itself, making "temporary eternity" feel inevitable yet revelatory. Risk-taking (cave as memory vault) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
