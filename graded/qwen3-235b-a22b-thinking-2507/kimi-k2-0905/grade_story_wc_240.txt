<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's grief-driven motivation and spatial contradiction (seeking Luc while understanding "no original") feel authentic, but the "understood: the farm didn't duplicate people" insight risks over-articulation under peak pressure, slightly flattening internal conflict at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (relinquished grief crystallized in the white flare), and the Accumulative lens holds through spore patterns and laser dots. Minor deduction: the "quantum signatures" explanation slightly softens the conceptual cost's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (laser dot reappearances) and charges the final image (white flare erasing regret). The spores swarming Luc's outline mirror internal states without overt symbolism, achieving 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Maya realizes "no original, no copy," forcing the merge choice. Escalation is driven by her agency (laser-dot pathing), but Dr. Voss's exposition slightly dilutes the pressure build; cost is legible in "relinquished grief" yet lacks a concrete tactical price paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The final image ("echo arriving as light dispersing through relinquished grief") delivers a resonant Conceptual Repricing of grief as spatial permeability, reweighting the farm's physics without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from spores copying Luc's shape and the laser's breadcrumb function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV maintains distinct perceptual signature ("nested topographies," "ionized air") with rhythmic compression under stress ("She clicked rapidly"). Slight deduction: "understood: the farm didn't duplicate people" momentarily shifts into explanatory mode, disrupting interiority's texture during a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quiet wildfire" motif reprises with escalating charge. Prose achieves crystalline propulsion ("red dots chaining a path only the spatially gifted could read"). Final line ("echo finally arriving... as light dispersing") exemplifies textural specificity charging closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via spatial physics ("permeable barriers of regret"), with emotional truth rooted in Maya's spatial memory tingling "along her skin." The fungal farm's compassionate forgery avoids safety-hedging, committing fully to its non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
