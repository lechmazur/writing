<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through "life measured in sure strokes of rabbit-skin glue" and contradictory impulses (certainty vs curiosity) culminating in earned renunciation. Minor flaw: child/guide lack full pressure despite spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "I will never be certain" crystallizes stakes with felt cost in drained color becoming "possibility." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through folding garden, though second awakening slightly tells rather than shows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active micro-setting: chiming footsteps constrain movement, basalt alleys enable sound reflection that directly charges climax. Obsidian gong and rose-quartz xylophone aren't decorative but pressure Liora's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity vs certainty) tightens when nickel "wanted to barter," narrowing Liora's options to a trade with visible cost in the drained murals. Escalation driven by agency through three awakenings, though city-dreaming insight risks slight tell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "coloring-book ghosts" to "open edges," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights curiosity as "paint flake of pure inquiry" without stating morals, though child's question borders on expositional setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: restoration metaphors ("flecks of color settled like fireflies") filter all observations. Rhythmic control peaks in "silver ribbon that wrapped Liora’s wrists," though child's dialogue lacks subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drained, but not into ruin—into possibility" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Metaphors stay coherent ("coloring-book ghosts"), though "methodically playful" repetition slightly dilutes climax impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic restoration and quantum recursion through specific details (hobo nickel's bindle, rabbit-skin glue). Risk-taking (nested realities) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar curiosity tropes.</comment>
