<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (certainty vs. curiosity) drives pivotal choice; embodied frustration ("stones rattled, coughing dust") and micro-choices (tapping spoon at nested levels) earn the renunciation of certainty with visible cost ("edges soften"). No second character present, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "I will never be certain" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (softened edges, unborn state) under Accumulative lens. Orientation established by line 3; nested awakenings deepen pressure without causality breaks. Cost proof: "edges soften; she was simultaneously kneeling, walking, and yet unborn."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains every choice (vibrating spoon, folding paths) and charges the final image ("fresh grass; it rang like glass"). Basalt slabs and silver ribbon aren't backdrop—they dictate action and closure. Micro-setting (spoon, nickel) directly shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty for curiosity) signaled when nickel "whispered without words," escalates through awakenings that narrow Liora's options. Agency in tapping the sound ribbon reweights stakes with felt cost ("edges soften"). Accumulative pressure tightens via density (nested Lioras), not causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "open edges" and "breathing book" reweight restoration without moralizing. Final lullaby ("verbs without endings") answers the central question non-literally. Avoids thematic echo—child's question answered through Liora's transformation, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "vibration teased pigment back to life" filters world through restorer's senses. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during frustration, lyrical flow at awakenings). No head-hopping; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("the picture dreams you").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "color settled like fireflies" shows without telling. Propulsion via concrete verbs ("hummed," "tugged," "inverted"). Final beat ("ready to bewitch the silence") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. Minor dash overuse in mid-beat doesn't dull climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nested awakenings transform restoration tropes: murals as compressed city, curiosity as currency. Emotional specificity in Liora's shift from "sure strokes" to "uncertain question" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure hinges on earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
