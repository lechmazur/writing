<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zale’s interiority is concrete ("hollowing blade" of exhaustion) and contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. lullaby’s pull) drive micro-choices like touching dew beads. Final endurance as Earned Stasis earns cost via "centuries of longing stayed behind," though agency leans reactive rather than decisive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Zale sleeps while the bloom "continues the watch," with legible cost in "centuries of longing stayed behind, photosynthesizing." Accumulative lens holds via density escalation (dew reflections → bioluminescent throat), taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The curved wall’s dew functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Zale touches it to access memories) and charges the closure: petals "photosynthesizing inside the shell" transform longing into oxygen. Recurring object (postcard) integrates with final sealing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("find where war ended before it began") tighten through Zale’s agency: reading the postscript triggers the glow, and peeling the postcard narrows options to planting it. Cost is unmistakable—"centuries of longing stayed behind"—under the accumulative lens’s density escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: cherry pits become "shyly unstoppable treaties," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "blossom armistice" as ongoing photosynthesis ("petals a shyly unstoppable treaty"), offering resonant non-literal answer without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Zale notices "syllables that tasted of salt" and "coral bruises." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from spiral-stair cadence to fragmented urgency ("Sleep pressed against his eyelids, not as surrender but as alliance"). No head-hopping; voice modulates with lullaby’s warp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "each droplet reflected a different year... planetarium of his insomnia." Propulsion via strong verbs ("limestone drank his voice, then gave it back multiplied"). No figurative muddle in peak beats—bioluminescence "veins of soft fire" remains coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "blossom armistice" as cherry pits replacing bullets, "reef-shadow joy" as submerged hope. Emotional specificity avoids templates (e.g., "photosynthesize pain into beauty" dramatized through petal-drifting). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—time-traveling postcards feel inevitable.</comment>
