<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear/resolve) act in sprint scene; final choice earned by azimuth adjustment micro-choice with visible cost (barefoot vulnerability). Slight thematic abstraction in "tyranny of indifference" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: erased lullabies' return reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation solid by word 15; causal lens holds through key-turn climax without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auric lagoon actively constrains choices (starlight reflections as map) and charges final image ("starlight braided into copper"). Sensory specificity (salt-stained tape, damp boardwalk) avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single tightening (broadcast wiring) driven by Mira's agency forecloses escape path; cost legible in officers' hesitation as erased lullabies return. Stakes viscerally felt through physical vulnerability (barefoot sprint).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (azimuth adjustment restoring voices); final image reweights "indifference" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "lock/key" phrase via earned lullabies payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("starlight ripple like secret language"); syntax compresses under drone pressure. No head-hopping; diction stays consistent with teen rebel's lexicon (e.g., "clenched like a fuse").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "exhaled a sigh of dial tone" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line crystallizes motif without overwriting. Minor academic drift in "revised histories" offset by tactile payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reel-to-reel tech transforms rebellion into precise technical act (azimuth adjustment). Avoids safety-middle via specific stakes (erased lullabies) rather than generic "fight the system" tropes.</comment>
