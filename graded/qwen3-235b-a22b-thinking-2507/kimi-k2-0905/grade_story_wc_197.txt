<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Mira’s embodied tension between street-artist futility and revolutionary hope; her micro-choice threading the tape reel—hands trembling but precise—earns the final renunciation with visible cost as drones close in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: officers hesitate hearing erased lullabies, crystallizing the cost of memory’s return; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as starlight-to-copper reconfiguration makes indifference’s tyranny legible through sensory density, not causal beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s starlight actively constrains choices (timing drones via Orion’s reflection) and charges closure—voices rising from water reweighting the "hollow" of erased stories; salt-aged tape’s physicality shapes the final act’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mira’s agency aligning azimuth heads to reclaim voices, narrowing options to a single recorded whisper; cost is unmistakable as drones’ spotlights slice the booth—yet the tyranny’s collapse feels slightly coincidental in the officers’ hesitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through copper-wired voices overwriting "static politeness," not moralizing; the final puddle reflection—showing "voices impossible to silence"—resonantly answers the central question without stating "indifference is a lock."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "starlight ripple across the water like a secret language," filtering tech through poetic urgency; rhythmic control peaks as "Orion in the lagoon, each glint a Morse beat" compresses stress without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "key clenched like a fuse" avoids cliché via precise pressure; only a minor cadence dip in "revised histories—edited conversations..." slightly dulls momentum near the inciting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms surveillance tropes through tactile specificity—magnetic reels overwriting "lived moments with static politeness"—while "coded freedom" feels earned via puddle-waveform mechanics, not abstract idealism.</comment>
