<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines through concrete engineering actions (rerouting valves, soldering beacons) rather than abstract reflection; her contradiction—believing hope is "plumbable" yet needing tactile proof—drives every choice. The child's laugh as "datum zero" crystallizes earned change with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: nutrient lines dripping light reweights "departure gates become arrival gates" with undeniable conceptual cost (exhausted "optimism budget" made tangible). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (starlight, sextant vibrations) tightens toward the beacon's ultraviolet pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sextant constrains choice (guiding Mara to CREW ONLY tunnel) and charges closure (dripping light nourishing "idea" of arrival). Abandoned terminal’s irrigation lines function as micro-setting, evolving from "nervous systems" to hope-conduits with tactile specificity ("brass fragment," "cool light").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation: Mara’s quiet battle against the city’s "sagging" optimism escalates via redirected flows’ physicality (valve-soldering, beacon charging). Cost is conceptual—redefining "hope" as engineering—but the sextant’s transformation lacks one visceral tactical sacrifice mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reconfiguration: "departure gates become arrival gates" via redirected flows, avoiding moralizing. Final image of nutrient lines dripping light offers resonant non-literal answer to "equations for hope," reweighting the maze of intentions without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("functionally creative fingers," "plumbing" metaphor for hope) modulates under pressure; lyrical compression ("starlight poured in clean lines") taught early pays off in beacon’s ultraviolet pulse. Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in engineer’s tactile precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "unbudgeted sound," "stoic wonder of the act" compress emotional truth without fluff. Sentence rhythm varies (crisp clauses for action, flowing phrases for reflection); "brass limbs bent like a bird with a secret" avoids mixed metaphor. Final line’s conceptual charge remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "hope" engineering trope through specific civil-engineering logic (flows, valves, beacons). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes via ultraviolet Morse code, but "equations: if hope equals flow..." borders on thematic echo, limiting 9.0+ eligibility.</comment>
