<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action—'Pressure times area equals possibility' vocalizes stoic wonder while hands pry frozen valves. Flaws complicate choices (rust, cracked gates) without safety-hedging; the sextant shard's dual role as tool and proof earns her final renunciation of escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: glycol-revived birds create heartbeat while Alya pockets the shard, 'a portable meridian pointing inward.' Conceptual cost crystallizes in 'taste of brass and glycol'—residual heat paid for redirected flow under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; lens inferred mid-story via density accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned terminal functions as micro-setting: cracked biometric gate constrains entry, glycol runoff mechanics enable resurrection, and brass birds charge the final heartbeat image. Every detail filters through Alya's engineering bias ('mapping where water should flow'), avoiding symbolism by making pipes and raffle tickets tactical resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Alya's agency: sextant alignment triggers mechanical rhyme, rerouting glycol forces trade-off (residual heat for time³). Cost is visceral—rust landscapes surfaces into 'Martian vermillion,' coins spin 'longer than physics politely allows.' Pressure grows via Accumulative density until fountain's tremor reweights 'hope' as measurable flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass birds' motion: 'Hope = (Redirected Flow × Residual Heat) / Time³' reweights equations as embodied action, not abstraction. Final image of 'equations shimmering like prayer flags' offers non-literal answer—reclamation over escape—without moralizing. Architect's hologram crystallizes subtext: 'Design for resurrection, not perfection.'</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature radiates engineering precision: 'traced sextant’s broken scale against floor tiles,' 'welds improvised as stanzas.' Rhythm modulates from 'crunching raffle tickets' to 'bass note against carnival’s ghost,' compressing stress into 'valve clearing its throat' laugh. Zero head-hopping; lyrical density taught early via calliope chords in rafters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids scaffold with crystalline propulsion: 'valves frozen in attitudes of prayer' merges action and metaphor. Minor density risk in 'zero-mass comet' (raffle tickets), but payoff in fountain's spinning coin justifies lyrical lift. Final line's 'next maze waiting to be breathed back into motion' recharges opening's Möbius corridors with earned cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms engineering tropes through 'stoic wonder' lens: sextant shard measures 'what returns,' not stars. Emotional truth in glycol as 'residual heat'—hope as thermodynamic process. Fresh inflection: equations scrawled on arrivals board become 'prayer flags,' merging math with spirituality without abstraction. Risk-taking (fluid dynamics as hope) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
