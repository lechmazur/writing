<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak (devotion consistent); micro-choices like whispering sister’s name reveal values under pressure, but blind spots lack compounding effect. Final renunciation earned by bartering seven years’ barley, with disappearance as visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (disappearance, tears), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid) slightly muddies causality at midpoint. "Dust that refused to settle" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lapis lazuli tile constrains every choice and charges the final image; "cracked lapis lions" and "glazed bricks murmuring equations" show tactile, lived-in specificity. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects astronomer’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via sunrise deadline forcing covenant choice; agency crystallizes when tile placement triggers constellations. Cost unmistakable in "tears salted his lips" and physical erasure, though "unknown" remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tile’s reconfiguration (math as covenant), but "encrypted devotion" borders on thematic echo. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, though sister’s mention slightly over-explains motivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust floated like pale constellations" reflects astronomer’s gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Each stroke echoed like a drum") with zero head-hopping; elision of conquerors taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "pale constellations" metaphor reused effectively in closure. Minor synonym churn ("dusky harmony" → "dusky harmony of encrypted devotion") prevents 10.0, but propulsion remains relentless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as sacred object transforms trope; "empirical irony" twist feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in frugality (bartered barley) avoids genericity, though Babylonian setting risks familiarity without deeper cultural texture.</comment>
