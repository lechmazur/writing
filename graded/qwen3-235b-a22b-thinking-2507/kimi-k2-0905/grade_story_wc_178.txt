<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied choices: bartering seven years' barley for the tile, tracing the final diagonal to seal the covenant. Contradictory impulses (fear of empirical irony vs. longing for mathematical transcendence) drive the oath-swearing, with the sister's whisper anchoring motivation under pressure. Flaw: sister's introduction lacks prior setup, slightly weakening the emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Naram-bel vanishing while dust "refused to settle" crystallizes the cost of guarding the unknown, with the covenant terms ("teach no king") foreclosing his path. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density escalates to the hollow cube’s starlight, where his notes return as prophecy. No flaws touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lapis tile constrains every choice: it opens the sanctum door, centers the covenant, and reappears as "lapis light ripple" in the final image. Setting pressure is tactile ("cracked lapis lions," "copper of that forbidden door"), with Babylon’s bricks "murmuring equations" charging the closure. Micro-setting elevates to indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the sunrise deadline forces schematics-drawing, which reveals the sanctum door. Cost is visceral—tears salting lips as his marginal notes become prophecy—and shapes the covenant’s terms. "Empirical irony" manifests physically (numbers unbarring the door), avoiding abstract escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "encrypted devotion" becomes the covenant’s lived reality, not stated moral. Final image ("dusky harmony... sealing uncertain futures") reweights the premise without resolution, embracing ambiguity. Avoids all anti-patterns—zero thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is astronomer-specific: dust as "pale constellations," time "tasted of copper and ash." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences at door-opening), with no head-hopping. Flaw: "murmuring equations in cuneiform" slightly overextends POV lexicon but serves the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "feet silent on the cracked lapis lions" does triple duty (sensory, character, tension). Final line’s "dusky harmony of encrypted devotion" crystallizes theme without abstraction. Figurative language stays precise ("dust floated like pale constellations") even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via Babylonian specificity: magic square isn’t mystical but a bartered tool for covenant-making. "Empirical irony" redefines ritual (numbers unbar holy door), avoiding derivative premises. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes coherently—no gimmickry.</comment>
