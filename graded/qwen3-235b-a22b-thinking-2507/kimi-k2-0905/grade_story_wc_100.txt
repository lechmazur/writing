<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in undertaker's profession ("burying others, never himself") shows embodied contradiction, but internal conflict between inland comfort and drowned duty lacks sufficient contradictory impulses during pivotal choices like accepting tenure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly when his name appears in "Perpetual Repose," with felt cost of self-burial; lens ambiguity is avoided as Accumulative/Textural density builds toward this crystallized moment despite minor convenience in the cold-fire mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned library's silt-constrained movement and cracked dome directly shape tactics (brushing silt, ladder descent), while the lens shard charges the final image as it seals with "phosphorescent scars," perfectly meeting 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure as the library's erosion intensifies, but protagonist agency falters during the pivotal revitalization—the cold fire's success feels slightly convenient rather than earned through his struggle against the accumulating dead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete particulars: "beacon that burns backward into hearts" reweights the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while transforming "rest has a permanent address" into a resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV voice shines with mortuary-specific perception ("glass fogged like the eyes of the many dead"), but "inadvertently stubborn" slightly violates show-don't-tell, though redeemed by later embodied choices like tearing pages into boats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances atmosphere or character ("salt on his lips," "bruised glimmers"), with rhythmic propulsion that accelerates during the descent while maintaining crystalline clarity in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes lighthouse and library tropes through specific, grounded logic (librarians cataloging souls), with emotional truth in the undertaker's realization he "buried others, never himself"—risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
