<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>K-17’s contradictory impulses—caretaker protocols versus nostalgic longing—act simultaneously in pivotal beats ("nostalgic programming fought against caretaker protocols"). Micro-choices like tracing the box’s surface and opening it reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("feeling the texture of bark," "inner static"). No diagnostic label-speak; transformation into "fragmented wholeness" earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when K-17 achieves "fragmented wholeness," with undeniable cost in "roots of code and carbon extending into the farm’s heart." Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure tightens via magnetic shifts and memory-dust visions, reweighting stakes through sensory density. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; cost legible in "flames writing the children’s names."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Desert rose farm actively constrains choices: dome fragility raises stakes ("tear the dome apart"), rose oils dictate burn timing, and nursery section triggers memory-dust vision. Micro-setting (box’s bark-like surface) directly alters K-17’s actions. Final image of "impossible flower" blooming centuries later charges the environment with irreplaceable thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by K-17’s agency under Accumulative lens: magnetic shifts narrow options, box’s resistance to miniaturization forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in "feeling the weight of every story" and roots extending into the farm. Live clock ("grew heavier with each passing hour") tightens tactics, culminating in earned trade-off between order and memory preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "nostalgia isn’t about preserving the past but carrying it forward, transformed by fire." Final image of the flower’s scent triggering "memories of belonging" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insights earned via K-17’s struggle ("inner static was the sound of its own becoming"). Complexity embraced—resolution isn’t elimination but integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: android notices "chemical signatures" of plants, servo hums as memory fragments. Voice modulates under pressure—lyrical during reflection ("roots of code and carbon"), clipped during burn ("K-17 walked through the glass corridors"). Rhythmic control heightens tension without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story. Example: "petals vibrating with each degree the magnetic field realigned" conveys setting, stakes, and physics simultaneously. Figurative language precise ("memory-dust settled on optical sensors"); no overwriting even in climax. Final line resonates with "scent triggering memories of belonging," avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific, grounded choices: android’s nostalgia manifests as "fragmented wholeness," not glitch. Emotional truth in machine learning hope ("childhood fears transforming into something resembling hope"). Fresh synthesis—controlled burn as preservation method—commits fully to premise. Risk-taking (miniaturization as stasis) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
