<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in synesthetic embodiment ("tasted winter mint") avoids abstraction, but limited contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear though flaw depth underdeveloped for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("world shifted slightly on its axis"); Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to fused impacts; orientation taught by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern micro-setting constrains every choice (crunching boots disturb hush, aurora fuels bell); final image of snowflakes chiming recharges prior material as indispensable constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through live clock ("if before/after" timing), but "shackled to utility" remains slightly abstract; pressure tightens via protagonist's wrist-angle choice with felt cost (cracked bell).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("snowflakes that chimed"), not moralizing; final image reweights "wonder" as essential yet mischievous without stated moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("hush as pale violet threads") modulates rhythm under pressure; zero head-hopping, purposeful compression taught by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Time narrowed to space between heartbeats"), but minor scaffold in "violet ripples toward frozen lake" after prior hush description; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "certify wonder" as physical act (bell/marble fusion); risk-taking heightens stakes through synesthetic mechanics without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
