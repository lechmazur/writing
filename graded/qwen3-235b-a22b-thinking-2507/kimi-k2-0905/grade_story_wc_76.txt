<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dread vs. bleak exhilaration) drive every choice; the cost of losing his counterclockwise gift is embodied in the cracked hunger stone's final placement. Minor abstraction in "proof he was stepping beyond fate’s design" slightly dilutes the climactic rewind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with undeniable cost (his singular gift lost), the Hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds through the temporal fold. Workshop transition lacks one concrete anchor, risking slight momentum bleed at the reset point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hunger stone functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (conducting radiance, growing heavier) and charging the final image. Over-reliance on visual/tactile details slightly diminishes auditory specificity during the tide-pool hiss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency (failed yoyo tricks, string-slit leap), with cost unmistakable in the spent hunger stone and lost ability. One tightening suffices perfectly for this length; no coincidences resolve the core conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (slitting the string, forging a clock that tells no time), avoiding moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer to fate vs. possibility, though "uncertain, alive, and finally unwound" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("slow exhale of low tide," "latent radiance of thirsts") and rhythmic control under pressure ("He chose neither, leapt... slit the string") showcase mastery. No head-hopping; elision of the temporal fold is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances plot/character (e.g., "yoyo whirled loose, spraying sparks that drew a fiery spiral"). Final line recharges motifs with crystalline clarity. Figurative density never obscures causality even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes through specific mechanics (yoyo escapement, hunger stone physics); emotional truth in "bleak exhilaration" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the lighthouse's origin remains slightly untransformed.</comment>
