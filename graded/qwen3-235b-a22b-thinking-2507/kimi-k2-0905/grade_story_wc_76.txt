<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied dread (hunger stone "feeding on accelerating dread") and micro-choices (winding string backward), but "bleak exhilaration" repetition borders on template cadence under peak stress, slightly diluting emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with unmistakable cost (lost counterclockwise gift) under causal lens; "slit the string" beat reconfigures options while "cracked hunger stone" crystallizes conceptual price—no orientation debt, escalation tightens via yoyo mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting dominates: hunger stone's weight shift and lighthouse gears constrain every choice, charging the final image (stone on bench); "slow exhale of low tide" motif evolves from atmospheric anchor to temporal pressure without white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping fate) tightens causally through yoyo failures, narrowing options until the slit-string reversal; cost is visceral in "traded prophecy for possibility" with tangible consequence (gift lost), no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cracked hunger stone and "clock that told no time at all" reweight fate vs. possibility without moralizing; final image offers resonant answer via "uncertain, alive, unwound" state, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time mechanics as sensory filter) with rhythmic control during time-folding climax; minor register drift in repeated "bleak exhilaration" slightly flattens voice modulation under extreme stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, high density ("yoyo descended, dragging hunger stone like a dying star"), but "bleak exhilaration" appears 3x in high-pressure beats, risking cadence monotony that narrowly avoids −0.2 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via yoyo escapement mechanics; "hunger stone tied to axle" is fresh inflection growing from prior drought imagery, with risk-taking (time-folding climax) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
