<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (salvation/suicide) embodied via rebreather-muffled trembling and "uncertain hands"; final choice earned through the 43-dot ritual's physical cost. No label-speak; "Damage accepted" crystallizes endurance with visceral chain snaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: workshop sinking while charm ascends reconfigures "meaning" via acid recoiling from healed marble. Accumulative lens holds—pattern-matching tightens options as chains snap, foreclosing survival path through Lira’s choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Acid sea actively constrains choices (breath-timing, chain corrosion) and charges the final image: workshop’s "hiss that sounded almost grateful" as it sinks. Micro-setting (porthole, velvet tray) directly shapes the ritual’s mechanics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (meaning vs. survival) signaled immediately via "not resurrection—but meaning." Agency-driven escalation: chain countdown forces Lira’s choice, narrowing options to "salvation or suicide" with workshop sinking as visible cost paid mid-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi-as-memory: "Memory endures beyond the vessel" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image (charm ascending as statue’s eyes open) offers resonant answer to "meaning" through concrete action, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "pockmarks like a star map of ruin" filters observation through alchemist’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—"puncture, translate, breathe, pray"—compresses diction without losing texture during chain snaps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("groaned," "fizzing," "clattered"). Final image’s "star reversing gravity" avoids figurative muddle—mercury’s "tiny sun" directly charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi applied to memory preservation transforms post-apocalyptic tropes. Emotional specificity in "quilting memories into a sigil" avoids generic hope; stakes rooted in Lira’s embodied grief, not world-ending clichés.</comment>
