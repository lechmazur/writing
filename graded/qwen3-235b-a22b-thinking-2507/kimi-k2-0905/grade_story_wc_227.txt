<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s micro-choices: her trembling hands versus steady narration, the charm’s "desperate sunrise" gleam against her terror. Final choice to sink the workshop earns closure through embodied cost—"Damage accepted. Meaning achieved."—with no therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: workshop sinks (felt cost) while charm ascends (conceptual cost), reweighting "meaning" as endurance beyond vessel. Accumulative lens holds via dot-counting ritual; "acid recoiled... as if ashamed" crystallizes irreversible stakes without causal loopholes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The rebreather mask constrains Lira’s breaths and speech, charging the final image: exhaled name absorbed by golden lacquer. Acid sea’s "fizzing" chains and "tectonic teeth" grinding evolve causally, with corroded statue’s pockmarks mirroring her internal fragmentation through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: each pockmark dot narrows options until "Chain one parted." Cost is unmistakable—"tools clattered toward the tilting deck"—and the acid’s rising tide forces the ultimate trade-off: statue’s healing versus workshop’s survival, crystallized in her strapped-in witness stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi’s physicality: "luminous scars" heal marble but transfer weight, rejecting resurrection for "meaning achieved." Final image—charm as "star reversing gravity"—resonates without moralizing; "Memory endures beyond the vessel" reweights loss as active endurance, not tidy solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: Lira notices "pockmarks like a star map of ruin" and "gold seams glinting like desperate sunrise," filtering crisis through alchemist’s lens. Rhythm compresses under stress ("puncture, translate, breathe, pray"), with "between breaths held underwater" refrains modulating psychic distance without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tectonic teeth grinding" and "hiss that sounded almost grateful" fuse metaphor with physical logic. Every sentence propels tension: "Chain two snapped. The workshop listed" uses abrupt syntax to mirror collapse. Final line’s "star reversing gravity" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms kintsugi from craft trope into visceral stakes: mercury-trapped heartbeat becomes active cost-driver. "Dire enchantment" tone deepens through "acid sea kissed the iron" and statue’s "calm, ancient, forgiving" eyes, avoiding derivative post-apocalyptic clichés via alchemist’s tactile specificity.</comment>
