<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the instructor’s grief/hope balance ("almost lied... but truth demanded"), embodied via water-muffled voice and rust-bled fingers. Boy’s characterization slightly thin but closure choice (releasing chain link) earns stakes through prior causality. No diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "direction begins where fear ends" crystallizes stance with felt cost in the chain link’s "hollow that ached like lungs." Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation clear by 80 words. Cost proof evident in the void’s physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Benthic city actively constrains choices (water resistance, plankton light), but "coral-wrapped towers" edges generic. Chain link as micro-setting charges closure: its absence becomes the "navigable void" reconfiguring hope. Meets 9+ gate via tool-driven constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when boy asks "can we go back?"—instructor’s truth ("learning is the only direction left") forecloses return with visceral cost (ache like "lungs remembering air"). Escalation driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; price shapes final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chain link’s evolution from relic to sextant to void reweights "horizons unfold" without moralizing. Final line’s "direction begins where fear ends" is earned non-literal answer; no thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("balancedly curious gaze," "somber marvel") and rhythmic control under pressure ("grinding it until a fresh metallic face caught the blue glow"). Purposeful compression taught early; zero head-hopping. Lyric mode pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("rust-bled fingers," "aliens folded space") but "balancedly curious" repetition creates minor paraphrase loop in para 1/6. No figurative muddle; final line’s propulsion ("ready to teach again") avoids closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific emotional calculus: navigation as resistance, not survival. "Edge geometry" synthesizes alien physics/human hope. Risk-taking (lyric structure, somber tone) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
