<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; locksmith's "unassumingly bold" trait faces no internal conflict during the mouth's refusal. Final renunciation (tying ribbon) lacks visible cost escalation beyond symbolic gesture, though embodied emotion in tracing stitches is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (hoofprints in minds), but cost proof test fails: no exact sentence/image shows price paid. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "I've already seen you free" feels unearned without prior causality for his certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus actively constrains choice (stepping backward disorients fear) and charges final image (glowing alleys). Midnight blue ribbon functions as micro-setting that evolves with plot, reweighting meaning when tied to his wrist as "part of the opener."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing peace) tightens meaningfully when the mouth trembles, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost. The locksmith's solution ("I've already seen you free") resolves tension without visible trade-off; agency feels passive against fear's resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final "What if?" reweights the central question without moralizing, using glowing hoofprints as resonant answer. Avoids thematic echo by embedding "improbable longing" in concrete actions (hair scent, river of starlight), though "idea of peace" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: locksmith notices "bruise in air" and "harp strings" shimmer, reflecting his trade. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("moths that dissolved into starlight"), with patterned elision (centuries of work) taught early and paid off in silver hair reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "dawn compressed... so small... yet so vast" stacks descriptors without advancing action. Otherwise flawless propulsion; "alley unfolded into roads" compresses transformation efficiently. Zero loops or scaffold in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "key to unlock fear" trope via specific mechanics (stitches→moths, anti-map navigation). Risk-taking succeeds: cosmic scale avoids gimmickry by rooting in tangible details (ribbon scent, forehead touch), though "enigmatic locksmith" archetype lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
