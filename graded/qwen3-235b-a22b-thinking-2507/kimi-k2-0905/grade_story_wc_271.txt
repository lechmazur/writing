<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through somatic mapping ("grief spikes I can press a thumb... and the pain pauses, confused"), avoiding therapy-speak via embodied action. Micro-choice of transferring photo to resin-sealed bark earns the final renunciation with visible cost in the image's release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density ("salt, eucalyptus, cold sweat") tightens into Earned Stasis closure where releasing the photo forecloses preservation with visceral cost ("tears come—reliable as tide"). Orientation anchors cliff setting by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Arboretum functions as active constraint—dragon’s-blood pine resin becomes ritual medium for sealing the photograph, directly charging the closure image. Micro-setting (photograph’s creases, resin smear) alters tactics through the transfer action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (grief vs. endurance) deepens via the freeze technique’s escalation into dissection ("a microscope"), narrowing options to release. Cost is unmistakable in the photograph’s seaward rip and somatic markers’ "glow" as new lighthouses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "grief is not a landmine... but a coastline to learn by heart" crystallizes into the final image of air tasting "of possible mornings," offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—botanist’s precision ("mallee eucalyptus, dragon’s-blood pine") fused with trauma’s narrowed focus. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("tears come—reliable as tide") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper" advances atmosphere and emotional state. "Somatic markers" risks clinical tone but is immediately redeemed by embodied action ("press a thumb to the scar").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via botanical somatic mapping—specificity of "dragon’s-blood pine resin" creates freshness without quirk. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes ("freeze the moment... to dissect it for mercy") while maintaining closure clarity.</comment>
