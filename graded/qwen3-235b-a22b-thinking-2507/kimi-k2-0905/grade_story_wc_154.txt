<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (thumb on cast, decrypting symbols), but the child remains slightly archetypal—"shrewdly innocent" lacks specific action constraints. Embodied emotions avoid therapy-speak, though moral ambiguity risks over-refinement in the final confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Conceptual Repricing: coral’s weight shift and "dew instead of blood" reconfigure trauma’s meaning with undeniable cost ("ache remained—it always would"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, though nurse’s arrival slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and coral fragment constrain choices—twilight droplets dilute ink during decryption, coral’s alignment charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (morphine haze narrows focus), but "banana leaves" lack tactical pressure beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through density: decrypted symbols (birthday, village) narrow options by forcing confrontation with guilt. Cost is visceral in "pulse stuttered; anesthetic could not dull that memory." Agency drives escalation via decryption, though secondary conflict (translator’s role) remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral’s evolving symbolism—reef memory becomes "sediment ready for growth"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("dew instead of blood") answers the central question non-literally, but "lotus-hearted ache" edges toward abstraction without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "cordite and apologies" taste, morphine-softened edges. Rhythmic control under pressure ("ink had run where sweat or tears had salted it") avoids lyric overindulgence. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but two template cadences ("shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent" followed by "pupils dilated...") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. "Gyres of shared anxieties" risks overwriting, though payoff in closure redeems it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coral as trauma-memory vessel transforms war-story tropes. Emotional specificity in "mistranslated massacre" backstory avoids genericity, but "lotus-hearted" ache verges on prompt-like abstraction without deeper integration.</comment>
