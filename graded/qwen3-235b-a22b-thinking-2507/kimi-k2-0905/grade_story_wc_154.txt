<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("graft new meaning") embodied through coral handling and voice choices earns the final renunciation; boy's "shrewdly innocent" trait lacks concrete tradeoff beyond tapping the coral, slightly weakening secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("sediment ready for new growth," coral "lighter now"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through coral/spiral alignment reweighting trauma, though midpoint lens inference requires close reading.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coral fragment constrains every key choice (pocketing, decryption, discharge note) and charges the final image; mist/banana leaves evolve causally with droplets diluting ink, avoiding static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single tightening ("pulse stuttered" at birthday realization) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost ("shared scar") legible but escalation relies solely on symbolic density rather than protagonist agency shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final coral alignment offers non-literal answer to "how trauma becomes growth" without moralizing; "sediment ready for new growth" reweights prior shrapnel imagery with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cordite and apologies," "syllables pool like rainwater") modulates under morphine haze; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's "quiet percussion of peace."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep" edges toward overwriting in peak beat; high density maintained except minor cadence stiffness in "confession, a ledger of collective guilt."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of coral as trauma/growth vessel feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric war story) heightens stakes through "reef memory" specificity without gimmickry, transforming Pacific conflict tropes.</comment>
