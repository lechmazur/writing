<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "learning to trust again" repetition feels earned through embodied dust-mote balancing; Inkspot's rice-paper diet reveals character-specific flaw in "feathery envelopes" backstory. Diagnostic label "reinvent her personal history" slightly undermines embodied motivation despite strong micro-choices like meteorite-chip concealment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with meteorite chip's "borrowed warmth" cradling lullaby etching—conceptual cost of erasure crystallized through dust motes' "unfinished cadence." Orientation debt waived as disorientation (camphor/sonatas opening) pays off in final dust ballet. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation to "quilt audible only to those willing to listen past sirens."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains all choices: dust motes teach balance, disbound atlases become pigeon perches, skylight's "blooming withering light" dictates movement windows. Final dust-chord image charges closure by reweighting the dominant stake—environment isn't backdrop but active pressure. Recurring mica glints evolve from memory triggers to balance tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Inkspot's micro-sheet deliveries narrowing Mirela's escape window; felt cost in "erasure and remembrance" balance. Constables' arrival lacks causal escalation (coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve), yet "widening gyre of dust" deepening shows earned pressure. Visible price: childhood apricot memories sacrificed for "rooftop leaps" freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pigeon-delivered fragments reassembling into jump-rope tunes—resonant answer to "preserve echo of lost songs" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by showing lullaby's survival via "crusts of bread" trades, not stating wisdom. Final dust chord charges prior material by embodying "identities like songs survive when set free" as actionable truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "oil-drop eyes that reflected attic’s blooming withering light" and meteorite’s "tasting iron." Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during constable arrival ("She was already gone..."). Elision of smuggling details taught early through "smoldering paper trails" metaphor paid off in Inkspot’s code-tapping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat but paraphrase loop in "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" triggers −0.3. High density throughout except "worlds survived collision" metaphor slightly overwrought. Final line’s "brief, bright chord—blooming, withering" avoids cliché through concrete causality (light angle aligns → dust rearranges).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier-pigeon smuggling with musical preservation avoids trope clichés; meteorite chip’s scientific specificity ("micro-etched stave") grounds magical realism. Bold risk in lyric structure where dust motes replace causal beats, yet "rooftop leaps" memory makes emotional truth specific. No derivative echoes despite vintage bookshop setting.</comment>
