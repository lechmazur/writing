<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cracked gear in her chest" metaphor, but "excruciatingly gentle" label repeats without showing evolving action under pressure. Final renunciation lacks visible cost escalation beyond stated emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost in the bear's splitting. Hidden sunrise motif doesn't tighten tactics, slightly weakening escalation under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choice (bear placement), charges final tree image. "Petrichor nostalgia" abstraction slightly dilutes otherwise tactile sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("abandoned dream") deepens credibly, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—environment magically responds rather than choices narrowing options. Cost (bear splitting) visible but externally imposed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("peace is quiet bearing of transformation") reweights the chronometer dream without moralizing. Linden tree's "slow breath of stars" crystallizes theme through concrete action, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glacial hush" as embodied metaphor) falters with "excruciatingly gentle" repetition loop. Rhythmic control weakens during seed-reveal beat under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" label appears three times as stock phrase; "petrichor nostalgia" creates abstraction muddle. Minor density issues in high-pressure beats but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "unfinished dream" trope through linden tree's chiming leaves—a specific, inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure's emotional cost.</comment>
