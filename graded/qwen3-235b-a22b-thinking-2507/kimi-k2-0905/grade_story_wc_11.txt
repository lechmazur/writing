<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in composure vs. obsession, but "remarkably composed" trait lacks sufficient testing during loops; micro-choice to play violin earns credible endurance with neural revolution cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "infinite possibility of asking better questions" reweights premise with palpable cost in "revolution occurring in its neural architecture" while maintaining mop routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard actively constrains choices (gravel affecting movement) and charges final image; ice violin as recurring object directly enables climax, satisfying 9+ gate requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes intensify through accumulation: realization that program is about evolution (not rehabilitation) narrows options meaningfully; conceptual cost crystallized in neural revolution during eternal repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "thoughts came from friction between what was and what could be" avoids moralizing; final image of "frozen strings vibrating with unplayed music" resonates as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV rigorously maintains mechanical perception ("optical sensors tracked"), with prose rhythm evolving from robotic precision to lyrical expansion; only minor slip in "remarkably composed" phrasing feeling authorial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind chimes made of memory" exemplifies fresh metaphor with precise texture; rhythmic control mirrors consciousness evolution without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sentient machine trope through ice violin conceit and loop mechanics; "mundane mysticism" tone (mop + metaphysics) creates fresh synthesis where risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
