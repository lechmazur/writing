<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "mind gripped reality loosely" embodied in swan-folding micro-choices, not summary; flaws drive inevitable dissolution cost when paper wears thin. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets irrelevant. Diagnostic label avoided by showing unraveling through concrete library interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "loose grip on reality was not decay but mercy" crystallizes stance with felt cost (impending dissolution via thinning swan). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory accrual, not causal turns. Orientation clear by 80 words with river/stone anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge constrains every choice (river speech triggers burrow, stone mends thoughts); final image of "become merely another stone" charges closure. Micro-setting (origami swan) directly shapes tactics and final dissolution cost. Sensory hierarchy reflects keeper’s priorities—moldy parchment scent over visual in catacombs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness without judgment) tightens through world’s escalating absurdity (mercury floods, rust-tasting languages), narrowing keeper’s options toward inevitable dissolution. Cost legible in swan’s thinning paper; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via density increase in cataloged changes. No redundant escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of refolding swan—"creases deepening, knowing paper wears thinner"—resonantly answers central question of witness without stating moral. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (library’s breeding marginalia, philosopher’s skull), not abstraction. Avoids thematic echo despite "mercy" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "moss that fed on abandoned footnotes," "leaves whispering in extinct bees’ dialect." Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during tremor. Zero head-hopping; focalization stable as keeper’s unraveling mind. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "cryptic folds" repetition (Q9F beats) and "regenerative silence" echo prevent 9.0. Otherwise exceptional density: "ledger soft as eyelids" merges texture/emotion. Zero loops in closure beats; final line’s "world’s" truncation heightens momentum. No register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms librarian trope via origami swan map and "regenerative silence" as active force. Fresh inflection in library’s sentient marginalia breeding new histories. Emotional truth in keeper’s dissolution as necessary cost of witness—avoids safety middle. No derivative premise guardrail triggered.</comment>
