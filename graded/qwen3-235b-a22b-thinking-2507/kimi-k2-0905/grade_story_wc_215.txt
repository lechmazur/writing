<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: Alden’s "tranquilly perceptive" trait manifests through embodied choices (palms catching soot motes, finger pressing fracture) not labels. Contradictory impulses (silence vs. whispered vow) earn the closure with visceral cost in the chest-pressure imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the whispered vow breaks Alden’s silence to reconfigure the covenant from burden to shared sweetness, crystallized by the blooming clover scent against scorched wasteland. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned word-weight accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: the stained glass box’s fragility dictates tactics (mending vs. abandoning), while the apiary ruins charge the final image (box in hive shell, clover scent blooming). Micro-setting (invisible jar, soot-stained finger) directly enables the covenant’s resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Alden’s agency: the propagating fracture forces the binary choice (mend/leave), tightening options via accumulated word-weight. Cost is visceral ("pressure equal to desert’s heat pressing against ribs") but slightly abstracted in the final resolution’s hopeful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "covenant as comb" metaphor reweights sweetness/bitterness via the sealed fracture, avoiding moralizing. Final clover scent offers non-literal answer to "unspoken words" without stating a moral, embracing complexity (preservation vs. release).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive" filters all observation (ash spirals as bees, violet-pane splinters). Rhythmic control under pressure—lyric cadence compresses without losing clarity ("hush heavier than honey poured onto the parchment").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "tranquilly perceptive" repeats 3x without deepening pressure. Figurative language stays coherent ("hush heavier than honey" avoids muddle), but "propagating like a lie" slightly strains the bee-wing fracture metaphor in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: beekeeping tropes transformed via ghostly "unspoken words" as tangible weight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal beats) heightens emotional stakes coherently, with the desert’s flowering proving conceptual integrity without gimmickry.</comment>
