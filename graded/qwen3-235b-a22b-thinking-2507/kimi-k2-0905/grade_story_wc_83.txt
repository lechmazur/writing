<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "harvesting unlived lives to fuel mechanical grief" versus bride's silent accusation, but "bleak exhilaration" lacks embodied specificity at peak pressure. Micro-choices like smashing circuit breakers reveal value hierarchies with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: the .003-degree redirection crystallizes Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost. "Intangibly tangible weight of all those futures" proves cost legibly, while circuit-breaker reset rhythm drives escalation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory’s micro-setting constrains every choice—circuit breakers create wind patterns, quantum telescope redirects grief into action. Final image of "unused potential pooling" charges closure through environmental causality, not symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: each geode fragment lost alters tactics (lighter body vs heavier crystal), narrowing options to the final dive. Cost is visceral in "crumbled into stardust that tasted like wedding cake" as tradeoffs escalate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—redirecting missiles via children’s math workbooks—not moralizing. Final image of "unused potential began its slow, inevitable pooling" offers resonant non-literal answer to grief-as-resource question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific precision ("perturbation theory") with raw grief ("geode pulsed like a second heart"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure; "circuit breakers requiring time to reset" modulates lexicon without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "helium sacs hissing as circuit breakers cooled" does triple duty advancing plot/atmosphere/momentum. Only hairline flaw: "intangibly tangible" slightly abstract in QD context, redeemed by later physical embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief mechanics and physics ("becoming perturbation myself") transforms tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes—the geode-as-grave-robbery metaphor avoids sentimentality while charging closure with emotional truth.</comment>
