<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in harvesting unlived lives versus wanting to save; 'mechanical grief' label risks therapy-speak but embodied cost in crumbling geode salvages motivation. Final renunciation of survival for becoming 'death's accountant' earns causal weight despite diagnostic phrasing in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the fall's .003-degree ripple redirects destruction while geode dust forms silent toasts, making conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds through density increase—each hunted fragment tightens the stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Geode constrains every choice from telescope contact to fragment sacrifice, charging the final image as wedding-guest dust. Observatory's circuit breakers and desert setting pressure tactics via wind patterns and reset timers, avoiding symbolic convenience through tangible causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist's agency—hunting faster costs geode fragments while sharpening moral calculus between harvesting grief and redirecting missiles. Cost crystallizes in the final image: becoming 'someone else's unfiltered awakening' with physical and conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hunted math equations and unplayed requiems, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights grief as generative force without resolution—desert rushing 'like a bride's embrace' offers resonant, non-literal answer to harvesting unlived lives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing 'circuit breakers cooling' and 'intangibly tangible weight' under stress. Rhythmic control sustains pressure through fragmented clauses ('I wasn't supposed to be here'), though 'mechanical grief' slightly jars POV lexicon consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in high-pressure beats, but 'mechanical grief' and 'death's accountant' verge on therapy-speak in peak moments. Propulsion remains strong despite one mixed metaphor ('grave robber of possibility'), with final image's desert-as-embrace avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perturbation theory with grief-harvesting avoids sci-fi tropes; 'unused potential' pools in arithmetic workbooks feel lived-in. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—geode's transformation from wedding gift to resource redefines emotional logic inevitably.</comment>
