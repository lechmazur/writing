<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maris’s embodied motivation (decoding the stranger’s debt) drives micro-choices like pinning/releasing the Edelweiss, with contradictory impulses in her ritualistic yet investigative stance. Minor deduction: stranger’s underdevelopment slightly weakens the debt’s emotional weight despite functional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the Edelweiss release closes gaps with visceral cost (eroded memories of mother/ship), under an Accumulative lens where gap-density escalates pressure. Orientation clear by line 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting that constrains action (swallowing sound, diffusing light beam) and charges the final image ("mist retained soft persistence"). Opal dock’s gleam as "closed eye" reweights prior erasure with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Maris’s agency observing gaps—each anomaly (silent gulls, missing ferry) tightens the debt cycle. Cost is unmistakable: alpine memories drain as she restores order, altering her isolation’s texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-debt emerges through Edelweiss handling, not moralizing. Final image ("opal dock gleamed like a closed eye") reweights "what is seen and erased" without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maris’s perceptual signature ("fog hums in a bell," salt-stained fingerprint) creates rhythmic control under pressure. Prose modulates from clanging boots to silent descent, embodying her shifting isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "tide slapped pilings with rhythm that left gaps" merges setting/character. Minor deduction for slight repetition of "borrowed memories," but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Risk-taking (time loops as debt mechanism) heightens stakes coherently, with Edelweiss transforming alpine/maritime tropes. Fresh synthesis in "loan, not gift" premise, though lighthouse trope slightly familiar.</comment>
