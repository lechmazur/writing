<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris’ contradictory impulses (decoding death vs. releasing memory) drive her final action; her embodied reaction to the fingerprint stain and maternal memory loss creates authentic cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: erasing maternal memories to "repay" the debt crystallizes the Accumulative lens. "Repaid" log entry and dock’s dream-like gleam reweight stakes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal dock/mist functions as micro-setting: tide accepting Edelweiss petals charges the final image, while "fog hums in a bell" embodies Maris’ perception under pressure, constraining her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via three gaps deepens the dominant stake (memory debt) under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable as alpine sun fragments take maternal memories—felt through action, not summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Edelweiss fragmentation: "lighthouse may remember what the sea forgets" becomes earned wisdom via Maris’ memory sacrifice, avoiding moralizing with resonant final image of dock-as-dreaming-eye.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fog hums in a bell," fingerprint as "glacier wind" stain) controls voice; syntactic rhythm mirrors tidal gaps, with no head-hopping despite temporal slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "petals like borrowed memories of alpine sun" charges both setting and closure. One borderline overwrought phrase ("milk stirred with silver") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through lighthouse-keeper specificity; "borrowed memories" debt mechanic feels inevitable via Edelweiss fragmentation, with risk-taking (temporal slippage) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
