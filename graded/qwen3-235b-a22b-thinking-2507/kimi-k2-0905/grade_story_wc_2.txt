<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “uncertainly certain” contradiction manifests physically in micro-choices (pocketing compass, wading into pool), with embodied cost (“chill climb his ribs like a ladder of mercury”). Flaw: minimal pre-cellar struggle limits flaw-complication depth despite credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (“uncertainty settle over him like ash that refused to fall”) under Accumulative lens. The 3:17 motif’s reprise in stopped clocks crystallizes stakes, but slight ambiguity in lens establishment precludes 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thames cellar’s damp stone and greenhouse leaves constrain choices (leaf spiral guides descent), while the compass rose charges the final image. Pocket watch’s rusted state directly shapes Elias’s climactic alignment decision with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pattern accumulation (3:17 leaf swirls → stopped clocks), with Elias’s agency driving the wading choice. Cost is unmistakable in relinquishing artifacts, though the single escalation beat limits 9.0+ eligibility despite perfect lens alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (leaving compass/watch), avoiding moralizing. The final tavern line (“time is just another waterfall”) risks thematic echo but earns resonance via prior particulars; slight overstatement caps score below 8.8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (“swirling leaves like green snow”), with rhythmic compression under stress (“He dunked his head”). Zero head-hopping; elision (Victorian navvies) taught early and paid off in the echo motif’s payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion (“boots skimming slate walkways”) avoids loops. “Chill climb his ribs” exemplifies textural specificity, though the navvies clause slightly over-explains without momentum loss, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time motifs (3:17 as both coincidence and salvation) transforms clock-tinkerer trope. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but thematic proximity to common uncertainty narratives prevents 9.5+ distinction.</comment>
