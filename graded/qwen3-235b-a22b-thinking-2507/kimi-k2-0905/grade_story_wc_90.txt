<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details like "bare feet barely kissing deck plates" and hair-threaded sail; contradictions manifest in joy forged from grief. Final renunciation of return carries visible cost but lacks micro-choice depth during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when vacuum tugs at her heels while she stays to tend the archive. Cost is visceral in "hatch began to close," though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) slightly clouds causality of the dimension-opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship hull blooming with "vines of light" constrains choice and charges final image. Micro-setting mastery: photographs as tools for stitching sail directly enable the dimensional breakthrough, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Sister Halcyon’s agency—stitching photos into sail narrows options to a single path. Cost is legible ("vacuum tugging at her heels"), but "ten billion deaths" remains abstract without tangible trade-offs during the act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "become a quiet lantern rather than a final bomb" reweights extinction through concrete action. Avoids moralizing; final image of humming woman makes sorrow/redemption inseparable without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "gravitationally lighter when happy" and "hull plates singing." Rhythmic control under pressure ("stitch the photographs into a sail, threading their edges") earns 9+ despite minimal dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with exceptional density: "thumb-sized droplet of glassy jade said to have fallen from the goddess’s cheek" layers meaning economically. Slight overwriting in "bruise in space" risks muddling but serves accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism as gravitational physics ("joy heavy enough to counterbalance ten billion deaths"). Transforms recycled spaceship trope through "seed rather than coffin" logic with emotional specificity in every detail.</comment>
