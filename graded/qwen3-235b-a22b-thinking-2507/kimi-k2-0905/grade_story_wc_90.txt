<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pacifist resolve fused with grief; micro-choices like stitching hair monofilament reveal values under pressure. Flaws: "shadow work" label risks therapy-speak, though embodied cost in tear fusion mitigates it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: vacuum tug + choosing to stay forecloses escape with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—photograph stitching intensifies emotional density toward dimension breach. No orientation debt; drive lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: hull plates singing under joy constrain tactics, while vines blooming charge the final image. "Gravitationally lighter" trait integrates flawlessly with environment. Only minor deduction: "star-pocked silence" edges toward generic celestial trope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Halcyon’s agency—stitching sail narrows options to joy-as-weight. Cost crystallizes in vacuum tugging as she chooses permanence. One meaningful deepening suffices, but escalation lacks secondary pressure point; pure internal conflict risks slight abstraction at this scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: photographs becoming living moments reweights "shadow work" without moralizing. Final image ("quiet lantern rather than final bomb") offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo—wisdom earned through tear fusion, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gravitationally lighter when happy" rhythms mirror her state. Lyric compression taught early ("hull stitched together from ribs") pays off in closure. Minor register drift in "collective shadow work" momentarily jars, but voice control under pressure remains impeccable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop in "fragile, defiant—joy flooded her" followed by "joy flooded her—not naive, but forged" dulls propulsion. High density otherwise; "thumb-sized droplet of glassy jade" exemplifies textural specificity. Final-third artifact caps 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms pacifist trope through concrete emotional physics: joy must carry grief’s weight. "Recycled spaceship as seed" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Near-echo of Buddhist iconography (Kwan Yin) is thoroughly recontextualized.</comment>
