<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in chip's reflection revealing alternate selves; micro-choice to leave shop unlocked earns renunciation with visible cost. Slight risk in "empirically, intuitively" phrasing edges toward clinical abstraction but redeemed by concrete "pulse in breast pocket" embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Elias sees his aging self: "loneliness was itself a choice made daily" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Orientation clear by line 3; creek's rising water creates relentless causal pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Matrix chip functions as micro-setting—shifting letter constrains choices, "O" recharges final image. Bioluminescent fungi pressure tactics via dimming light during decision; creek's swell alters navigation with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single stake ("step or not?") tightens via rising creek water forcing immediacy; ants' path disappearance creates earned reversal. Cost undeniable in "slow accretion of days like sediment" as he witnesses his own endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from map metaphors: "redrawn each morning" reweights premise without moralizing. Final "O" as zero/recognition mouth delivers non-literal answer to choice paralysis, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature perfect for map dealer: notices "crease and watermark," "granite scraping shoulders." Rhythmic control peaks in cavern sequence where short clauses mirror rising panic ("water seeping," "smell of earth").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "slow accretion of days like sediment" does triple duty as image/metaphor/closure. Only minor drift: "growing warmer with each step" slightly generic but redeemed by "pulse in breast pocket" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magic doorway" trope through map-dealer specificity: matrix chip as "negative space" key feels inevitable. Risk in ants guidance pays off via "golden thread" reprise charging final choice with earned stakes.</comment>
