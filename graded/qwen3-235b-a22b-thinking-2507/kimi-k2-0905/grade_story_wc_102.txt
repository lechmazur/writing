<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices: unloosing the jade bead to swing between them reveals her simultaneous fear of connection and need to heal. No diagnostic labels; the "hairline fracture" manifests physically in breath rhythms, not abstract emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: stepping through the wisteria door crystallizes the cost ("fracture knit... with coolness") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("twilight viaduct," "foggy lucidity from river") avoid penalty; lens holds through orchard transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wisteria evolves from choking arches to "drinkable" scent that thickens with shared breath, directly constraining the pivotal breathing exercise. Final image of the viaduct "glowing softly from the inside" charges closure through setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: matching the man's breath rhythm (not coincidence) triggers the wisteria glow and orchard transition. Cost is visceral—"fracture knit... as though unused love was river water returning"—with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the orchard's "fruit" of withheld kindness, avoiding moralizing. Final image of distributed love droplets offers non-literal resolution: "road ahead smelled equally of wisteria and beginning" reweights "unused love" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "petals drifting like slow fireworks," "breathing changes reveal what the eye edits out." Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato phrases during the man's arrival ("coat buttoned wrong, eyes reflecting...")—with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line does triple duty (e.g., "wisteria scent... tasted purple, medicinal, almost able to heal"). Final line’s "transparent" breath recharges opening’s "purple" sensation without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "unused love" trope into tangible fruit; specific details like jade tied with "silk so old it had forgotten its dye" avoid quirkiness. Risk-taking (breath as healing method) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
