<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives micro-choices like renaming filaments; flaw (wrong seeds) compounds through emotional cost when gravity slackens during edit. Final endurance of uncertainty earns closure with felt cost in "trembling" voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "each step a sentence in a story still being written" crystallizes options with cost (eternal uncertainty), but conceptual cost lacks concrete legibility at the final beat. Orientation anchors by word 40 ("Station Lagrange-9") avoid penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dried pen) constrains choice: its "dryness" forces etching "absence that glowed," charging the final image where Mira "capped the nib." Anomaly’s silver flare evolves causally with plot, affecting action when gravity slackens during edit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake ("confidently uncertain" interpretation) tightens through pen vibration and gravity slackening; Mira’s agency in renaming filaments narrows options. Cost remains conceptual (eternal uncertainty) but lacks visceral weight in closure image despite "trembling" voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "wrong seeds" becoming "early" via concrete action, not moralizing. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost ("gentle uncertainty"), but "Interpreter to Cosmos" log risks thematic echo without sufficient dramatic friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glyphs sprouted into static," "ink was metaphor") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts with anomaly’s flare—short clauses during gravity slackening—while elisions (mentor’s dialogue) are taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but "reservoir thirsting for ink that had never been refilled because ink was metaphor" violates physical logic (empty reservoir can't thirst), causing coherence penalty. Final line’s "sentence still being written" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Ink was metaphor" transforms trope through specific world logic; emotional truth in "prune the wrong branch" memory avoids generic gardening allegory. Risk-taking (editing via filaments) heightens stakes without gimmickry but "strange comfort" leans slightly toward middle-ground hedging.</comment>
