<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through synesthetic mapping ("grief for widows... own interior stayed blank"), but micro-choices lack visible trade-offs during the spiral approach; embodied emotion avoids labels yet the final kneeling feels slightly preordained rather than wrestled with.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "become the map" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with cost ("memorizing topography... ridges of joy, valleys of regret"), though the stillpoint transition lacks one tangible pressure point narrowing options before the clearing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The platinum ring constrains every choice (dowsing path, absorbing vibrations) and charges the final image ("ring catching first light"), but the ultrasonic forest’s pressure on tactics could deepen beyond sensory description; "moss" and "canes" anchor micro-setting effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping unmapped emotions) tightens through the spiral’s intensifying notes, but escalation lacks a concrete mid-scene trade-off; cost ("memorizing topography") feels earned yet the forest’s "tightening walls" remain atmospheric rather than actively raising stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights the theme non-literally: "quiet blaze inside him kept perfect, fearless time" answers "navigate emotional depths" through embodied cartography, avoiding moralizing while the ring’s transformation ("weightless" to "empty") crystallizes earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("taste frequencies as citrus," "Braille of sound") remains fiercely consistent, with rhythm accelerating during the spiral; minor deduction as the stillpoint’s "sound inverted" momentarily drifts from tactile POV into omniscient description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "syllables sinking through pores like warm ink" risks metaphor collision but gains coherence through synesthetic voice; only flaw is "bloomed into a new melody" (slightly generic verb) in the climax beat where specificity is paramount.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind cartographer trope transformed via ultrasonic synesthesia creates fresh emotional mapping logic; the "quiet blaze" motif avoids cliché by charging both conflict (notes "pressing against ribs") and closure ("fearless time"), though "stillpoint" concept echoes spiritual tropes without full reinvention.</comment>
