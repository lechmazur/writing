<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s rooftop loneliness versus her drive to alleviate villagers’ fear; her "weight settle inside her chest" embodies embodied emotion. Final choice to release the pearl feels earned through prior micro-choices like whispering the constellation name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the pearl dissolving into "sigh" weight while villagers receive quiet light crystallizes cost. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout with sensory density tightening toward the drip-triggered transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sea glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its shift from "reflectively vibrant" to "matte and ordinary" reweights the entire arc. Mist’s tactile behavior ("parted like curtains") constrains Lira’s actions while mirroring emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency: polishing the glass initiates the mist’s reaction, and the seawater drop’s precision proves her effort matters. Cost is unmistakable in the pearl’s dissolution as "sigh" weight and the villagers’ transformed fear into wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "light without fire" resolves not as moral but as dandelion-seed shafts carrying rooftop silences. Final image reweights "pearl of stillness" into "weighing nothing, lighting everything" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite—Lira’s astronomer eyes see "lunar crater" eyes in the mirror. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fugitive glimmers, like fireflies unsure of their direction") avoids lyric cliché while teaching patterned elision early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "zephyr bloom cool" transforms expected thermal imagery without muddle. Final line’s cadence ("weighing nothing, lighting everything") achieves maximum propulsion with crystalline clarity, recharging the sea glass motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "starlight" tropes through tactile specificity: calcite veins pulsing like heartbeats, pearl as "slow-moving vortex of hush." Emotional truth in villagers’ fear of light without burning feels fresh, not derivative.</comment>
