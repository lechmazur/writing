<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s "negative space" fixation and silent sketching, but "hospital monitors" feels anachronistic and slightly abstracts emotion; micro-choices (choosing left fork, offering pendant) earn the renunciation’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mira touching the syllable snaps time taut with conceptual cost (surrendered future), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored by "rooftop canal system" within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals actively constrain choices (walking upstream, fork decision), charge the final image, and evolve causally (reversing flow); micro-setting as "tool" meets 9+ gate by shaping every tactical move under time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating density (shifting gargoyles, wisteria bridge "reimbursing seconds") under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable when pendant drips into canal as "tiny boats of digits" carrying her future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of painting "the doorway" offers resonant non-literal answer to memory/release; avoids moralizing by showing the sealed pendant as "simple reminder" that debts are paid by freeing memories, not tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "gargoyles reshuffling wings into positions they had held last Tuesday"; minor register drift with "hospital monitors" slightly disrupts world consistency under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high propulsion ("ripples climbing backward like silverfish"), but "unborn echoes suspended like a diver mid-air" creates a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes time-borrowing and echo mythology into fresh emotional calculus; "giant’s nap" pressure transforms familiar tropes through specific mechanics (ledger balancing, cadence breath patterns) that feel inevitable.</comment>
