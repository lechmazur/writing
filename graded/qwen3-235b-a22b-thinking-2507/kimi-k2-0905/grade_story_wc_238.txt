<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mirage’s micro-choices (e.g., forbidden pen use), but Julian’s embodied emotion lacks specificity beyond "pressed flower" abstraction, slightly muddying mutual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Mirage’s identity dissolution ("gossip drain like ink") and the orchard’s "first and last song" crystallize irreversible stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sheet music archive constrains every choice (ink absorption, staff paper confession), while the perfume bottle charges the final image—orchard air becoming "bergamot brightness" reweights prior motifs with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the orchard’s looming bulldozing, but Julian’s "public domain" revelation lacks sufficient escalation pressure; the apology’s fading feels more lyrical than causally constrained by the timeframe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the smudged treble clef and weeping instruments, reweighting "haunting sells better than hurting" without moralizing—final orchard sap pulse embodies earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "skipped record" voice and "copper and prelude" synesthesia, though Julian’s dialogue slightly converges with Mirage’s lexicon during the apology beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, but "the way moonlight smiles on broken glass" slightly overwrites peak emotion; otherwise, propulsion ("chainsaw coughed awake") and density ("ink bleeding into perfect treble clef") are exemplary under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gossip journalism with exorcism tropes avoids gimmickry; the orchard’s "unripe fruit chord" as closure image feels inevitable yet revelatory in hindsight.</comment>
