<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlo's scholarly defiance is vividly embodied through micro-choices like planting the seed "two knuckles deep," but interior contradiction remains underdeveloped—his "spark of defiance" motivation stays abstract rather than manifesting as competing impulses in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the rooftop "flowering sentences" crystallize the cost of taxed thoughts; the satellite deadline creates relentless Accumulative pressure, and the final image of citizens feeling "untaxed thoughts unfurl" delivers undeniable conceptual cost without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices—Voss' intrusion forces Arlo to "slip sideways" using warp residue—and the firefly-cursive "Resist" glyph charges the closure by transforming loam into subversive text, perfectly meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation hinges on Arlo's agency under Accumulative pressure: the satellite pass deadline narrows options to a sprint across gardens, with visible cost in his "lighter" seed pouch; the inspector's intrusion deepens stakes by threatening immediate capture during glyph planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the "candidly cryptic" warning and refunded dreams—not moralizing; the final image of citizens encountering untaxed thoughts reweights the tax metaphor into a resonant answer about hope's inherent value, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlo's scholarly voice permeates syntax ("Lucretius on the swerve of atoms") and perceptual bias (orchid bees as "tiny tax auditors"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful compression ("seed pulsed, drinking his taxed imaginings") while maintaining consistent focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose excels in density and propulsion—"gourd rattle seed clicked like a clock counting down to chaos"—though "converging chaos pressurized inside a jar" risks mixed metaphor; zero scaffold or loops, with final line's "ransom for freedom" crystallizing thematic weight without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through entomological specificity (orchid bees as tax auditors) and the secret language's living patterns; the "thoughts as taxable" premise gains freshness via Arlo's scholarly rebellion, avoiding derivative middle-ground hedging with bold conceptual stakes.</comment>
