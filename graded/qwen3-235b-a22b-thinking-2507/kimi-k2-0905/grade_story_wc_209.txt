<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("frost settle on her eyelashes," "slow drip of old grief") and contradictions manifest through embodied choices (lying under branches to become part of the glass). Final renunciation—leaving the pavilion after understanding shadow's role—is causally earned by her grief-melting realization, with visible cost in the "umbral tenderness" that "made her chest ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing: "the dark remembers what the day forgets" reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost (the "slow drip of old grief"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—density increases via frost/snow/moonflower vignettes—culminating in the resonant "shadow is the root of the glow" line where cost is legible in her melted winter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (lying under branches to simulate rose windows) and charges closure (glass "singing with indigo vines"). Earth's "umbral tenderness" mirrors her internal state with causal pressure—the dark soil directly triggers her chest-aching recognition, fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative deepening: the "dawning hush" quest narrows options as winter recedes, forcing her to "reckon with absence." Agency drives every beat (pining postcards, collecting branches), with cost legible in physical hardship ("frost on eyelashes") and emotional vulnerability ("old grief she had never painted"). Pressure crystallizes when moonflowers reveal "the answer had never been about light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: moonflowers' "small fists," violet ink, and "umbral tenderness" avoid abstraction. The final image reweights everything—pavilion glass holding "garden’s reflection and its inverse"—without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to "why flowers bloom at night" via the shadow-glow reciprocity. No thematic echo; cost is embedded in the perfume "tasting like violet ink."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV has a painterly perceptual signature ("copper ribs," "translucent sky") with rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during frost ("She sat among them") contrast lyrical flows in epiphany. Elision (skipping months) is taught early ("February thawed into March") and pays off in the moonflower climax. Minor repetition of "quietly driven" slightly dilutes voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines do triple duty (e.g., "snow retreated inch by inch, exposing earth so dark it looked wet" conveys time, setting, and emotional charge). Final image’s "indigo vines" recharges the postcard motif with high density. One near-synonym cluster ("soft as sifted ash"/"quilt of white") slightly muddles momentum but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms the artist-in-residence trope through specific, grounded details: postcards as teaching tools, indigo painting on glass, and "umbral tenderness" as emotional lexicon. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the melted winter inside her feels inevitable, not derivative. Freshness anchored in verifiable details like bark resembling cathedral leading.</comment>
