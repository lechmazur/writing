<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete (frost on eyelashes, bark like cathedral leading), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; grief's "no outline" deepens motivation yet the final realization lacks competing drives that would elevate to 9.0. Micro-choices like arranging branches reveal values, but single-POV limits pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "winter begin to melt inside her, a slow drip of old grief" crystallizes the felt cost of her epiphany. Accumulative lens holds throughout—seasonal progression tightens pressure—though the midpoint lacks explicit lens teaching, barely avoiding ambiguity penalty. Orientation clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: frost forces cot setup, snow's retreat dictates moonflower observation, amber panes enable painted shadows. Final image of "indigo vines" blooming on glass charges closure by making environment the thematic answer. Micro-setting (postcards' etched glass) directly shapes the climax's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure—waiting for moonflowers becomes reckoning with grief—but remain internal/abstract, lacking visceral escalation. Agency manifests as sustained attention, yet the cost ("slow drip of old grief") feels conceptual rather than embodied, narrowly missing 9.0's "unmistakable" cost requirement under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "shadow waters it" postcard reweights into "shadow is the root of the glow" without moralizing. Final image ("glass holding garden’s reflection and its inverse") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "why flowers bloom at night," though "umbral tenderness" risks sentimentality without sufficient counterbalance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow soft as sifted ash," "buds shut tight like small fists") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Single-POV consistency shines in lyrical compression ("letting their beams fracture into spectral petals"), though slight register drift in "umbral tenderness" (repeated 3x) prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("first snow came early, soft as sifted ash, and she watched it erase the garden") propels without muddle. Minor figurative risk ("umbral tenderness" as near-metaphor) pays off in closure, but "quietly driven" adverbial phrase in opening slightly dilutes momentum—hairline slip preventing 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's epiphany" trope through specific sensory logic (postcards→painted glass→moonflowers), with "reckon with shadow" fresh inflection. Emotional truth anchors universals, but core premise ("understand nocturnal blooms") lacks sufficient risk-taking to breach 9.5; avoids derivative tropes through lived detail like bark-as-cathedral-leading.</comment>
