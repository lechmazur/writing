<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in scar cartography and darkroom ritual; micro-choices (scalpel opening, fixer writing) manifest contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. The boiling-water memory’s sensory specificity ("time rarefied into a corridor") earns the final renunciation of erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "borders of pain redrawn as borders of belonging" crystallizes the stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. Lightning-revealed scar-coastline creates undeniable cost; the fixer-etched writing on stone fulfills Earned Stasis with visible chemical erosion as price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Darkroom trays and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain choices (enlarger adjustments, paper-plane folding). The stormlit observatory actively pressures action—wind rotates the dome, lightning triggers the scar projection—making environment indispensable to the final image’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the "vigil in pause" concept: censored lines "trying to remember their original shape" tightens options until lightning forces the scar-coastline revelation. Agency peaks when the poet speaks the forbidden stanza, paying cost via the burning plane—coincidence (lightning) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar cartography transforming into belonging; the final stanza ("we become weather") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo by embedding insight in the plane’s ash-letters and mirror vibrations, making trauma’s reconfiguration visceral rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via photographic lexicon ("silver halide ghosts," "negative image") and stress-distorted time ("thunder rarefied the air"). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("furiously tranquil precision") to fragmented urgency during the lightning strike, with no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rarefied air" and "cartography of scars" recur with accumulating weight. Figurative language serves pressure ("censored passages bloom like fresh bruises") without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "violet flashes printed silver halide ghosts" narrowly avoids density penalty through precise chemical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms censorship tropes via photographic alchemy—scars as developable negatives, bus timetable as poetic vessel. The stormlit observatory’s fusion of scientific and traumatic weather feels inevitable. Risk-taking (fixer writing, ash-letters) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored in concrete darkroom physics.</comment>
