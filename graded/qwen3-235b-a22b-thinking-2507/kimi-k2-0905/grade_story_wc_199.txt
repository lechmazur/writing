<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("no thirst for glory" vs world-altering action) embodied through seed-sorting micro-choices under physical strain; final naming earned by precise monument-building labor with visible cost in trembling knees and expended effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: naming "Reciprocity" triggers tree descent and first raindrop with undeniable conceptual cost—the dissolved hush proves irrevocable change. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as leaf-decoding density forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonstone dust constrains choices (weighting leaves) and charges closure (kernel gleam); the arbor's descent reconfigures its opening "ashen" state into "umber" vitality, making environment inseparable from the covenant's restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mireya’s agency: each monument built against drifting height narrows temporal options, culminating in the gust-flung keyleaf. Cost is legible in her trembling yet precise hands and the irrevocable dissolution of the "hush where past meets prophecy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the monuments' transformation into "seed of memory"—the final image of weeds "remembering" they were healing herbs reweights reciprocity as active, embodied practice, avoiding moralizing while resonating with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "mossy delight" tune mirrors soil renewal, while syntax compresses under pressure ("knees trembled, yet her hands stayed precise"). Zero head-hopping; arbor’s "cold soot that tasted of old thunder" filters world through seed-sorter’s tactile lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line propels: "cloth smoldered gently, not with heat but with promise" compresses transformation into concrete image. Figurative language ("frost rewrites a window overnight") deepens meaning without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: seed-sorting precision applied to folklore decoding transforms "forgotten covenant" trope. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes—monuments as memory-seeds feel inevitable, resisting abstraction through kernel-level specificity.</comment>
