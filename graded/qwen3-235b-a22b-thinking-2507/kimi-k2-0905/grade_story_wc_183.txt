<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically (left foot/heights vs. right foot/depth) with embodied emotion; micro-choices like gathering heat-spots as breadcrumbs earn the final recitation. However, the embedded sister remains passive until climax, slightly weakening the mutual agency promised by "two throats."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates through memory rewinding and narrative shard accumulation toward Charged Poise closure where cost (sinking ship) crystallizes their unity. The final emerald-fire name-writing reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival ship functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (rotting plush footfalls, mirror-maze navigation) and charges the final image (ship as comma/submerging carousel). Recurring brass poles and emerald card root closure in tangible decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapturing name fragments) tightens through protagonist agency as she stitches narrative threads, narrowing options toward the recitation climax. Sinking ship’s visible cost (water rising through podium) forecloses escape while enabling buoyancy—a trade-off earned by prior accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden of forgotten names resolves as "past imperfect, forever growing"—a resonant, non-literal answer to identity fragmentation. Final image (lily spelling pollen-letter) avoids moralizing while charging prior motifs with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters decay through chimera physiology ("sister’s face bulged beneath skin"); rhythmic control sustains pressure during high-stakes recitation. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" metaphors barely avoids academic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("barkers cried prizes that exploded into pigeons") propels momentum. One borderline overwritten phrase ("lions of light pacing behind bars of forgotten laughter") risks muddle but pays off in closure’s earned stasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival limbo and linguistic rebirth transforms chimera trope; risk-taking (body-as-setting, name-as-plant) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "aberrant, blissful becoming" avoids generic identity themes.</comment>
