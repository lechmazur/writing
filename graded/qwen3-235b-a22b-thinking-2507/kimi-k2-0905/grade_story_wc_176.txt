<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in guilt vs preservation drive; embodied emotion ("tears freezing into delicate lenses") avoids labels. Micro-choices under pressure (warming rope strands) reveal hierarchy of values. Single-character constraint limits relationship depth but flawlessly executes interiority baseline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: voices becoming "moving air" with visible cost ("lighter by guilt, heavier by cargo"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through rope reconfiguration until aurora flare. Orientation clear by word 40; causality flawless as card fragility necessitates rope method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum actively constrains choices: frozen ropes require warming, snowmelt dissolves card. The punched card functions as micro-setting—its fragility dictates the rope threading method. Final image of names dissolving into "moving air" charges closure through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: reconfiguring rope braids narrows options to one fragile solution. Cost crystallizes when voices transfer to glacial wind ("heavier by cargo"). Pressure tightens via card’s physical limits and approaching dawn, making "snowmelt ardor" a live clock altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: preservation as "continuing vibration" shown via rope braids drinking card patterns. Final image ("tasted each name on my tongue like thaw water") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through embodied struggle (threading frayed rope ends).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: technical lexicon ("lost wax caster," "névé") blends with poetic compression ("aurora pulsed like a slow heartbeat"). Under stress, syntax tightens ("Working by aurora’s shifting lantern..."). Zero filter verbs; "petrified incense" taste grounds abstract emotion in character-specific bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances story/atmosphere ("tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled" does triple duty). Figurative language purposeful: "map of negative stars" recharges closure. Final line’s "thaw water" reprise avoids overwriting while charging motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "preserving memory" trope via specific mechanics: punched holes as phonemes, rope braids as sound conduits. "Technically gentle" trait avoids gimmickry by constraining actions (slower card handling). Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—casting expertise directly enables the ritual.</comment>
