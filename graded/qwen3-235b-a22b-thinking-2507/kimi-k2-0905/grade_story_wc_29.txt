<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete sensory contradictions ("velvet migraine," "tasted of copper") and micro-choices (glacier recording pivot), though "cosmic tricksters" risks label-speak but is redeemed by embodied cost in sweat and tactical sacrifice. Final endurance earns stasis with palpable cost: "power plays merely paused." No second character negates relationship bullets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: "power plays merely paused" crystallizes cost while "faintest tremor of returning civility" charges the final image. Causal lens holds throughout—Lyra’s actions narrow options (sine wave → glacier recording) with visible stakes. Orientation anchored crisply at 38 words; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>University radio station functions as micro-setting: the tower and generator directly enable Lyra’s counter-signal, while astronomical charts constrain timing choices. Final image ("grit... cradle") recharges the setting’s meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory details like "burnt solder" filter through her technical urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Lyra’s agency: her switch to glacier recordings (a "sacrifice of certainty") deepens the conflict when tricksters adapt. Cost is unmistakable—"power plays merely paused" and her exhaustion—while the 02:17 deadline tightens tactics. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "interference... another word for love" resonates because it’s earned by Lyra’s gritty lullaby, not stated moral. Avoids false balance (tricksters remain harmful) and rejects tidy resolution. Final image reweights "grit" as hope without sentimentality, though Q7’s minor flaw caps this band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in Lyra’s technical-poetic lens ("charts mapped the silence," "ethereal grit"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (staccato during climax: "Sweat salted... retuned"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "subsonic tremor in her chest" pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion remains taut ("yanking the cord until the engine coughed awake"). Minor deduction: "dolphin-quick hops" strains metaphor coherence near climax but doesn’t dull closure. Final line’s "grit... cradle" crystallizes theme with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: subsonic manipulation of civil unrest feels inevitable through Lyra’s expertise. Risk-taking (science-meets-lyricism) heightens stakes—"glacier calving" as weaponized chaos transforms tropes. Specificity ("37 hertz," "chipped silver coin") anchors universals without quirk.</comment>
