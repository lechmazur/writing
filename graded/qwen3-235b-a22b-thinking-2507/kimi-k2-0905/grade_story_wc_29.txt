<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in observed manipulation patterns, but "they couldn't comprehend genuine altruism" reads as diagnostic label-speak in peak beat without embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (terror/cautious hope) drive choices, yet Mara's competence lacks sufficient struggle against cosmic-scale stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost ("permanent enemy" status), but cost proof test fails—the retreat of entities feels externally resolved rather than earned through Mara's final action. Lens holds as Causal (interference→healing), yet entities' vulnerability lacks prior causal setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>University radio station functions as micro-setting: outdated equipment enables counter-signals, headphones transmit vibrations, water heater hides journal. Charts constrain choices (orbital corrections inform timing), but "impossible corrections" lack tactile integration beyond exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eroding trust) tightens through lunar eclipse deadline, with visible cost (Mara's permanent enmity). However, escalation relies on entities' convenient vulnerability during eclipse—a late rule change not grounded in prior causality, weakening agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (subsonic division, false dichotomies), but final line "cosmic con artistry" risks thematic echo. Strength lies in tricksters feeding on belief, yet resolution oversimplifies by turning anger outward without lingering ambiguity about human susceptibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in technical details ("subsonic frequencies vibrate through her bones"), but stress-induced compression flattens voice during climax ("fought to maintain control"). Focalization stays consistent, though "cosmic comedians" exposition feels narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("crystallized," "veered"), but "ethereal grit of the moment" is abstract filler. Minor synonym churn in "cautiously hopeful" descriptions, and "neural manipulation" disrupts POV lexicon with clinical diction during high pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic horror via subsonic psychology and academic setting. Fresh inflection in tricksters as belief-parasites, though "cosmic comedians" trope slightly undercuts originality. Avoids safety middle by making Mara's victory temporary (permanent enemy status), but community healing feels too neat.</comment>
