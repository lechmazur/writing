<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "archaeological duty, not belief" versus demanded participation; embodied emotion in "knocking over telescope" reaction. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "crowded with tenderness" closing description lacking visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Mara was alone yet crowded with tenderness" crystallizes irreversible cost of surrendered skepticism. Accumulative lens holds through midnight whale-song resonance; cost proof evident in transcribed symphony replacing academic transcription.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tower walls becoming "porous" actively constrains choice by admitting sensory memories; tide pool release of tile charges final image. Micro-setting (astrolabe alignment) directly shapes tactics while whale-song "braided with wind" demonstrates environment as pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake (skepticism vs. demanded connection) tightens meaningfully when tile lifts at midnight. Escalation driven by Mara’s agency—choosing to listen, aligning astrolabe—culminates in ink flowing "for the choir inside her" with visible cost of abandoned academic purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unheard symphony" motif reweighted by final whale response; avoids moralizing via concrete action (transcribing staves, not digits). Final image of "sky like parchment" offers resonant non-literal answer to "sculpt space for reflection" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "lapis numbers that crawled when viewed sideways"; rhythmic control peaks in "ink flowed into shapes... scored for tide, heartbeat." "Courageously kind" risks abstraction but redeemed by immediate action (righting telescope).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hairsbreadth above the table" demonstrates precise textural specificity. Minor deduction for "courageously kind" phrasing—elevated diction briefly clashes with POV lexicon before action justification.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artifact" trope through scientific framing (astrolabe, archaeological duty); "keel stone" concept as compass for "oceans of time" feels inevitable in hindsight. Whale migration as temporal pressure device avoids safety-middle hedging.</comment>
