<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s sensory loss fuels authentic contradiction (memory vs proof, professional identity vs new role), but her epiphany about the screw’s origin edges toward convenient imagination rather than earned struggle. Micro-choices like rotating the screw show hierarchy of values, though the transition from despair to insight lacks sufficient friction in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Mira rotates the screw toward the float—a crystallized stance with felt cost (permanent smell loss now reframed). Orientation anchors immediately ("morning fog"), but the screw’s backstory relies on Mira’s speculation rather than textual evidence, slightly weakening causality in the pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The water clock’s mechanics actively constrain choices: its dripping sound shapes Mira’s perception ("breath held between contractions"), and the screw’s micro-scratches charge the final image. Fog transforms the shop into a "diaphragm," directly mirroring her emotional state while guiding her tactile investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mira shifts from analyzing the screw to repositioning it—a meaningful choice that forecloses passive observation. Cost is visceral (tears, "hollow nose"), but escalation leans slightly on Horace’s absence rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the "panic" metaphor risks abstracting the concrete birth trauma it references.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the screw’s transformation from artifact to "spindle of unseen wonders," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("maps drawn by loss as much as landmark") reweights the premise with conceptual cost—Mira’s sensory deprivation becomes a lens for meaning—without stating a moral, though "trembling calm" risks thematic echo if overemphasized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has a distinct perceptual signature ("bottled dawn itself," "ticking ghosts") filtered through Mira’s sensory deprivation. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in fragmented clauses during her realization, but "reading between lines of metal she could no longer scent" slightly over-explains the central motif, nudging toward tell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("gurgled, its descending float marking seconds with drops instead of hands"). Minor overwriting in "micro-scratches spiraling outward like the panic in a delivery room" risks mixed metaphor (scratches as panic), and "motivation to unveil ordinary miracles flickered" uses abstract phrasing that dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes through Mira’s sensory loss: the water clock repair shop becomes a crucible for redefining meaning, and the birthing screw motif synthesizes medical and temporal imagery in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking (sensory deprivation as narrative engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the "loss as gift" arc flirts with sentimentality.</comment>
