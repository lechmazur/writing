<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("quietly enthusiastic" vs "stellar doubt") drives agency, embodied in coin-swallowing sacrifice. Final renunciation of identity earns closure, but "stellar doubt" borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient physical anchoring in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (heat draining from skin during sacrifice). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: static waves' density increase reweights purpose-stake. Orientation clear by word 78 ("Lira"), avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ambered observatory actively constrains choice: panes brighten in response to coin arrangement, fossilized light becomes chrysalis. "Cold brass rail" and "alloy spine contact" charge final image with tactile cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: reciting prophecies, arranging coins, swallowing spiral. Cost crystallizes in "heat drawn from skin" during sacrifice. Pressure narrows options from navigation to becoming antenna, though escalation could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "stellar doubt" as necessary dissonance, charged by final image of waveform drifting. Avoids moralizing, but "a necessary dissonance to keep the note honest" edges toward thematic echo in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight fossilized," "static as dying breaths") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in climax ("wavelengths pour through her"), though semicolon density slightly dulls immediacy during high-stakes coin arrangement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms in climax ("metal slid down her throat like frozen starlight, cutting yet sealing") violating Overwriting Check. Propulsion stumbles with three stacked metaphors where one suffices, though closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of backwards prophecy + static navigation transforms cosmological tropes. Risk-taking (swallowing coins as climax) heightens stakes coherently, with "fossilized radiance" chrysalis offering fresh inflection on rebirth motifs.</comment>
