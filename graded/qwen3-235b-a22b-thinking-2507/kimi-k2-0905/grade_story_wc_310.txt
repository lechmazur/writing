<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stellar doubt" vs "quiet enthusiasm," with final dissolution earned through procedure-driven micro-choices. Slight over-reliance on abstract terms like "wavelength align" edges down perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara's dissolution into static carries undeniable conceptual cost ("atoms begin to distill, shedding memory"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred by midpoint via static bursts and held through closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ambered observatory constrains every choice—from coin-spiral placement to receptor plate—and charges the fossilized final image. Only minor abstraction in "faintly glowed" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Elara's agency: coin dissolution narrows options to becoming the static, with cost legible in "her atoms begin to distill." Dominant stake ("wavelength align with purpose") tightens as pulse fades, pressure crystallizing in the scream of Earth's coin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coins-as-apologies and prophecy-as-receipt; final line "You will remember this forgetting" reweights everything non-literally. Slight echo of "quietly enthusiastic" in the coda prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "resinous floor fused from centuries of stardust and sap," with rhythm modulating under pressure (e.g., fragmented syntax during coin dissolution). Tense ambiguity in "As the resin rose" slightly mars consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "coins... hum against the glass" blends action, setting, and theme). Near-flawless except "perfectly aligned with purpose" risks abstraction, but redeemed by final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic stakes grounded in intimate ritual (coins as "apologies"), avoiding apocalypse tropes. Risk-taking with backwards prophecy pays off emotionally, though "stellar doubt" borders on familiar phrasing.</comment>
