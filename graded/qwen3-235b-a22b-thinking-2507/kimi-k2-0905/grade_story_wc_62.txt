<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradictions (carver using softness, meditative urgency) and earned closure choice—carving the spiral with visible cost—meet 9+ criteria; minor deduction for "fiercely meditative" bordering on label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("ghost began to fade," families weeping unknowingly); accumulative lens holds perfectly through spiral pattern reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices (loam for mapping, glass for dye transfer) and charges the final image (seedlings breaking tile); avocado tree’s calcium-drinking roots directly enable the sap release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency (retracing steps reveals sorrows) with felt cost (ghost’s fading); "before last butterflies leave" creates live urgency that shapes every tactic under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete actions (ribbon spiral, carving shallow groove); final butterfly constellation image reweights grief as living pattern without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thundering calm," "calcium of the forgotten") modulates rhythm under pressure; patterned elision (frost summons) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("scent of lilies cut too soon" compresses funeral history); figurative precision in peak beats ("glass panes rattling like loosened teeth") fuels propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief as widening gyre (not circle) synthesizes tropes through specific, verifiable details (avocado roots, monarch-wing dye); emotional specificity avoids abstraction while risking lyric structure.</comment>
