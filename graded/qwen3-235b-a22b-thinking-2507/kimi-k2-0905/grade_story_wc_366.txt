<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s silent ritual—duty vs despair embodied in stone-stacking micro-choices. Keeper’s absence creates palpable tension, though her off-page presence limits secondary pressure. Final cairn for the widow’s cove cements earned endurance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sea glass’s "green warmth" reconfigures witnessed absence into tangible safety with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the lamp’s coughing death tightens stakes without causal turns. No orientation debt; pattern taught early via stone stacks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lantern room as micro-setting constrains every choice (stones on rail, glass near lens). Sea glass evolution—from object to bottled safety—charges the final image. Minor deduction: "salt-ghost" metaphor edges toward ornamental despite strong integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around preserving connection against forgetting; lamp’s double death escalates pressure under Accumulative lens. Elias’s agency shines in stacking the fourth stone and bottling glass—tactics narrowing to ritual endurance. Cost is felt in widow’s cove stone and keeper’s potential fall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through objects: sea glass as "safety trying to fit inside metal" reweights absence without moralizing. Final image answers "protection from forgetting" via physical warmth, avoiding sentimentality. No abstraction—purely earned through stone stacks and bottled light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "warmly observant eyes read the tower’s mute Morse" reveals Elias’s trade-specific noticing. Rhythm modulates from sighing wind to creaking boots under stress. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in tactile, character-particular detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolding; every line propels atmosphere or character. "Glass lenses hung like frozen tears" serves Accumulative pressure without muddle. Final line’s "green warmth travel through his glove to the bone" achieves perfect resonance—no figurative clutter in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via stone-stack language—specific, non-obvious ritual born from "widow’s cove" trauma. Emotional specificity in "bottling safety" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (silent connection) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
