<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "genuinely artificial" epiphany, but single-character limits relationship dynamics; micro-choices like dissolving the stencil into origami reveal values with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the final origami coordinate mapping her departure crystallizes cost ("carrying loss as material") under Accumulative lens; pattern taught early pays off in curtain glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: mechanical orreries and glass plates constrain origami placements, charging the final constellation; "water from curtains" dissolving stencil proves environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully around "preservation vs celebration," but rock-bottom backstory lacks live-clock pressure; cost is felt ("grief transforms us into something new") yet agency in escalation feels passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing through concrete particulars (origami coordinates as "laughter echoing"), but final paragraph's "teach the dead to bloom again" triggers thematic echo penalty; subtext in "genuinely artificial" jewelry rescues resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in jewelry-maker's tactile focus ("precise folds," "weight of her hand"); rhythmic control under pressure as candlelight dissolves vellum avoids lyric overindulgence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat, but "curtains of intention fluttered against the glass dome" risks overwriting density; no artifacts dull the origami-constellation payoff, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mourning tropes via "genuinely artificial" synthesis—memorials as transformed love, not frozen relics; specificity of astronomical clocks folding hair-weaving craft avoids abstraction.</comment>
