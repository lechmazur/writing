<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "transformed into something new, not better, but different," but "teaching the dead to bloom" edges toward diagnostic label-speak during peak emotional beats, slightly undermining embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: her departure crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("carrying loss not as a burden but as the material"). Accumulative lens holds through origami placements reweighting grief, with curtain-glow payoff making cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting actively constrains choices: telescope eyepiece placement, curtain-water dissolving the stencil. The vellum's transformation via intention-curtains directly charges the final image, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: each origami placement deepens her realization about grief's transformation. Cost is unmistakable in "not better, but different," narrowing options to acceptance. Single tightening suffices perfectly for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (dissolving stencil into origami), avoiding moralizing. Near-miss: "withering was not an ending" slightly over-explains where image alone would resonate, but final "genuinely artificial and truly alive" reweights prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("fingers tracing the edge," "subdued ardor in precise folds"), but "teaching the dead to bloom" repetition in final paragraphs risks thematic echo, slightly diluting rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with no closure-dulling artifacts. Minor deduction: "genuinely artificial" appears three times with slight redundancy in the third instance, though still within momentum tolerance for this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms mourning tropes through specific mechanics: soul-tracking observatory, coordinates as memory portals. "Curtains of intention woven from unfinished dreams" feels fresh without gimmickry, synthesizing grief's texture into inevitable narrative logic.</comment>
