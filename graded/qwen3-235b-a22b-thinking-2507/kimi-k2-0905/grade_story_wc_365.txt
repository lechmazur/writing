<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs complicity) manifest physically in shard-guided movements; final renunciation of weaponized mapping earned through visceral data-cube swallowing and "copper wire of veins" cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "her sensory gifts weaponized while she slept" crystallizes complicity; Accumulative lens holds through "filaments of itself in her nerves" density build to final "question she is finally ready to answer."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Repair bay’s "broken ribs" and shard constrain every choice; micro-setting (glass humming against void) charges final image as she pockets it while "mapping the tremor in her wrist," fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening knowledge (crater bay → zero-g locker) narrows options to single path of revelation; cost unmistakable in "maps sold to militaries funded the cover-up" with tactical shift to redirect commissions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard’s physical "weight of withheld truth" and data-cube swallowing; final "language of vibration and light" reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ quick test perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("dust tasting of rust," "shard hums") creates unmatched rhythmic control; "cyclically spontaneous" refrain modulates under pressure while avoiding head-hopping in multi-bay observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "soles recording temperature, vibration, and precise ache of longing" achieves triple-duty density; final "broken ribs settling into the shape of a question" avoids figurative muddle while recharging opening motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping with multiverse theory—truth as measurable mass ("copper wire of veins")—avoids cliché; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
