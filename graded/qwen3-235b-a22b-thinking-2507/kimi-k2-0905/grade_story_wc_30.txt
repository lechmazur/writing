<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "designation tilt" and embodied action (smelting identities while boots hiss); micro-choice of cranking wrist to extend net reveals hierarchy of values with cost in hollow ribcage shaped like tomorrow's absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: guarding "still point where every story agrees to be unfinished" crystallizes options with conceptual cost in "wintersun serenity" painting water "gold without warmth"—memory kept for its own sake as tide returns under another name.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains every choice (submerged stairs, copper boots hissing); bamboo creel evolves from heart-container to root-anchoring the archive, charging final image where its "soft crack" makes room for future contradictions while shelves bleed ink into swimming stories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens: moon's pull narrows options as "call-numbers slide off pages," forcing librarian to smelt identities before contradictions scatter into "storms of forgetting," with visible cost in the hollow where tomorrow existed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "wonder survives only in motion" without moralizing; final non-literal answer reweights premise via creel's expansion—"I will routine you into stars, but never cage your orbit"—as identities migrate into unnamed fish under a sky "that had forgotten to end."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature gleams in brass/bamboo/saltwater lexicon ("gears clicked," "fibers showed moving pictures"); rhythmic control peaks during smelting as identities "fluttered against filament like silver leaves," with no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt settled on brass like frost that had never heard of cold" does triple duty (sensory, thematic, closure charge) without muddle; strategic telling compresses backstory via creel's "litany written when still entirely one person."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "titan-gear librarian" transforms archive tropes through tangible mechanics (rib-cage heart, filament net); "migrating identities" gains freshness via smelting process where contradictions "soften like wax stamped with a seal nobody remembered," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
