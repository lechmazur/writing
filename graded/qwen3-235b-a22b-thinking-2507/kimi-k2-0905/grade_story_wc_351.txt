<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "chaotically precise" calibration—each wrench twitch is both error/correction—yet final pocket sketches emerge without memory, earning ambiguous endurance with blood-cost. No stock phrasing; embodied emotion via "turbines bud in marrow," avoiding diagnostic labels even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure tightens through sensory density until moon’s slide triggers collapse. Closure lands as Charged Poise—pocket sketches prove transformed failure, quartz seams promise renewal—with visceral cost (blood, clattering engines). Orientation clear by line 3; lens inferred by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon actively constrains choices: mirror angle must counter canyon geometry, moon’s movement dictates timer. Final image of "quartz seams ready for next dreamer" charges closure while evolving setting causally. Body/tool integration flawless—blood from hairline, gloves magnetizing shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (extract dreams intact) tightens via protagonist agency: her calibration forecloses safety, trading motor control for resonance. Cost is tripartite—physical (blood), emotional (fading voices), tactical (engines to dust)—made unmistakable when "mirrors burned out" yet pockets sag with moonlight gears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "archaeology of light" crystallizes in pocket sketches of basalt wings, rejecting tidy morals. Final image reweights failure as iterative progress—"transformation never ceased"—without stating thesis. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "quaking reverie" smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is engineer-poet: "synaptic plasticity gone feral," "lunar silver like broken periscope mirror." Rhythm accelerates under stress ("Cold fire crawled... mirror flared") then fractures ("Engines mid-birth clattered to dust"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("gloved hand and the canyon answered"). Figurative language serves pressure: "spilled mercury seeking old shape" during climax. Only marginal register drift—"synthetic neurotrophin" slightly clinical but justified by POV. Closure image razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes: "entangled memories as coolant" drives canyon physics, not backdrop. Emotional truth in "chaotically precise hunger" overcomes conceptual risk. Final synthesis—"mirrors unbroken or eyes needing none"—feels inevitable. Avoids safety middle via bold, coherent premise execution.</comment>
