<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lark’s molting ritual embodies contradictory impulses—shedding cynicism while fearing the new skin’s fragility—and his pivot to strategic performance ("inventoried the contraband") during Rourke’s intrusion earns the lantern-bearer shift through visible cost in the ashes. Marin’s pragmatic idealism ("photograph well for audit") contrasts Lark’s lyricism without flattening her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rourke’s retreat crystallizes fragile victory without resolving tension, reweighting the library as "sovereign gap" with conceptual cost in the glowing ashes of discarded selves. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rebuilt shelves and paper cranes accumulate toward the resonant final image of "beauty clawed from anarchy," charged by the moon’s silver rinse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library’s warped shelves become the spiral nest, the stove’s green flames transform identity husks into resistance fuel, and hollowed dictionaries birth paper wings—each micro-setting constrains choices (hiding skins in coffee tin) and charges the closure. "Luminous fracture" against iron exemplifies sensory specificity mirroring internal rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens when Rourke’s footsteps force Lark/Marin to stand holding the coffee tin as chalice, narrowing options to collective performance. The riot backstory isn’t mere reflection—it motivates "Rebuild" as direct response, with cost legible in the "trembling" new skin and recycled selves feeding the stove’s green flames.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through cranes in dictionaries and ashes as compost—no final moralizing. "Resistance needs hideouts" and "blooming needs compost" are character-earned, while the final image ("patrons stream out carrying paper wings") reweights "beauty from anarchy" as clawed, embodied truth without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lark’s lyrical compression ("tasting the bones, not the marrow") versus Marin’s pragmatic cadence ("Warden wants programs that photograph well") stays distinct under pressure. Prose rhythm varies from fragmented urgency ("Skin splits") to flowing collaboration ("voices braid, echo upward"), with "winged, collaborative" shadows showcasing controlled density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous fracture" avoids purple prose by tethering metaphor to iron physics. Sentences vary from staccato ("No time to flee") to lyrical flow, with "desert will remember how beauty clawed itself from anarchy" achieving crystalline closure without sentimentality. Only microscopic flaw: "sirens wail distant" slightly tells.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Molting as monthly reinvention transforms prison tropes—identity isn’t fixed but composted (husks feed resistance). Coffee tin’s false bottom isn’t gimmick but necessity for deception, while "paper wings" gain freshness through hollowed dictionaries. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no antagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
