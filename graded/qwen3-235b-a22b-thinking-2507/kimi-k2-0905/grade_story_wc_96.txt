<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s molting ritual embodies contradictory impulses (reinvention vs. entropy) through concrete actions like stuffing husks into the coffee tin; Marin’s quiet rebellion feels earned via prior book-sorting intimacy, though her backstory lacks the same visceral texture as Lark’s skin-splitting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the "thicker, sweeter silence" after Rourke’s retreat crystallizes their fragile sovereignty, with the cooling ashes and new skin settling reconfiguring the stakes under an accumulative lens focused on textual density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library actively constrains choices—hiding husks in coffee tins, rebuilding warped shelves into a spiral—culminating in the moon-rinsed beams and rustling paper cranes charging the final image with luminous specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lark’s agency: rebuilding shelves directly counters the bulldozer threat, with the Sergeant confrontation narrowing options through quick-witted dialogue; cost is legible in the "impossible order" that risks exposure yet preserves hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action—"beauty from anarchy" shifts from graffiti mantra to lived practice via burning skins and paper cranes—avoiding moralizing; the final image of "beauty clawed itself from anarchy" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice distinction shines in Lark’s poetic compression ("tasting the bones, not the marrow") versus Marin’s pragmatic prison lexicon; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("flames bloom green, luminous fracture"), with no head-hopping despite dual perspectives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "skin splits at the shoulder blades" and "words arrive jagged" exemplify high-density propulsion. Final line’s "word by word" cadence recharges the moon motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Monthly molting transforms a trope into visceral stakes via coffee-tin composting; the prison-library setting’s specificity ("water-warped Neruda," "intake forms as cranes") forges an inevitable synthesis where beauty actively claws from anarchy.</comment>
