<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (cold creeping to bone) and embodied emotion; final choice to tear illustration earned by "vows rot like fruit" micro-arc. Slight abstraction in "border dispute" heartbeat metaphor limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("relinquishment" as final ingredient); Accumulative lens holds through pattern-building. Orientation flawless within 120 words; no causality breaks in pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Subarctic crater actively constrains choices (catching starlight); illustration plate evolves from memory trigger to map component. Body (frozen eyelashes) and tool (flash-paper) charge final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (completing map) tightens through starlight depletion and moon's passage; relinquishment trade-off crystallizes with visible cost. Agency in pattern-making and tearing illustration; pressure peaks when doubt "crystallizes in veins".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: starlight as distilled photons, heartbeats as roads. Final torn illustration reweights "vows rot like fruit" without moralizing; map's ragged coastline embodies irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rime furred eyelashes into lace", "moon spilled no coin of light"); syntax compresses under stress ("one heartbeat, two, three"). Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "tear loosed from galaxy's eye" metaphor coherent under pressure. Final "tore the storybook" line crystallizes cost with surgical precision; zero figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/cartography/grief; "flash-paper burning without ash" transforms tropes. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes; every detail serves premise (blackened trees as "burnt matches").</comment>
