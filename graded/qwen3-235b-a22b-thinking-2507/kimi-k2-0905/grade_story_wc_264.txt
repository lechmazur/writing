<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("fractured lullaby" as charm), embodied emotion ("small warm hands that tugged his coat"), but "dreamless" flaw lacks active complication; micro-choices under pressure feel earned yet motivation remains abstractly ritualistic without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: clock split creates crystallized moment where "unlit corner" embodies cost of divergent time. Orientation clear by 120 words ("forest burned three nights ago"), Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to final cost: "cargo once deemed lost now travels by wave."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting object (chess clock) constrains choice and charges closure: buried "face down" to split time. Poppies evolve from visual detail to "paper lanterns" charging final image; environment actively pressures guard's kneeling and planting decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving children's dreams) signaled early; escalation via density increase as "probability clouds condense" into tangible hands. Cost is conceptual (forest/time irrecoverable) but felt in "unlit corner" where futures crouch—visible through cargo's wave-travel pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lullaby sparks charging pollen children, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("lullaby kept traveling... what sings never truly ends") reweights premise with conceptual cost: songs persist without singers, embracing loss without false hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("poppies flickering like defective film frames") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from sparse ("pressed palm to chess clock") to lyrical ("breathing the sparks in") without head-hopping; quantum lexicon fits guard's occupation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "divergent archive of all the hours that would never come again" (redundant with prior line), but zero loops. High density ("silver scars disappearing into starlight") propels momentum; "screaming mouth" metaphor slightly strains logic yet serves tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: freight guard + quantum lullabies transforms tropes. "Wave-function charm" feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (time as physical substance) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity ("phosphorescent poppies") anchors universals.</comment>
