<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("compass hand spinning free, sextant eye weeping mercury"), but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous manifestation in pivotal moments; final renunciation is earned though micro-choices like soldering hair reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: "she understood she was not the navigator but the offering" crystallizes stance with felt cost as seams loosen; Accumulative lens holds through phone call escalations tightening options toward dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Starlit signal station functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (hydraulic failure dictates timeframe, dish tilt enables ritual); censer foot's physical properties directly charge closure when it "crumbles to green dust," making environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via cryptic phone calls drives protagonist agency ("she obeyed, burning fingertips"), narrowing options until dissolution; cost is unmistakable as "weight left her" during the offering, with moon-phase mechanics creating visible tradeoffs in timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("reverse migration is not travel but translation"), avoiding moralizing; final image of "raw solace for whoever arrived" reweights "geography of loss" into resonant non-literal answer without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("patina bronze censer foot rubbing into her thigh like a bruise shaped like home"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful elision (phone call instructions) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moonlight moved it, a fraction each night, the way sorrow shifts" exemplifies multi-jobbing lines with propulsion; figurative language ("hydraulics die beneath her skin like a final heartbeat") remains clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes through censer foot mechanics and reverse migration physics; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming "geography of loss" into literal embodied landscape.</comment>
