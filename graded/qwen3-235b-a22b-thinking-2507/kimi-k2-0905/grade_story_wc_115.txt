<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Jules' corroded faith versus embodied recklessness; the valve-wheel appraisal reveals hierarchy of values through micro-choices. Final bead-weighing earns endurance with visible cost: palms tattooed with burns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Jules' transfer of 1,887 lbs truth into his chest ("emptied and ballasted") crystallizes irreversible cost. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through rhythmic bead clicks until the massless wheel sinks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The valve wheel constrains every choice and charges the final image—burns on palms, beads clicking in ribs. Tunnel's "coal dust communion wafers" and coolant mist ingested as "body of industry" make setting a visceral, thematic constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Jules' agency: decoding radio calls tightens options until the bead-weighing forces irreversible trade-off. Cost is legible in the transferred weight, though the "1,887 lbs" feels slightly abstract despite physical burns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ingested coolant mist as "swallowed truth," beads as measurable guilt. Final image reweights industrial faith without moralizing—"ballasted" reckoning in the chest offers non-literal answer to "weight of truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Jules' sensory decay ("drowsy alertness," shadows elongating). Rhythmic control peaks in the radio delay scene; compression taught early pays off in the heartbeat rhythm of static. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "brass, cold, its rosary-like beads worn smooth" achieves high density. One minor register drift: "residual magnetism" slightly over-academic but redeemed by context. Closure beat ("diesel-pink light") remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-shift trope via industrial sacramentals (valve as rosary, coolant as communion). Risk-taking elevates stakes: truth as measurable weight (1,887 lbs) synthesizes moral and physical burden without gimmickry.</comment>
