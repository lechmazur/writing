<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied choices (dancing gaps, skin verses) avoids abstraction; micro-decisions under dawn pressure reveal hierarchy of values. Slight risk of "obsidian grace" as label, but redeemed by physical cost of moonstone sacrifice in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: moonstone dust's final grain burning to form the period. Accumulative lens holds—density of gaps observed crystallizes into irreversible transformation. "Skin ends, verse orbits" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting: dew anchors footprints, stars supply constellations for skin verses. Body-as-setting charges closure—collarbones become "constellation bruised," footprints spiral into absence. Final rearranged stars prove environment constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: dawn deadline forces accelerated dancing to seal verses. Cost is visceral—moonstone depletion and irreversible skin transformation. Pressure grows via lyrical density ("dancing the gaps") rather than reversals, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through skin verses: "Remember the sea that forgot you" embodies forbidden memory without moralizing. Final image (footprints into absence, rearranged stars) offers resonant answer to nostalgia ban's erasure, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "air tasted of obsidian grace" filters setting through dancer's embodied cognition. Rhythmic control under pressure—cadence shifts from spiraling luminescence to staccato "halted, chest heaving." No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels (e.g., "dust lifted, orbiting wrists like obedient minnows" merges action/image). Figurative language serves pressure—"crickets feared to punctuate her" deepens silence. Final line recharges "horizon" motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "memory ban" trope through skin-as-canvas specificity. Emotional truth in exile's cost outweighs surface novelty. Fresh inflection: "fledging" as linguistic rebirth, not flight. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
