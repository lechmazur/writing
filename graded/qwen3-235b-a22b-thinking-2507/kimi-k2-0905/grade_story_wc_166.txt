<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("hips forecasting surf that no longer officially existed") and micro-choices like subtracting herself until "only tide remained." Final transformation earned by moonstone sacrifice, though "cosmic verse" motivation borders slightly on abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative/Textural closure as Charged Poise: "she had become the forbidden memory" crystallizes stakes with visceral cost in the moonstone's last grain burning. Orientation perfect ("twilight garden under stars" by word 15), lens held through final rearranged stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as active constraint—its "hush" teaches memory-hiding, dry fountain shapes her spirals. Moonstone dust as micro-setting charges closure ("Skin ends, verse orbits, stars read"), though "obsidian grace" repetition slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through embodied escalation: each verse inscription narrows options as moonstone depletes, culminating in sacrificial period. Protagonist agency drives every deepening ("danced the gaps," "spoke to them in undertow"), cost unmistakable in dimming dust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through skin-versus-censorship ("constellation bruised into collarbones"), resolved in non-literal final line reweighting exile. Avoids moralizing, though "darker, kinder firmament" edges toward abstraction without concrete anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("feet sinking into moss still warm from the day’s last sigh") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity. Only minor register drift in "spontaneously anchored" slightly jars dancer’s embodied lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-perfect density: "air tasted of obsidian grace, smooth and cutting" does triple duty. One paraphrase loop ("chewed at her ankles each dawn until she returned... where memory’s scent lingered") costs 0.2 points, but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through skin-as-canvas specificity; moonstone’s evolution from throat shimmer to sacrificial ink feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure without dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though nostalgia ban premise borders on familiar.</comment>
