<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; Ambrose's choices driven by duty rather than conflicting desires. The micro-choice to immerse the shaving reveals his archival instinct, yet his acceptance of the prophecy feels passive rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Ambrose's endurance as the foghorn's vessel carries conceptual cost ("the orchard would be gone—transmuted into soft velvet disquiet"). Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but the shaving's dissolution feels slightly convenient, missing full causal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard garden constrains every choice (e.g., basin for immersion, quince ink) and charges the final image. Sensory details like "greasy rainbow on the water" and "velvet disquiet" evolve with pressure, avoiding symbolism while mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ambrose's agency: his decision to archive the prophecy forces renunciation of silence, narrowing options to becoming the city's living archive. Cost is palpable in the orchard's transmutation, though escalation leans slightly heavy on lyrical accumulation over causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "to remain" as both burden and duty, reweighted by the final image of Ambrose waiting with "voice neither alive nor dead." Avoids moralizing while offering resonant answer to promise-breaking grief through the ledger's braille transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in lexicon ("oath scribe," "xylem lullaby") and rhythm, compressing time via sensory triggers. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstractions near closure, but voice modulates perfectly under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "palms open, waiting for the city’s grief to rise" blends action and stakes. Minor overwriting in "trembling waveform that spoke in Hittite" risks muddling, but density serves Accumulative lens without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality in transforming archival duty into bodily prophecy; "velvet disquiet" reconfigures urban grief through sensory specificity. Risk-taking (Hittite prophecy via wax shaving) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight through the mother's Etruscan lullaby groundwork.</comment>
