<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scraps' retirement from finding bodies creates potent irony; her micro-choice pressing the leaf against the cylinder earns closure with embodied cost. Kite’s burnt-orange eyes mirroring the leaf show concrete particularity without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the softened leaf and orchard-smoke wind reweight war/peace with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation, though archive-to-journey transition lacks causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wax-sealed leaf constrains every key choice—from riddle solution to brother’s coordinates—and charges the final image. Desert mallow blooming on tanks shows lived-in setting evolution with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Scraps’ scent-to-syntax translation; the cost of "iron oxide at 300 paces" layering memory into coordinates is visceral. Agency-driven deepening narrows options via the leaf’s physical properties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leaf’s "tinted revelations" reprise: the final orchard-smoke wind answers "distance into closeness" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in sensory transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ozone" for static pops and "sweet rot of distant apple trees" for pitch. Voice modulates from lyrical ("wild hush") to urgent ("barked once, low") without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "copper glow" and "spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s "only distance worth traveling" avoids sentimentality through concrete orchard smoke.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger tropes via bloodhound POV: scent-as-syntax decoding feels inevitable. Risk-taking (phonograph grooves as scent maps) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by wax-leaf physics.</comment>
