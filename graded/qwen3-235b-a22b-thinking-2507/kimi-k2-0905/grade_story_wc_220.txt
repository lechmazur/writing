<question>1</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Scraps’ motivation (“translate distance into closeness”) manifests through embodied micro-choices like nudging the leaf toward moonlight, avoiding label-speak; her identity shift from body-finder to “courier teaching distance how to kneel” earns closure with visceral cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the orchard-smoke wind reweights the entire journey’s cost, with Scraps’ transformation (“no longer retired... but a courier”) legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors within 10 words via “bloodhound limped between towers of rusted drones.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The wax leaf functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (triggering Scraps’ solution) and charges the final image—softening wax emitting orchard smoke reconfigures the wasteland’s meaning, fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging closure through a recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Scraps’ agency: her scent-to-syntax translation directly solves the riddle, narrowing options to the brother’s coordinates; the cost—her identity shift—is visible in “limping slightly ahead” while the leaf’s warmth against Kite’s skin embodies earned closeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the leaf’s evolution: from “crimson veins appearing black” to sunrise-colored orchard smoke, the final line reweights “distance worth traveling” without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test via resonant image over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in pressure—static “smelled of ozone,” pitch carried “sweet rot of apple trees”—with rhythmic control (“wind afraid of its strength”) and zero head-hopping; voice modulates from Scraps’ sensory focus to collective “they” during the search.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels meaning: “moonlight slid through translucent wax so tinted revelations spilled like spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise” merges action, setting, and theme without figurative muddle, clearing the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms post-war tropes through specific sensory logic—the bloodhound’s scent-to-syntax translation and phonograph’s “secret texts” feel inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking (olfactory riddle solution) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
