<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details ("tasting iron," "green turning to ash"); contradictory impulses (seeking betrayal while complicit in doubt) drive the forge climax where cost—her own complicity—is viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from aurora-bleeding opening to Charged Poise closure; the forge sequence tightens pressure through sensory density, with cost legible in "her own complicity" realization that alters her future approach to trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks isn't backdrop but constraint: roots in lifeboat hulls leach memory, forcing Mara's realization that the orchard "grew by drinking stories," directly charging the final image where brother's laugh "teaches trees how to hold both wound and blossom."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes narrow from hunting betrayal's sound to confronting her complicity; Mara's agency in pressing her ear to the forge (driven by Accumulative escalation) yields the visible cost of self-revelation, reweighting trust as a "fragile hush" to be heard rather than fixed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "collecting absences" shifts from preserving loss to admitting "hollow space inside every future connection," culminating in the resonant final image where brother's laugh teaches trees to "hold both wound and blossom," avoiding moralizing while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("auroras bled," forge as "slow cello") filters all observation through Mara's scientific/artistic lens; compression ("cells divide in cambium layers") is taught early and pays off in the orchard's biological metaphor, with no head-hopping in this single-POV design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "forge exhaled a sound like glass cracking under weight of snow" achieves high density without muddle, while "hemorrhaging russet" sharpens sensory specificity. Tense shift in "cambium split and cells divide" is a hairline slip preventing 9.7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "hearing loss" trope through "hearing colors" and "collecting absences," with sunken orchard greenhouse synthesizing grief into ecological metaphor; emotional specificity ("green turning to ash") avoids sentimentality while the "battered marvel" tone deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
