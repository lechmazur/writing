<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia manifests concretely in her perception (waves "move" under exhaustion) and drives micro-choices like mixing rainwater pigments. Final endurance—accepting insomnia as vigilance—earns closure through prior causality, with visible cost in her first deep sleep in months.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Mara's endurance of insomnia's purpose forecloses artistic failure with undeniable cost ("for the first time in months, Mara slept deeply"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward this crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rain trails function as micro-setting that constrains movement and becomes pigment, charging the final image where droplets carry "microscopic life" for the new world. Tidal rhythms actively pressure choices (receding tide reveals monastery, guides her path).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency as shell spirals and pottery shard accumulate evidence of cyclical history, narrowing her options until the realization that insomnia is "necessary vigilance." Cost is visceral in her exhaustion transforming to sleep after months.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete particulars: amber brooch (prehistoric insects) and pottery shard (mountaintop boats) culminate in dreams of ancient spirals. Final image reweights water wars as cyclical revelation without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "rain trails ribboned down basalt" and "frescoes bubbled and peeled" filter setting through Mara's exhaustion. Dialogue shows voice distinction—woman's imperative "Paint what the water revealed" versus Mara's initial self-doubt—without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rain trails" recurs with escalating function (guide feet → pigment → new world carrier). Final line’s "spirals that existed long before her species learned to fear the water" crystallizes Accumulative lens with razor-sharp density and no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as necessary vigilance for witnessing "unearthed convergence" transforms water-war tropes. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—tidal rhythms and artistic process feel inevitable, not gimmicky, with closure intact.</comment>
