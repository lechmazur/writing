<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (insomnia as curse/gift), embodied emotions ("raw from three days"), and micro-choices (kneeling at shells) reveal value hierarchy. Secondary character lacks depth but applies pressure via pottery shard exchange. No diagnostic label-speak; final choice earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by word 30 ("causeway," "tidal island"). Earned Stasis closure lands cleanly: Mara's sleep after trading insomnia-for-vigilance carries conceptual cost (pure water vial). Accumulative escalation via sensory density (rain trails → shell spirals → feverish painting) reweights meaning under coherent lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal island pressures choices (monastery emerges only at low tide), while brooch and pottery shard function as micro-settings constraining tactics. Sensory details selective and purposeful ("rain trails ribboned down basalt stones"); final image charged by brooch's warmth and vial's purity. Environment shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("thresh meaning") escalates through sensory accumulation: shell spirals deepen understanding, pottery shard forces exchange, painting completes the transformation. Mara's agency drives each turn under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable—trading insomnia for meaning via the pure water vial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (amber brooch, shell spirals), not abstraction. Final image reweights "unearthed convergence" as islands existing "in multiple times simultaneously"—a resonant, non-literal answer avoiding moralizing. Woman's "meaning we've threshed" earns resonance through action, not thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rain trails ribboned down basalt stones") and rhythmic control under pressure ("each droplet carrying fragments of water wars' aftermath"). Stable POV with lyrical compression taught early. Dialogue natural and subtextual ("Paint what the water revealed"), lexicon consistently artist-focused without academic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("amber brooch holding prehistoric insects that drank from primordial seas now poisoned"). Final line crystallizes closure without muddle: "dreams filled with spirals" recharges the brooch's significance. Opening anchors voice/stakes, prose propulsion matches tidal rhythm—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: water wars backdrop transforms art into meaning-making, not disaster tropes. Specifics matter (pottery depicting drowned mountaintops); swap "tidal island" for generic ruins and emotional arc collapses. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
