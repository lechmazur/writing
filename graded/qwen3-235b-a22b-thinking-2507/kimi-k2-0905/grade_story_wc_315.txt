<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—distrust versus recognition of her future self—drive the pivotal choice to pass the buckle. Embodied emotion ("pulse drummed like a soundless echo") avoids therapy-speak while showing flaw-driven struggle. The earned renunciation of perpetual vigilance carries visible cost in "lighter by one buckle but heavier by one choice," though minor abstraction in "preservation of trust" slightly dilutes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: releasing the burden reconfigures the vigil's meaning without tidy resolution. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density ("pale cloud that drifted toward the stars") tightening pressure toward the buckle's transfer. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3, with cost legible in the final tally marks for "releases"—no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (coaxing past false catch) and charging the closure when clipped to the older self's harness. Sensory hierarchy—filtered through the seeker's trained attention—narrows to tactile metal clicks under stress, avoiding white-room syndrome. Recurring "soundless echo" evolves from dread to peace, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency as the stolen signal forces revision of trust, narrowing options to "drop it as a false clue" or descend. The dominant stake (trust vs. security) tightens through the instructor's impossible signal, with cost unmistakable in the physical/emotional weight shift of passing the buckle. No coincidence resolves tension; pressure coheres via Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: tally marks shifting from sightings to "releases" reweight the central question without moralizing. The final image—etching new marks while the canopy "stirred, accepting her revised oath"—offers non-literal resolution to trust's burden. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lingers in "letting the pattern continue without the watcher" as earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "muscle memory" details (buckle's tongue, penlight cadence) and rhythmic control during tension ("flicked her own penlight once—an unanswered question"). Voice modulates from taut precision to lyrical release without head-hopping. Compression ("three years attentively inventive") is taught early and pays off in closure’s earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "soundless echo" recurrence avoids synonym churn by deepening meaning. Slight density in "attentively inventive" borders on abstraction but gains texture through cataloging silhouettes. Final image ("peace across the nocturnal arbor") avoids purple prose, though one elevated phrase ("attentively inventive") risks register drift under peak stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-fold and trust mechanics feels inevitable: the older self as both threat and resolution transforms vigilance tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes via lyric compression (radio static as live clock), while specific details ("scratches etched to count successful watches") anchor universals. Avoids derivative premises through emotional specificity in the buckle's transfer.</comment>
