<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (trust vs. vigilance) drives the buckle-passing climax; embodied cost in "lighter by one buckle but heavier by one choice" avoids label-speak; micro-choices like the descent reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "heavier by one choice" crystallizes the cost of releasing vigilance; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern recognition; orientation clear by 40 words with "nocturnal arbor" and "parachute buckle."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (false catch mechanics) and charges the final image; sensory hierarchy reflects urgency ("pulse drummed like a soundless echo" during crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: spotting the stolen signal forces the descent decision; cost is unmistakable in the physical/emotional weight shift at "lighter by one buckle but heavier by one choice."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: etching "releases" not sightings reweights vigilance without moralizing; final image offers resonant answer to "who do you let land" through the buckle's transfer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "muscle memory" focus; rhythmic control under pressure ("two short, one long" cadence); elision of instructor's death taught early and paid off in the signal exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soundless echo" metaphor gains density through reprise; final line's "peace across the nocturnal arbor" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: transforms surveillance tropes through embodied detail ("attentively inventive" as muscle memory); time-fold risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
