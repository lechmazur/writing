<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "awkwardly confident" label lacks embodied struggle despite micro-choices. Final renunciation (staying to reignite) earns cost but internal conflict feels summarized rather than layered in peak beats like the stone circle communion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "planet fall away beneath her—not abandonment, but a promise" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (leaving home) under Hybrid lens. Orientation clear by line 3; stone circle’s hum drives escalation without causality breaks despite mystical elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ferrocrete dust and opera glasses constrain choices—soles tasting dust enables stone circle contact, cracked lens splits sunlight for ignition. "Swallows as ships" avoids overt symbolism by charging the launch climax. Micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when rebellion’s "lull" reconfigures from stalemate to "gathering of breath," narrowing options to reignition. Cost is legible in "confidence welded to bone" and abandoned home, but escalation leans slightly on stone circle’s mystical intervention over pure protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (lullaby woven into stone hum), but "discover meaning in the mess" restatement in final paragraph triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty. Final image ("trailing song instead of fire") reweights rebellion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soles tasting the dust," "dumb metal flowers") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early ("cathedral of thunderous serenity") pays off in closure. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "peppercorns flung into blue soup" shows textural specificity. Paraphrase loop penalty (-0.2) for "thunderous serenity" repetition in paragraphs 1 and 7 dulls closure image slightly. Propulsion flawless through final thruster punch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms spaceport decay into emotional specificity—rust isn’t generic but "dumb metal flowers." Fresh synthesis: rebellion’s pause as "held breath" reweights stasis as active preparation. Risk-taking (stone circle sentience) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
