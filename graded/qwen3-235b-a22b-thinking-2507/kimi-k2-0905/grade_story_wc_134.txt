<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks clarity on clairvoyant's internal conflict about her foresight limitation; pilgrim's change is earned but her motivation remains opaque despite visible cost of erosion into mineral song.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words ("musical crystal cave" anchor delayed) triggers -0.4; closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with cost ("voice eroding into mineral song") but lens ambiguity weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cave functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (branching corridors, memory-inhabiting walls) and charges final image with "bright darkness expanding"; luminous scar directly shapes pilgrim's post-cave perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pilgrim's surrender of observation/participation boundary; cost is unmistakable in clairvoyant's vision fracturing and eroded voice, though "unseen forces" concept lacks concrete tactical impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing while final image ("magic is not rare—only quiet") reweights theme through concrete particulars; "hopscotch grids into galaxies" embodies earned resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("limestone scrape," "chime like a question") with rhythmic control, but "steadily unpredictable" phrase repeats as tic, slightly dulling pressure in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, but synonym churn on "luminous" (water/scar/corridors) and template cadence in corridor descriptions ("branching like frozen lightning") trigger -0.3 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms crystal cave trope via musical mechanics and everyday magic focus; risk in Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds, but "cave pearl" feels derivative despite strong integration.</comment>
