<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elian's rejection of "packaged radiance" versus craving "one unprogrammed moment," embodied through the marigold's warmth healing frost scars "without drama." Micro-choice of unstrapping bands earns his renunciation, but emotional progression lacks deeper layering—tears refracting halos feel slightly abstract rather than viscerally contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the fractured keystone scattering "prefab light into something unplanned" reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (end of algorithmic control). Accumulative lens holds through "brilliant dimness" pattern, with the petal's independent glow proving cost. Orientation anchors spire/curfew by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire’s "crystal lamps exhal[ing] brilliant dimness" constrains every choice—Elian’s frostbitten knuckles, the impossible marigold thriving only through keystone light. Final image of "orange flame that accommodated impossibilities" charges closure by reweighting the spire’s core aesthetic as active resistance, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (sacred simplicity vs. algorithmic control) tighten meaningfully when the keystone’s "doorway" appears—Elian’s unstrapping bands narrows options to a binary choice. Cost is visible in the keystone’s "hairline fracture," but escalation leans atmospheric; the High Algorithm’s clicking feels observational rather than pressuring his decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the marigold’s "stubborn" seed rejecting algorithmic logic becomes the resonant answer to "where is the sacred?" Final petal delivery to "Whoever Still Looks Up" avoids moralizing while charging prior material—no abstraction, only the envelope’s "soft thump" echoing Elian’s earned shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("algorithmic auroras stitch the sky with prefab wonder") filters all description through Elian’s disillusioned lens. Rhythmic control peaks in the mist-walking sequence—"cool but not cold, across a narrow bridge of condensed moonlight"—where compression serves pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with high density ("frost scars on his knuckles healed without drama, like mistakes quietly forgiven"). Slight register drift in "lingering luminance" (academic phrasing amid poetic voice) prevents 9.0+, but final line’s "orange flame that accommodated impossibilities" delivers crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms automation tropes through "brilliant dimness"—a fresh, non-obvious lens where cold light becomes sacred when uncontrolled. Risk-taking (algorithmic miracles scheduled by drone) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the marigold’s stubborn warmth feels inevitable yet revelatory in hindsight.</comment>
