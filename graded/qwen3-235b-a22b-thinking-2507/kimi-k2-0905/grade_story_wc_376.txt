<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s wilting near dishonesty manifests physically and drives micro-choices (admitting fear of echo-listening), with contradictory impulses (seeking truth vs. self-protection) culminating in earned realization. Absence of secondary characters limits relationship testing but fits single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: tears strengthening ink reconfigures candor’s cost with undeniable emotional weight ("candor fed on exposed feeling"). Accumulative lens holds through junction tests, though "tomorrow’s date" edges toward convenience without undermining cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively pressures choices (steaming corridors, lily-shaped slot), but micro-setting (zinc plate) falls short of 9+ gate—final image relies on letters’ humidity response, not an object constraining choice. "Rust and wilted orchids" exemplifies sensory economy anchoring stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. performative speech) tighten through Lira’s vulnerable admissions at junctions, narrowing options to emotional exposure. Cost is unmistakable in final image, though "tomorrow’s date" slightly softens urgency; agency shines as candor literally brightens her path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: piecing map = practicing candor, tears strengthening ink reweights honesty without moralizing. Final truncation ("speak the unsent, listen to the") offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ghost made of ink and pollen," "sky like old copper") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Free indirect style ("conversations had begun to disappear too") avoids filter verbs while maintaining interiority; no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("every breath tasted of rust") with purposeful truncation. Minor clunk in "zinc-etched postal plate fragment" slightly disrupts rhythm but doesn’t dull closure. Final image’s "tears blurred the ink further, yet the letters did not dissolve" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis reframes "lost conversations" as physical archive; emotional specificity ("afraid I’ve forgotten how to listen to anything that isn’t echo") avoids drought-allegory tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though greenhouse mechanics slightly verge on familiar eco-fiction.</comment>
