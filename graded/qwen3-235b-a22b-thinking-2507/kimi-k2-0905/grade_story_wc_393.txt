<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emil's guilt manifests in embodied choices (candle fund payment, quoting Rowan's storm-light line), but Rowan remains underdeveloped as a motivation source; minor flaw in secondary character pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes Emil's dual commitment to truth and duty with visible cost ("footsteps syncing with the echo in his chest"); accumulative lens holds through density of sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Repair shop micro-setting directly constrains choices (chronometer spring salvaged), with "vibrant hush" evolving from atmosphere to closure image charging the theme; meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Emil reveals Rowan's evidence list—a meaningful deepening narrowing options—driven by his agency under accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost (systemic injustice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("time—though cracked—kept imperfect, courageous beat") offers resonant answer to redemption question without moralizing; theme emerges purely from Emil's actions and the heart's repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prayers felt like coins flung into a dark well") with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; Olya's dialogue lexicon ("luxuries of the living") contrasts Emil's interiority perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line does triple duty (e.g., "dust motes floated like slow constellations" establishes time/theme/stakes); minor register drift in "aptly deliberate" early on prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical repair and moral contrition avoids cliché; the clockwork heart isn't metaphor but causal engine driving stakes and closure with emotional specificity.</comment>
