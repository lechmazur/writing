<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied exhaustion ("slumped forward") earns closure. But "lucidly watchful" trait remains label-only until late, missing earlier micro-choices that would deepen contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: pool cracks sealing + aurora's approval crystallizes stakes with visible cost (Lirael's exhaustion). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern recognition deepening the echo capture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto’s liquid starlight pool actively constrains choices (cracking threatens collapse), charging the final image. But aurora’s "kiss of light" borders on sentimental; specificity anchors theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation via pool cracking narrows options meaningfully under Accumulative lens. Cost (potential loss of all echoes) is felt but lacks earlier tangible trade-offs; single intensification barely meets scope requirements for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "strange peace" reweights oblivion vs. beauty without moralizing. Final image’s "canvas, waiting" offers resonant answer but risks slight abstraction in "beauty could endure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("emerald chip clutched in her gloved palm") modulates under pressure. Voice maintains lyrical precision ("spiderwebbing with fissures") without head-hopping; rhythm accelerates during infusion climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("coaxing them into the emerald’s lattice like threads through a loom"). Minor overwriting: "radiant hush" repetition and "sharp and clear as a bell" cliché barely dent propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mortuary/beautician roles with celestial echoes avoids tropes. "Embellishing" via moonlight paint transforms stakes organically, but "threshold of stillness" concept leans slightly familiar without deeper rule innovation.</comment>
