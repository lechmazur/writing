<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientist vs believer) drive every micro-choice; memorializing with mother's hair earns closure through embodied cost without therapy-speak. Voss pressures but doesn't dilute her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Wherever the clouds take us" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("it'll change me"). Accumulative lens holds as cloud observations tighten emotional density toward dawn's cirrus spes reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass telescope functions as micro-setting—cold barrel steadies hands, holds mother's hair, becomes "defiant beacon." Constrains choices (aiming at clouds not stars) and charges final image with "dusty starlight" resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through cloud observations deepening (sorrow stratus → rage nimbus → hope cirrus). Agency shifts goal from "prove" to "memorialize" with visible cost: revoked grant, peers' mockery, and identity transformation crystallized in "it'll change me."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spooled wholeness" reweighted by cirrus spes observation—no moralizing. Final image ("threads of possibility") answers central question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding false binaries about memory and loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorologist notices "fractals of rage," "threads of laughter." Rhythm modulates with pressure (short gust sentences → lyrical dawn). Slight register drift in "residual energy" line prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "patina glowing like old coins" shows texture without overwriting. Sentence variety accelerates during gusts ("She gripped the telescope"), breathes at dawn. Minor elevation in "residual energy" metaphor avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms meteorology tropes via emotional cloud taxonomy ("cumulus joyus"). Specificity ("cirrus spes") avoids abstraction; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes through lived detail, not gimmickry.</comment>
