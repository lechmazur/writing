<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between skepticism and wonder emerges late; "skepticism wavered" summarizes rather than shows embodied conflict during transcription. Micro-choice to transcribe earns closure but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with tile's glow and Aelia's presence, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens—the whales' song shift feels atmospheric rather than reweighting stakes with sufficient pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tower and tile function as micro-setting: tile constrains choice via transcription mechanics, charging the final image. However, physical tower details don't alter tactics; "moss" discovery lacks reuse to constrain later actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs wonder) tightens via Aelia's memory of ostracism mirroring Clara's loneliness, but pressure grows passively through received memories rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unheard symphony" motif reweighted by final whale breach, avoiding moralizing. Near-miss: "some mysteries worth embracing" edges toward thematic echo but stays grounded in earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters cosmos through stargazer's lens ("sculpt space for reflection"), but "entangled memories, she thought" uses diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, briefly fracturing POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" label and "unheard symphony" refrain create synonym loops; "whales’ calls rose in pitch" followed by "songs swelled" exemplifies paraphrase redundancy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as memory conduit avoids trope pitfalls, but whale migration framework leans on familiar mystical-nature conventions without sufficient transformation of emotional stakes.</comment>
