<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses (seeking proof vs risking sanity) drive micro-choices like weaving under pressure; final renunciation of rigid reality is earned through embodied cost ("tingling hands," altered memories) without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "memories altered" reconfigures reality’s texture, and the felt price ("unsettling, yet peaceful" calm) crystallizes on-page as she steps into the street with shifted perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sinew thread functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (weaving tactics) and charging the final image ("glowed softly in her pocket"); gallery’s shifting floor/mirrors pressure actions but "vast empty space" lacks sensory specificity in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: Clara’s agency tightens pressure through weaving density until eruption, narrowing options to "weave her own path" with visceral cost ("unraveling sanity" made real through altered memories and the curator’s vanished form).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (thread-weaving as "texture of connection"), not stated; final image ("weave her own path, thread by thread") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite curator’s dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fever dream architect" noticing patterns) and rhythmic control shine under pressure; minor register drift with "rational enchantment" jargon at 80 words prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sinew thread... strong enough to anchor a thought") with clear propulsion. Slight redundancy in "realistically imaginary" repetitions prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" synthesizes tropes through specific thread-weaving mechanics; emotional truth in "unsettling, yet peaceful" calm avoids generic templates. "Fever dream architect" trope slightly familiar but transformed by lived detail.</comment>
