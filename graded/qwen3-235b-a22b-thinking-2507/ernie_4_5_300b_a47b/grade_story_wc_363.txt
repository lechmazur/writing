<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s wistful endurance feels earned through embodied choices (chasing crow, rain-soaked puzzle completion), but emotional abstraction in "grief, joy, longing" slightly dilutes contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with visible cost ("beads dimmed... connection stretched"), though the Accumulative lens slightly obscures causal stakes in the orchard’s song resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bamboo forest functions as micro-setting: creek delivers puzzle box, leaves "trembled with unspoken words," directly constraining Mara’s final weaving choice and charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through puzzle fits (breeze → flute note → full song), with Mara’s agency narrowing options until the irreversible bead sacrifice reweights the dominant "carrying message" stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from weaving/silence motifs; the final "loom still creaks" image answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers," "sap amber bead") and rhythmic control ("Nothing changed. Until...") deepen under pressure; no head-hopping in lyrical third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("sunlight dripped like liquid gold" → "loom’s rhythmic creak"), but minor scaffold in "wistful hope that her loom’s threads could stitch the world back together" slightly dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-spinning legacy and puzzle mechanics avoids trope; bamboo’s active role in the climax transforms "silence" from theme to tactical constraint with emotional specificity.</comment>
