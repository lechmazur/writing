<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "obstacles as instruments" philosophy vs. trembling hands, but final resolution lacks sufficient emotional contradiction; "taste of salt and victory" edges toward tidy resolution without deeper cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (faded mallet patterns, aching arms), but "chaos into order" reconfiguration lacks visceral felt cost; the drifted orchard's transformation needs sharper stakes consequence in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the xylophone mallet's grooves directly constrain choices (angle/grain adjustments) and charge the final image ("patterns now faint under fingertips"); driftwood circle evolves from shattered chaos to resonant mosaic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through mallet strikes aligning with cloud shapes, but the "rogue current" backstory lacks immediate pressure; the cost of transformation (raw fingers, aching arms) isn't sufficiently leveraged during the blue hour climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "dubbing" as metaphor for transformation, but "obstacles are instruments" statement risks thematic echo; final image's "restless euphony" reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "clouds resembling crescendo" and "fractal rhythms"; rhythmic control peaks with "apples thudding to the deck in time," though minor psychic distance slip in "she’d found the mallet years ago."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with "kelp ropes lashed" and "resonance patterns etched," but "like a hive" simile feels stock; paraphrase loop in "layering percussion from the mallet’s taps, the creak of driftwood, and the whisper of kelp ropes" dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and environmental alchemy; the floating orchard transcends trope through tactile driftwood/kelp mechanics, though "tide prophet" title edges toward archetype without deeper cultural grounding.</comment>
