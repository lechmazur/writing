<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lirael’s recklessness is embodied in frayed cuffs and the burned Fool card, but "I want to be gentle" risks therapeutic abstraction. Her contradictory impulses—certainty versus regret—drive the sewing climax credibly, though the boy’s memory feels slightly summarized rather than viscerally reprocessed in the fruit vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Lirael’s "patchwork soul" acceptance forecloses reckless certainty with visible cost (the fruit’s bitter-sweet juice transforming the drowned boy into a lesson). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the cost’s physicality could be sharper in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard’s roots actively constrain Lirael’s movement (crunching bones, parting paths) and charge the ending—skeletons nourishing soil directly enable the sewing ritual. Bioluminescent fungi’s "dusky resolve" mirrors her emotional arc without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes in soul-patching escalate through Lirael’s agency: bartering the Fool card, sewing the skeleton, and eating the fruit narrow options toward earned renunciation of certainty. Cost is legible in the fruit’s "heartbeat not her own" and transformed vision of the drowned boy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—sewing bone with spider-silk thread reweights "fiercely gentle" from label to lived wisdom. Avoids moralizing, but keeper’s "trammel your regret" risks thematic echo; saved by Lirael’s embodied reprise during the fruit vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Lirael notices "calcified fragments" and "teeth like broken shards" through her guilt-tinted lens. Voice modulates perfectly under stress—sentences shorten during sewing ("It pierced easily")—but keeper’s dialogue leans slightly archetypal ("Your past is ash").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pulsed with inner light" and "fiercely gentle force" avoid purple prose. Minor filter verb ("she wondered if") in para 3 slightly dulls immediacy, but "juice bitter and sweet" delivers high-density sensory payoff in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms tarot ritual tropes via tactile specificity: spider-silk thread, calcified bones, and sewing as soul-patching. Risks poetic abstraction but grounds it in Lirael’s frayed coat and the orchard’s visceral logic—no generic "magical forest" clichés.</comment>
