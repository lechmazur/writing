<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation ("translate chaos into order") drives concrete micro-choices (e.g., reconfiguring braids amid sparks), with embodied contradiction (steady hands vs. trembling knees). Final transformation into "weaver of timelines" earns closure through prior causality, though flaw depth (beyond competence) lacks escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the light fading and Elara’s return crystallizes displacement cost ("found herself back") under causal lens. Orientation anchors by 60 words; causal linkage (seal → reconfiguration → door) holds without retroactive patches, though the transition lacks explicit cost articulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The wax seal (recurring object) charges the final image as Elara copies the scroll, while the clock tower’s gears actively pressure choices (sparks during jam, humming post-return). Micro-setting constrains tactics but the chamber’s torches lack causal specificity beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (accessing lost knowledge) tighten through Elara’s agency: the gear jam forces escalation, with displacement as felt cost. Pressure coheres under causal lens, though the "confusion peak" premise isn’t viscerally tested beyond symbolic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—scroll’s shimmering text reweights "absences" as preservable—not moralizing. Final image (light fading, return to mechanism room) offers non-literal answer: knowledge preservation demands displacement, with cost legible in the closed door’s silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air hummed with weight of centuries") and rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during gear jam). Minor deduction for "warmly methodical" label disrupting flow, but compression (e.g., ritual rope insight) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "her fingers deftly untangling and reweaving the threads" slightly loops action. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, though "distorted, elongated form" borders generic. Final line ("gears humming smoothly") crystallizes closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of "fables of absence" as actionable system (not void) feels inevitable. Risk-taking (merging timelines via archivist’s craft) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specific details (phoenix-serpent seal, ceremonial rope braids) transform tropes into organic revelation.</comment>
