<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (twisting wick despite oily darkness) and micro-decisions under pressure. Final endurance as Earned Stasis carries visible cost in "sense of purpose, of possibility" fading yet persisting. No diagnostic labels; laughter as character-particular expression of tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost: "dawn was a choice" reweights premise while the lighthouse image forecloses uncertainty. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (shadows becoming "alive"), with cost legible in "heavier" dawn and lingering "sense of purpose" after shadows fade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lantern wick) constrains every choice and charges closure—final image of lighthouse standing tall reweights prior fragility. Sensory details filtered through urgency ("flame hissed," "wind screamed") evolve causally with events, avoiding static postcard syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: tilting the lantern narrows options to "guide light without drowning in dark." Cost intensifies via emotional weight ("heavier dawn") and conceptual trade-off (light/dark as twins), with pressure cohering under Accumulative lens through shadow density escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—dawn as "choice" crystallized via lighthouse image—avoiding moralizing. Final reconfiguration ("dawn wasn't just a time of day") reweights prior material with social cost (world trading ink for algorithms) while embracing light/dark complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows like liquid night," "laughter like wind chimes in hurricane") modulates rhythm under pressure. Syntax compresses during climax ("She raised the lantern high, and the shadows followed") while maintaining consistent lexicon and psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "fractured light" and "oily shadow" perform dual atmospheric/character work. Final propulsion ("dawn was coming, and she was ready") avoids overwriting while charging closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through specific synthesis: "otherworldly routines" grounded in glass-wick mechanics and "ancient shadows" as active tools. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
