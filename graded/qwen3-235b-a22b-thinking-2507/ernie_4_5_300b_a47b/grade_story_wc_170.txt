<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief/hope) act simultaneously in high-stakes humming; "perceptively calm" demeanor embodies tension without labels. Final endurance earned through physical/emotional cost ("sweating," "chest heaving") during mirror sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "Lirael was sweating" and "chest heaving" crystallize exhaustion from maintaining the harmony. Accumulative lens holds—pressure intensifies via mirror sequence density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains choices (tracing condensation to distort light) and charges final image ("gleamed in fading light"). Terrace’s evolving atmosphere (rain to bells) actively pressures tactics, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: humming’s deepening density ("coded lullabies adapting") narrows options as mirrors react, with visible cost in "sweating" and faltering song. Dominant stake (showing possibilities) viscerally reweights through meadow/city/forest reflections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via final meadow image—a resonant answer to "possibilities beyond edges" without moralizing. Emotional honesty in "borrowed heartbeat" avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers through sister’s silent smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "colors bleed where her touch distorted the light," with rhythmic control under pressure ("song faltered... but she quickened"). No head-hopping; compression during bell sequence teaches pattern paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "prism parapet shimmered as sound waves danced" integrates action/image without scaffold. Minor density in mirror descriptions avoids muddle; final line ("woman with Lirael’s eyes smiled") resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief/magic through "borrowed heartbeat" mechanics—transforms trope via specific stakes (sister’s rhythm as metronome). Emotional truth in "perceptively calm" endurance elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
