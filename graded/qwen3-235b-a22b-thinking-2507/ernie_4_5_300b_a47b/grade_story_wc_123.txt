<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (data vs intuition) drive choices; embodied "hands shook" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of isolation earned by courtyard clinic contrast. Slight tell in "intuit that the quarantine wasn't just a health risk" edges toward diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: burning message sacrifices preservation for truth-sharing with visible cost (safety). Causal lens holds—pigeon note triggers clinic visit. Woman's clinic appearance strains causality but doesn't break closure's cost legibility ("shadow long and thin against the wall").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm recorder constrains choices (altitude sensor adjustment, vial storage) and charges final image ("adjusting altitude sensor one final time"). Fog's evolution from "tendrils" to "oppressive stillness" mirrors internal shift. Micro-setting fully integrates with closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens when recorder alarms at biohazard. Pressure escalates through Elias's agency—rooftop survey, clinic entry—but woman's clinic reveal relies on coincidence, diluting causality. Cost (endangerment) legible in "perimeter lights flared."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through storm recorder's evolution from cataloging to bearing witness. Final image ("quietest places hold loudest truths") reweights courtyard tranquility without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "integrity" mentions. "Engineered flu" reveal slightly oversimplifies institutional critique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fog thickened, blurring courtyard's edges into a smear of gray" reflects Elias's data-driven focus. Voice modulates from clinical ("pressure readings") to lyrical ("stars winked overhead"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts with tension ("heart pounding" during descent).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in paragraph 3 ("He’d been followed... Not by people, exactly") causes -0.2 loop penalty. Otherwise high density: "parchment curl into ash" compresses thematic payoff. Final line’s rhythm ("Elias knew...") avoids drumbeat. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine trope through meteorological lens—ash storms and particulate sensors ground the premise. Risk-taking (quiet Earned Stasis over confrontation) heightens stakes. "Rogue zone" feels fresh via storm recorder's clinical perspective, though institutional villainy lacks nuance.</comment>
