<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s restless routine versus methodical investigation. Embodied emotion peaks when the locket’s weight eases, avoiding diagnostic labels. Final choice to wait—enduring curiosity over departure—earns cost through prior knee pain and Clara’s legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("weight of the locket eased"). Accumulative lens holds via constellation pattern recognition. Orientation clear by line 12; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint (knees/age) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse and fairy ring constrain choices: Elias wades through wrecks, sextant aligns broken stars. Rust on ladder and locket’s roots charge the final image. Micro-setting (mushroom caps) reweights closure as mirror, not portal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (recover memories) tightens through Elias’s agency mapping constellations to wrecks. Cost is felt in locket’s easing weight but lacks visceral physical tradeoff. Escalation deepens via broken-star pattern, foreclosing skepticism for belief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mirror" metaphor: curiosity bridges time without moralizing. Final image ("waited for next broken constellation") resonates as non-literal answer—"eternal" curiosity outweighs stolen memories. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "misplaced" memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crisp nostalgia of old paper and brine") modulates under pressure. Rhythm varies from clipped observations to flowing revelation. Slight over-precision in climax ("wisp of silver light swirled") nudges below 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("pry," "waded," "mapped"). "Crisp nostalgia" avoids cliché; metaphors serve logic (constellations as keys). Final line’s cadence shift recharges "broken" motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-orchard trope via scientific folklorist lens. Emotional specificity in Elias’s curiosity-as-legacy feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; shipwrecks ground the fantastical.</comment>
