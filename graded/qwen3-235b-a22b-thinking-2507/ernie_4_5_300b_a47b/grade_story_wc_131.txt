<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes cleanly around protecting patrons, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "kindly nature" shown through caching yet no friction between patience and urgency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s shift from invisibility to guardianship carries conceptual cost ("no longer invisible") under a coherent Causal lens; city lights steadying while sapphire hush remains crystallizes irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust-capped books and pipe chases function as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image; "sapphire hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to symbol of enduring purpose in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency as the tape reel’s sense memory escalates from curiosity to lifeline; cost is visceral in her identity shift from "invisible" to "guardian" with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of visibility emerges through concrete actions (caching supplies, decoding message), not abstraction; final image—"she felt seen"—resonates without moralizing while reweighting "sapphire hush" as sacred duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("fingers calloused from navigating passages"), but minor register drift occurs when "sense memory" terminology edges toward clinical abstraction during high-pressure decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with zero closure artifacts, yet adjacent beats repeat "methodical" (routine/mind) creating a subtle scaffold loop; no figurative muddle but slight synonym churn in describing pipe chases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library as survival ecosystem avoids dystopian tropes; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens emotional truth, though "Project Lumen" naming leans slightly generic without deeper rule-set transformation.</comment>
