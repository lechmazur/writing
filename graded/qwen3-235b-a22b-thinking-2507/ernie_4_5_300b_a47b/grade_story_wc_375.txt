<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (trading passion for stability vs. suppressed creativity) drives closure; embodied emotion in "soul starved of color" avoids therapy-speak. Final sketching choice earns endurance with cost visible in "chest ache" preceding relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density escalates to Charged Poise closure where shadow-door opening reconfigures options with felt cost ("dam burst inside him"). Orientation clear by 100 words; cost proof in "chest ache" preceding relief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave crystals function as micro-setting that constrains choice (light refraction for painting method) and charges final image (shadow-door). Selective sensory detail ("cold moss," "fractured rainbows") evolves with pressure, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (suppressed creativity vs. stability) tightens through painting process; one meaningful deepening (lock morphing into scream-mouth) forecloses path with cost ("chest ache"). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens but cost legibility slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cobalt streak → shadow-door reconfiguration rejects "stability" without moralizing. Final sketching image ("truly seen") resonantly answers central question; avoids thematic echo via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("charcoal-fingered," light-as-sieve) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("hesitant... freer... stepped back"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during painting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("jagged teeth seemed to pulse") but minor scaffold in para 3 ("traded passion... soul starved"). Near-duplicate "frozen mid-spin"/"jagged teeth" triggers −0.2; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic blockage via crystal-light physics; risk-taking (painting method) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap "portrait artist" for generic creator breaks causal chain of charcoal/canvas choices.</comment>
