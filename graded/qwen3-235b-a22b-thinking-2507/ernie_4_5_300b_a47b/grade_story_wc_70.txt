<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in truthfulness is vivid ("coffee tastes like regret"), but flaw doesn't create tradeoffs during climax; Voss remains opaque despite pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "spark—not of electricity, but of something older" crystallizes conceptual cost of wonder's fragility; lens (Accumulative) holds through sensory reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lightning tower constrains choice via drone failure; "breath fogging the glass" embodies urgency, but occupational details lack causal impact on tactics despite vivid nectar-dusk imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reigniting wonder) tightens through drone discovery and box revelation; cost legible in "collective awe" collapse, but blackout's causality relies slightly on Voss exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (drones pollinating doubt), avoiding moralizing; final image ("world dipped in honey") reweights wonder without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vending machines for electricity") shines; dialogue carries subtext ("You shouldn’t touch that"), but Voss's exposition risks over-articulation in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with strong propulsion, but "syrupy, as if the world were dipped in honey" borders on figurative muddle in closure beat, narrowly avoiding −0.3 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane toll work with wonder mechanics; "pollinating doubt" transforms trope, though lightning tower premise echoes common sci-fi motifs without full reinvention.</comment>
