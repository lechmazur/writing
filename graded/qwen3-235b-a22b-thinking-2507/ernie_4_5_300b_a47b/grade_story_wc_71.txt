<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (understanding "alive" houses) drives concrete micro-choices under pressure, like arranging objects with "slow and deliberate" movements. Contradictory impulses (scientific cataloger vs. mystical believer) act simultaneously in the ritual scene. "Inadvertently profound" risks diagnosis but is redeemed by dream context and embodied cost in the final shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a flawless Charged Poise: the houses’ "faint, golden light" crystallizes Lira’s reconfigured understanding of hush as "potential," with irreversible perceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—the object arrangement’s density increase narrows options until the glow. No causality breaks; the ritual’s escalation is earned by prior object collection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay’s quiet functions as active micro-setting, constraining Lira’s choice to conduct the ritual there because it "amplify[s] the smallest sound." Mud, water lapping, and streetlights daydreaming create tactile specificity that charges the final image—houses pulsing with light against the bay’s stillness—fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding house-aliveness) tighten through Lira’s object arrangement, narrowing options as the air "thickens" toward sanctification. Agency is clear: her placement of the spoon triggers the glow. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift—"the bay, already quiet, became a sanctuary"—though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond atmospheric thickening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (silence as potential) emerges entirely through ritual and image, avoiding abstraction. The final line—"the hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential"—reweights "hush" non-literally with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ test. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the "listening" houses without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "a porch swing creaked in a rhythm that didn’t match the wind" filters the world through Lira’s noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences as air thickens), and "inadvertently profound" fits her voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze" achieves triple duty (atmosphere, time, tone). Propulsion accelerates during the ritual ("air seemed to thicken... glow emanated"). Slight register drift in "sanctification" is voice-motivated by her theory. Final line crystallizes theme with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane observation ("window frame leaned half an inch") with mystical realism. "Displaced objects as anchors" trope transformed through specific, verifiable details (perfumer’s orris root, tarnished spoon). Avoids safety-middle by committing fully to the hush’s conceptual weight without retreat.</comment>
