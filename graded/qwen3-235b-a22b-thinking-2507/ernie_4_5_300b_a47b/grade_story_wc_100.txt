<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (resisting history while welding shards) culminate in earned renunciation ("my rest is here now") with visible cost of worldview abandonment; goldfish memory slightly over-articulated but grounded in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "light erupted—a beam slicing through the water" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (Elias trading shovel for quill); orientation anchored by word 40 with no causality breaks under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (diving suit creak, molten resin welding) actively constrains choices; final image of lens light charging "belonging" proves environment shapes tactics and closure; "bioluminescent ink" slightly touristy but redeemed by tactile book-mending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (redefining rest) tighten through Elias' welding persistence, but escalation lacks meaningful cost escalation beyond internal shift; dominant stake coherent yet pressure peak feels low-stakes for length despite agency-driven closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars ("shovel for quill," goldfish burial); final image reweights "rest" as belonging without moralizing; "chased stillness" avoids sentimentality by tying to physical lens repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' gritty lexicon ("calloused hands," "scoffed") contrasts Marisol's lyrical voice; perceptual signature shines in embalming-fluid-stained hands noticing floating books; minor POV breach in "stubborn nature" label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "glass fractured like a spider’s web" exemplifies textural specificity; "memory pierced him" slightly overwritten but redeemed by immediate tactile action (shard in palm).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms undertaker trope through specific stakes (distress signals as grief metaphor); "permanent address" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; "chased stillness" risks cliché but grounded in physical lens mechanics.</comment>
