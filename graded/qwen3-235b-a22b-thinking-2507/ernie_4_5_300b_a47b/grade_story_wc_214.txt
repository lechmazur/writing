<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("calloused hands," heart holding "grief and wonder"), but "spiritually curious" trait remains stated not tested; Veyra’s shift lacks sufficient prior friction to feel earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: stardust speck crystallizes the cost of Zara’s vulnerability, reconfiguring Veyra’s stance with visible emotional fracture; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric density to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Station’s "faded constellations" and "crumbling plateau" constrain choices (e.g., uneven path to crater), but obsidian shards/bones lack causal pressure; yellow glass charges the final image yet micro-setting integration stops short of 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (science vs. spiritual vulnerability) tightens meaningfully at impact site, but escalation lacks Veyra’s active pressure—his shift feels reactive rather than driven by Zara’s agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically through stardust speck’s reprise; avoids moralizing yet "courage to let go" reflection risks thematic echo, narrowly escaping Q5 penalty with embodied closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet expanse," lantern’s "dawn’s first blush") modulates with cosmic awe, but minor register drift in "primal elegance" during high-stakes walk slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exquisite rhythm ("stars burned so close you could almost touch their light") but scaffolded phrases ("flourishing stillness" ×3) and "patient as stone" cliché trigger −0.2, blocking 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "cosmic janitor" trope through stardust integration and Earned Stasis closure; risks lyrical abstraction but specificity (yellow glass, obsidian shards) anchors universality without gimmickry.</comment>
