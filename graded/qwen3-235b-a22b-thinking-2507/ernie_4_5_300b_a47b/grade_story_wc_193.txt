<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s pyramid-scheme-honed distrust clashing with her "virtuously mischievous" leap to turn the bolt; embodied emotion in "respirator fogging" during her choice. Slight abstraction in "existential dread into resilience" dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: diamonds dissolving into mist while light seeps into cracks makes conceptual cost undeniable ("Pressure translated. Diamonds are a metaphor"). Accumulative lens holds, but Dr. Voss’s "we die" risks melodrama without sufficient prior stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the porthole bolt’s vibration, condensation, and smooth souvenir evolution directly constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy perfect—Mara notices financial metaphors ("translate pressure into diamonds") through her mycologist/survivor lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single tightening (turning the bolt) narrows options decisively under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable in trembling diamonds dissolving and farm stabilization, though Dr. Voss’s "manic curiosity" feels slightly underdeveloped as antagonistic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of the smooth bolt and "shadowseam wonder" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through action: "pressure is a language" texts become earned wisdom via Mara’s tactile choice, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice modulates masterfully—clinical mycology terms ("conceptual pressure") blend with pyramid-scheme cynicism ("virtuously mischievous"). Perceptual signature sharp: Mara decodes the farm through financial metaphors, never touristy cataloging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("hummed," "vibrated," "trembled"). Minor density dip in opening ("existential dread into resilience") but no closure artifacts. Final line recharges "shadowseam" with devastating economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent mycology meets quantum physics via a pyramid-scheme survivor’s lens. Emotional specificity in "translating pressure into resilience" avoids generic tropes; the bolt’s transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
