<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mirror reflections (determination/doubt), but motivation ("rhythm of repair") lacks concrete stakes escalation. Nostalgia reflection anchors present action but cost of mending self remains slightly abstract despite gear revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: ticking clock reweights "frozen" premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout, though final cost ("mend what was broken in himself") could be more viscerally embodied on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library micro-setting constrains choice: rimed mirror edge triggers driftwood nostalgia memory that directly enables the alcove discovery. Final "cold embracing him" charges closure by transforming environmental constraint into emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding gears to mend time) tightens meaningfully at wrong-coat reflection, but pressure lacks teeth—no tangible consequence for failure beyond abstract legacy weight. Liquid light pour drives agency, yet escalation feels slightly weightless for high stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: gears as "connection to the past" crystallizes in Kael's hands, while final clock tick reweights "frozen" library without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "mending time" in tactile brass cogs and personal history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles ("glass singing mournful note," "driftwood nostalgia"), but "weight of that legacy" slightly over-articulates internal state. Rhythmic control falters only in final paragraph's near-theoretical phrasing about "harmony in chaos."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts, but "weight of that legacy" in high-pressure beat risks scaffold tell. Final line ("time, like memory, could always be mended") skirts thematic echo through earned image resonance, avoiding outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Lunar-eclipse locksmith" transforms trope via frost-kissed specificity and emotional repair focus. Avoids derivative fantasy with mismatched-button reflection and driftwood scent, though premise remains recognizable without radical reinvention.</comment>
