<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied micro-choices (redirecting vines, polishing marbles) reveal pragmatic resilience, but Joren’s shift lacks sufficient contradictory impulses; his transformation feels earned yet under-stressed in the pivotal sensor-blocking moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "maze bloomed—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them" crystallizes the cost of embracing flaws. Accumulative lens holds with marbles accumulating meaning, and the orientation test passes by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The marbles function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("polished and proud"), and the maze actively constrains choices (blocking sensors). Minor generic descriptor ("deep green") slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation narrows options when Joren adopts Elara’s methods, forcing the maze to "recalibrate around her." Cost is legible in the maze’s responsive hostility easing, driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "mended deception" reweights "wounds" into growth without moralizing. Final image answers the central question through the maze blooming *because* of cracks, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vines twisted like a question mark," "leaves absorbed light") and rhythmic control under pressure. Joren’s compressed change slightly flattens voice contrast, but compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No closure artifacts; high density ("mended deception" crystallizes theme economically). Minor redundancy in "cracked and chipped, yet polished" creates a 0.2 loop, but final line recharges "wounds" with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Mended deception" transforms gardening tropes through specific, verifiable details (chip as root map). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not revolutionary; avoids derivative safety-middle hedging.</comment>
