<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (trembling hands vs steady voice) and embodied emotion (atoms of nostalgia clinging like lichen), but "end of innocence" epiphany veers into diagnostic label-speak during peak tension, triggering the -0.6 penalty for over-articulated insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully (light pooling as liquid gold = reconfigured truth), with conceptual cost in shedding innocence. Minor causality gap: pagoda's sudden hum after Kael's accusation lacks buildup under Accumulative lens, slightly muddying escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (shifting carvings force active reinterpretation) and charges closure (dipping fingers into light). "Atoms of nostalgia" evolve from metaphor to tangible force, satisfying 9+ gate by shaping final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens through Kael's accusation forcing stance crystallization. Escalation via textural deepening (carvings shifting → glowing → liquid gold) reweights cost, but "end of innocence" abstraction slightly dilutes visceral stakes in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through serpent carving and pagoda-as-seed metaphor, avoiding moralizing until the final line's "end of innocence" nearly triggers -0.8 penalty for thematic echo; saved by being Lirael's internal thought but still over-articulated for peak intensity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes... atoms of nostalgia") and rhythmic control excel, but Lirael's dialogue "Corruption is just another pattern" drifts into academic register during confrontation, violating stress-appropriate diction for a historian avoiding "therapeutic self-awareness".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Masterful density until climax where "anguished joy of the moment" creates mixed metaphor (joy can't be anguished), and three consecutive "she had..." sentences form template cadence. Final-third artifacts cap all categories at 8.8 per rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via saffron veil as "armor against unpredictable truth" and bronze pagoda as living seed. "Atoms of nostalgia" synthesizes historical inquiry with sensory specificity, avoiding derivative premises through charged micro-setting integration.</comment>
