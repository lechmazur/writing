<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete actions (tying threads, noting algae patterns), but lacks deeper contradictory impulses beyond logical/dreamer duality; final choice to continue lacks visible cost escalation beyond the silver thread’s glow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("mouth about to speak... listened") crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds perfectly as pattern density reweights the grotto’s meaning without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto actively constrains choices (air currents for balloons, algae light); altitude gauge (micro-setting) charges finale as Elara straps it "aloft," its steady needle reconfiguring prior tension into earned stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: balloon trials narrow options via pattern density ("17" resonance), with visible cost in the silver thread’s expended energy charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action (weaving threads = equations for hope); final image ("listened") resonates non-literally with crossroads revelation, avoiding moralizing—though "puzzle out equations" phrasing slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mathematical glow of constellations") and rhythmic control during balloon launch; minor register drift in explaining "serene upheaval" slightly disrupts pressure in one beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean from the world where..." uses intentional repetition to build pattern density; final line’s compression ("mouth about to speak. Elara listened") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific precision ("altitude gauge") and poetic magic ("serene upheaval"); risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
