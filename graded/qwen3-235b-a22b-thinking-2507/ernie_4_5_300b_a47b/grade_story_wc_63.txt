<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete details (fractured obsidian shards, warped reflection) avoids abstraction; "ethically diligent" trait remains stated not shown through action tradeoffs, limiting flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with cost (raw hands, sealed cracks); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density but grandfather's advice edges toward tell-y abstraction in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal ridge actively constrains choices (shuddering obsidian, algae-buried rake) and charges final image; micro-setting functions as environment when shards shift like scales during resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ridge's physical deterioration; "incremental absolution" concept drives tactics but dominant stake lacks sufficient friction between Lirael's personal cost and communal duty during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "tiny persistent acts" motif reweighted in final image; avoids moralizing but "restored the balance" risks slight sentimentality undercutting complexity of stone creature's pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured into a thousand pieces," "hummed like syrup") sustains pressure; rhythmic control falters only in grandfather's dialogue which shifts into explanatory register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold until climax where "searing reverie" functions as diagnostic label-speak; artifact in final third disallows 9+ despite otherwise crystalline propulsion and texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clockwork ritual and geological tension feels inevitable; "incremental absolution" reframes familiar balance trope through tactile rake handle mechanics rather than abstract philosophy.</comment>
