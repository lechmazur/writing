<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "poetic logic" vs scholarly rigor; micro-choices (wrapping shard, planting seeds) reveal hierarchy of values with heretic cost. Council antagonism lacks specific adaptation beyond tearing drapes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: shard transforms from "sharp as regret" to "promise" with undeniable conceptual cost (Luminari’s fraudulence). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density; fungi blooming pays off planted seeds with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid constrains every choice: cobalt haze enables storms, soil grows evidence, spires reflect prismatic light. Vase shard as micro-setting charges final image—"courage to see what mirrors hide" reweights prior material through tactile constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (proving historical truth) tightens meaningfully during storm vision. Kael’s agency drives escalation (covering mirrors, planting seeds), but Council opposition lacks deepening—tearing drapes feels reductive for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fungi symbols and shard’s transformation; final line reweights premise without moralizing. "Fungus of revolution" metaphor edges toward thematic convenience but avoids sermonizing through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt haze," "prismatic shards") modulates under pressure; lyrical compression in storm sequence taught early. Minor register drift with "palimpsest" slightly exceeds Kael’s plausible lexicon but fits poetic inclination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shard, sharp as regret") with rhythmic propulsion. Deducted 0.2 for near-duplicate: "refracting it into prismatic shards that danced" followed by "danced across spires" within 15 words—minor scaffold in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory stored in fungal DNA transforms archaeological trope. Risk-taking (covering mirrors during temporal storms) heightens stakes coherently; bioluminescent archive feels inevitable in hindsight with emotional specificity.</comment>
