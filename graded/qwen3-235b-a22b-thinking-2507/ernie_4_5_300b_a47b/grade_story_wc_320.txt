<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Kael discards engineering assumptions to embrace the hush as potential; embodied emotion in "vibrating in his teeth" avoids cliché. Final choice to dismantle the console earns renunciation of obsolete systems with visible cost (fragment's inertness).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the singing river reconfigures silence as rebirth with conceptual cost (fragment's purpose fulfilled). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density peaks when tower shadows "merge into a labyrinth of steel and silence," tightening options via sensory reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower setting actively constrains choice: rusted girders cage frequencies until dismantling creates space for silence. Final image of the gorge’s "river of light" charges closure by transforming mist into liquid energy, fulfilling the micro-setting gate for 9+ band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Kael’s console dismantling narrows options—discarded cogs force reliance on the fragment’s frequency. Cost crystallizes in the fragment’s searing heat and inert aftermath, reweighting "endings as doorways" under the Accumulative lens through visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: the river’s song answers "beginning in every ending" without moralizing. Fragment’s transformation from "azure light" to "dull and inert" charges closure with earned ambiguity—rebirth requires sacrifice, avoiding false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature gleams in technical-poetic diction ("serenely electric static," "holographic map of infrastructure"). Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax during console dismantling ("He slammed... dislodging... began dismantling") mirrors crisis without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "skeletal hand" metaphor deepens rather than distracts. Peak-beat propulsion falters slightly when "shadows stretched toward the moon like spectral fingers" overwrites tension—dense imagery risks slowing the lunar perigee climax without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "celestial signal interpreter" transforms radio salvage into mystical practice. Hollywood fragment as mirror (not relic) feels inevitable in hindsight—avoids derivative tropes by rooting rebirth in technical dismantling, not magic.</comment>
