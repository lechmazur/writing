<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (yearning for fire vs ancestral ban) act simultaneously through embodied choices: trembling hands adjusting gear, heart aching for warmth while respecting elders. Final renunciation of fire-as-violence earned by ghost encounter and gear's calculations with visible cost in parents' scars. No label-speak; micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: parents' scarred hands and elders' fire ban crystallized in "gentler flame" final image. Accumulative lens holds throughout—sonar pinging and petal descent deepen generational pattern understanding. Cost proof evident in "scars" and "ban" details during ghost confrontation, reconfiguring options via "Transit" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden micro-setting constrains choices: crystalline trees host ghost encounter, falling petals evolve from "drifted constellations" to "silent applause" charging closure. Gear's mother-of-pearl material and petal physics directly shape tactics (decoding frequencies, final placement). Recurring object (petals) charges final image as "gentler flame" promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling fire/light) escalates through agency-driven deepening: sonar pinging urgency forces Lumin deeper, ghost confrontation crystallizes stance. Cost visible in parents' scars and elders' rejection, narrowing options to "quiet fire" path. Pressure tightens under accumulative lens via petal/sonar cadence shifts reweighting generational patterns with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "generational patterns were bridges" shown via gear's calculations and ghost's "light is fire, quieter kind," not stated. Final image ("gentler flame") resonates as non-literal answer to "why abandon fire?" Avoids thematic echo—ghost articulates fire as language, not theme, preserving earned ambiguity about ancestral choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations," sonar vibrating "through bones") modulates under pressure: shorter phrases during ghost encounter ("You've come to ask why"). Rhythmic control evident in "Transit" whisper crystallizing realization. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style maintains consistent cosmic-sentimentalist lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout: "relic forged from dying star, teeth approximating infinity" conveys character, setting, theme. No figurative muddle—metaphors coherent (fire as thief/language). Final line "gentler flame" crystallizes theme without cliché. Minor register drift in "approximating infinity" costs 0.1 but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "generational patterns" trope via specific cosmic mechanics: fire's healing paradox and "quiet flame" concept avoid safety middle. Emotional truth in parents' scars vs. dream-blaze. "Transit" reconfiguration feels fresh yet inevitable, synthesizing gear's calculations and ghost's lesson into bold, coherent vision without abstraction.</comment>
