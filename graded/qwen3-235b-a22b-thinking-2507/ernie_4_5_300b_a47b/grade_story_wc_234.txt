<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (precision/awe vs surrender) act in scene during shell alignment; final choice to welcome uncertainty earns CR with visible cost of past failures. Slightly idealized competence in solution mitigated by three prior explosions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as CR with undeniable conceptual cost: "transformed failure into alchemy itself" crystallizes stakes. Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) holds; pressure escalates via ledger discovery to perspective shift. Minor causality gap in shell-engine mechanics acceptable for CR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (sun engine/columella) constrains choice and charges final image: "learned to paint with it" reweights tools. Sensory specificity ("shards of cooled lava") pressures urgency. Slight visual-overload in climax slightly dilutes haptic detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: ledger discovery forces reevaluation of "revalue" concept, narrowing options from forcing resonance to collaborative alignment. Cost unmistakable in "three sun engines lost" and conceptual shift. Stakes could feel more visceral beyond city's chill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ending offers resonant non-literal answer: "paint with [palette]" reweights prior struggle without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete action (shell alignment), avoiding thematic echo. "Philosophy" label slightly on-the-nose but redeemed by embodied closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("logarithmic curl," "density of presence") modulates under pressure; Jorin's pragmatic dialogue contrasts Elara's poetic interiority. Rhythmic control in climax ("thousand crickets waking"). Minor register drift in "philosophy" mention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shards of cooled lava" implies explosions). Varied syntax accelerates during engine hum. Figurative language purposeful ("moth in amber"). "Scientifically romantic" slightly abstract but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy as perspective shift transforms "palette" trope. Emotional truth in scientist's struggle with failure. "Density of presence" concept avoids abstraction through gear alignment. Slightly familiar "aha" moment grounded in prior struggle.</comment>
