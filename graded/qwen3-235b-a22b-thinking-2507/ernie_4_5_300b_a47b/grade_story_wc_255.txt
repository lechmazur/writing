<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' colorblindness drives embodied contradiction—gray canvases versus "vibrancy where others saw void"—with micro-choices like rejecting pigments then mixing cobalt dust. Marla's "imperfection" backstory reveals motive through action, not therapy-speak, though her phoenix confession risks over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via Elias' violet brushstroke and humming plants, crystallizing "beauty in cracks" with visceral cost (permanent perceptual shift). Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates from reed tongue clicks to fractal symphony, foreclosing his grayscale existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass courtyard functions as micro-setting: orbs refract light onto Elias' mural, constraining his colorless art until cobalt dust transforms them into harmonic conduits. Final image—ivy-woven phoenix—charges closure by repurposing shards as growth medium, though "molten-gold" reed tongue slightly strains physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving beauty in imperfection) tightens through Elias' agency: arranging withered rose risks failure, then cobalt dust forces irreversible perceptual cost. Escalation via Accumulative lens—plants' rustling to symphony—narrows options to embracing flawed vision, though Marla's confession slightly softens tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shattered glass bird fuels phoenix fire, rose thorns weave new wings. Avoids moralizing via moth's "awaken" whisper and final "started to see" line, but Marla's "beauty isn't in perfection" risks thematic echo in peak moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias' perceptual signature filters world through texture ("brass keys glinting like molten gold," "fractals that pulsed like a heartbeat"). Stress compresses syntax during mural's eruption, while Marla's shattering-glass laugh distinctively contrasts his internal cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose sings with textural specificity ("prismatic shadows," "leaves rustling in a language he almost understood"), but "thousand shades of green" edges toward purple prose in high-stakes beat, slightly muddling the fractal revelation's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms colorblindness trope via glassblower symbiosis—flaws literally fuel rebirth. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through Charged Poise closure, though phoenix backstory slightly echoes mythic templates without full novelty.</comment>
