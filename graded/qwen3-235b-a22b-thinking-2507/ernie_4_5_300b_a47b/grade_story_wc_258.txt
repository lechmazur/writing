<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (data vs. mysticism) but Mara’s characterization lacks depth; her "frayed" voice doesn’t sufficiently pressure Elara’s choices beyond exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with valid Charged Poise closure; "scars could be maps" crystallizes cost. Minor softness in escalation—pressure grows via pattern density but lacks a tangible mid-scene trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight constrains choices (light as lens, damp wood smudging cards) and charges the final image; measuring tape’s "cold precision" directly shapes the closure’s rebuilding ethos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping cultural collapse) tightens via pattern accumulation, but Mara’s arrival lacks tangible cost escalation; conceptual cost lands cleanly in closure though emotional stakes feel thin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "reverse engineering chaos" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights "scars" as maps without stating a moral, though "inherited mystery" risks abstraction without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp wood," "silver serpent" tape) and rhythmic control shine, but Elara’s lexicon drifts toward academic diction ("conceptual repricing") under pressure, muddying voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but high-density figurative language ("glass dripped like a thousand inverted hourglasses") risks overwriting in early beats; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data mysticism avoids trope; specificity ("fractal tattoo," "three feet, seven inches") grounds universals. Risks lyric abstraction but cohesion rescues it from derivative territory.</comment>
