<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skeptic/imagination) drive choices credibly, but final "doubted/knew" lacks tangible cost; micro-choices like trembling hands during shard insertion reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (memories freed = permanent change), but marble discovery feels coincidental rather than earned; sidereal patience motif insufficiently motivates drain location.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stained glass box functions as micro-setting constraining choices (clouded→transparent), charging final image; however, fountains remain passive backdrop until climax, failing to pressure early decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via breadcrumb density tightens options effectively, but cost remains abstract (scraped fingers minor); "defiance" motivation lacks visceral stakes until final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (breadcrumbs, patience), avoiding moralizing; final line ("truths worth waiting for") resonates without stating moral, though "sidereal patience" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes like fractured starlight," "bruised sky") with stress-appropriate compression; minor register drift in "sidereal patience" prevents 9.0 despite rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "bruised sky"/"ashen residue" cluster risks overwriting; final third clean, yet "felt or conceptual cost" phrasing echoes rubric language, dulling closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-water metaphor with specific details (dried violet, rusted nail); risk distinction (+0.3) for Accumulative structure, but "breadcrumbs" concept lacks transformative novelty for 9.0.</comment>
