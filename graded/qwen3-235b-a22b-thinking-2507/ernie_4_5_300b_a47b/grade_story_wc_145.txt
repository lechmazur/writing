<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to uncover rivers' "reasons" drives her choices with embodied contradiction (confidence vs. vulnerability). Jorn's warnings deepen stakes without flattening her agency. "Rivers are alive" edges toward label-speak but redeemed by visceral cost of snow burial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "Maps are lies" crystallizes her shattered worldview. Accumulative lens holds through sensory buildup (condensation patterns, ice groans) culminating in the light-revelation beat. Orientation anchors by line 5 prevent disorientation penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake setting constrains every choice: snowshoes, thermos coffee, pitted ice requiring pickaxe. The glowing ice shard charges the final image while the outpost's rust and condensation patterns mirror internal shifts. Sensory details (pine resin cigarette, hissing stove) filter through Clara's cartographer lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake—"finding rivers' reasons"—tightens when the map reveals light as source, forcing Clara to abandon geological assumptions. Her agency drives escalation (trekking north, chipping ice) with visceral cost (half-buried in snow, raw voice). Jorn's warnings deepen tension without resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: phrasebook dog-ears, salinity vial, and glowing ice shard reconfigure "maps as promises" into "reminders there's more to find." Final image of rivers flowing with "secrets safe" avoids moralizing while charging the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices condensation fractals and dog-eared phrasebook pages while ignoring cold. Rhythmic control shifts from measured ("skeletal relic") to compressed ("rivers... alive") under stress. Jorn's rasping dialogue creates intentional contrast without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "streak of gray against iron sky" and "ghostly plume" avoid mixed metaphors. Sentence propulsion through concrete verbs ("chipped," "crawled," "traced"). Final line's "falcon laughed" achieves high-density lyricism without sacrificing clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes via cartographer's lens: rivers of light feel fresh yet grounded in Clara's salinity test and phrasebook. Emotional specificity in her quiet resolve ("truths meant to be chased") avoids generic wonder. The convergence concept synthesizes geology and mysticism without gimmickry.</comment>
