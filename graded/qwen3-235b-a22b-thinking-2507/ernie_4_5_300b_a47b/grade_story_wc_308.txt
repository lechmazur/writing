<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels like "resolve weathered" without embodied contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as no conflicting impulses act during climax. Diagnostic phrasing ("paradox that had consumed generations") triggers -0.5 penalty in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("to navigate without moving was to listen"), but cost lacks visceral embodiment—weathered resolve stated not shown. Orientation solid by word 15, lens (Accumulative/Textural) held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: bone towers constrain choices (ledge carvings), arrowhead charges final image ("tucked safely against his chest"). "Bruised sky" cliché costs 0.3, but environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening—birds' arrival passive, no trade-off. Pressure deepens via pattern density (figure-eight), but cost remains abstract without dramatized tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo destroys resonance: "to navigate without moving was to listen" states thesis outright in final paragraph, replacing scene pressure. Otherwise earned through bird patterns, but -0.7 penalty for sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sensory hierarchy (echoes prioritized over sight), but "pulse left wandering" recurs as unearned poetic abstraction violating POV lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density muddles peak beats: "skeletal fingers," "pulse left wandering," and "mosaic of battles" collide in opening. Mixed vehicle ("mosaic" visual vs "reverence" auditory) triggers -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope via stone-skimmer mechanics and bone-carving specificity, but "figure-eight = renewal" is clichéd. Emotional truth in struggle with stillness elevates, yet pulse concept feels derivative.</comment>
