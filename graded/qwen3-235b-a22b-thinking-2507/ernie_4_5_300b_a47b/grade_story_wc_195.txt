<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("shivering bliss" as dread/euphoria) and embodied emotion (rusty laugh, trembling fingers) drive credible transformation. Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices, though alchemist memory intrusion slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation failure: "endless night" at 120 words lacks era/locale anchors, triggering -0.5 penalty. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost ("strings never meant to hold you"), but disorientation doesn't serve final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Q2 orientation penalty caps score. Greenhouse details (moon-petals, alchemical vines) vividly constrain choices, yet setting remains postcard-like without early era anchoring. "Rusted iron bench" could've grounded time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize via "unsnap the strings" action with visible cost (machinery destruction, armor loss). Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds through reality shifts, though "shivering bliss" introduction lacks causal setup in pressure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "strings" motif evolving from literal (marionette) to conceptual (patterns), avoiding moralizing. Final line delivers Conceptual Repricing by reframing captivity as liberation, with cost in the greenhouse's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath crystallized on armor") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift: "shivering bliss" risks abstraction but redeemed by "dread and euphoria" embodiment in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats, but "reality shifted" repetition creates paraphrase loop in escalation. "Shivering bliss" borders on therapy-speak yet avoids penalty by charging final image with concrete sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppetry tropes through alchemical logic. Risk distinction: transforming "capture possibility" from literal to experiential reweights emotional truth without gimmickry, making the greenhouse's collapse inevitable.</comment>
