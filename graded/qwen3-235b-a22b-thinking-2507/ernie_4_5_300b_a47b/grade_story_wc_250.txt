<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation ("teach darkness the value of stars") is clear and action-driven, but lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle—her calmness remains untested under pressure, reducing emotional complexity. No internal conflict emerges when the fisherman questions her, missing a chance to show tension between silence and communication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: lingering patterns reconfigure the dock’s meaning with conceptual cost (endless cyclical labor), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of light patterns. Cost is legible in "darkness would always return," though slightly abstract for top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt dock and dental mirror function as micro-setting that charges the closure—shutters constrain light manipulation tactics, and the mirror’s final "cool against her skin" reweights the opening gift. Rain-slicked planks directly enable the light-refraction mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (soothing canal’s "unspoken ache") deepen through pattern density, but cost remains conceptual (perpetual duty) rather than viscerally felt. Agency in shutter manipulation narrows options, yet the "stillwater tension" lacks escalation beyond softening—no tangible loss or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "weave light into the void" avoids moralizing, and the final lingering patterns offer resonant CR without stated moral. Fisherman’s unanswered question deepens subtext, though "silent empathy" borders on thematic echo without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice has distinct lyrical texture ("bruised sky like a bruise on glass"), but overwriting risks dilute immediacy—e.g., "serenity that wound through her like ivy" feels ornamental. Consistent POV filters details through Lira’s sensory focus, though stress compression undercuts peak-beat urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose excels in specificity ("frayed cord," "chipped blue shutters") but suffers paraphrase loops: "refracting them into patterns only she could see" echoes earlier mirror descriptions. Near-overwriting in "thrummed with unseen currents" slightly muddles tension without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror as empathy tool elevates trope, but "spiralingly calm" attribute feels untested. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence, though premise lacks bold deviation from "light vs. darkness" archetypes despite vivid execution.</comment>
