<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite vivid setting; Kael's "melancholy" lacks embodied contradiction during climax. Final choice (singing) forecloses no path with visible cost—eternal burden feels conceptual, not felt. Micro-choices absent in pivotal stone-circle revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (eternal memory-keeping), but hooded figure’s exposition replaces earned causality. "You’ve come to learn" leap undermines Accumulative lens—revelation happens *to* Kael, not *through* his actions. Orientation solid within 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment as constraint: canyon’s stone resonance directly shapes Kael’s tactics (pressing shell to fissure) and charges closure (shell at heart). Final image reweights "serpentine nexus" from setting to living memory-vessel. Micro-setting (seashell) essential to all beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake ("why some echo") tightens through lullaby voice discovery, but pressure lacks protagonist agency—Kael *receives* revelations passively. Conceptual cost (eternal burden) is unmistakable, yet escalation relies on hooded figure’s convenience, not Kael’s choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "echoes as trapped memories" reweights via seashell’s glow and flashing images. Final line ("canyon sing back") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo despite figure’s dialogue—phrasing feels character-rooted, not authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hummed with universe’s secret song"), but "reed-blown melancholy" recurs identically under peak stress, flattening rhythm. Hooded figure’s dialogue drifts into thematic exposition ("refuse to let go"), straining Accumulative voice. Otherwise consistent psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in ascent sequence ("Kael paused... Kael continued...") dulls propulsion. "Frayed"/"torn hole" metaphor cluster slightly muddles physical logic. Final paragraph’s "weaving through the nexus" overwrites the earned simplicity of "canyon sing back." No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "canyon echoes" trope via seashell’s memory-resonance mechanic—fresh synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in conceptual closure (no physical act, only stance crystallization) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative "wise elder" cliché through figure’s sharp eyes and tangible cost.</comment>
