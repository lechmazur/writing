<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; Kieran's "ember" drive is told, not shown through internal struggle. No visible cost in final choice—success feels unearned despite stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise (descending into cradle), but cost remains implied, not legible. "Blackout won't last" hints at risk but lacks on-page consequence to satisfy cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid twilight/amber light anchors atmosphere, but setting doesn't constrain choices. Sundial/quill holder function as tools, not environmental pressures—their symbolic weight overshadows tangible impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (exposing Council) escalate causally via blackout/sundial, but pressure lacks teeth—no tangible opposition or paid cost. "Test" theory remains abstract; cost feels deferred rather than unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "light flickered in ideas" final image, avoiding moralizing. But "cradle of sparks" leans slightly abstract, diluting the non-literal answer's visceral charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Kieran's angle-focused observations), but "burned like an ember" overwrites internal tension. Dialogue subtext ("Still at it, Sentinel?") elevates naturalism without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm with minor scaffold: "His motivation burned like a ember" redundantly echoes later "spark revolution." Template cadence in action beats ("Kieran held... Elara traced...") slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intellectual revolution (no violence), but "sundial cipher" trope slightly dilutes ingenuity. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
