<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction surfaces late but lands powerfully in climax ("fear of oblivion" vs claiming "I am the extinction"), with embodied cost during canyon's roar. Slightly underdeveloped internal tension pre-climax limits 9+ eligibility despite strong closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density escalates to Charged Poise when echoes still and birds freeze, with visible cost (slipping fingers, searing palm). Closure’s conceptual repricing—canyon as hungry mirror—reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices (bone towers’ narrow ledge, canyon’s echo distortion) and charges final image—the diamond’s lingering song in her mind. Flawed diamond as micro-setting shapes every key beat with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: bird-pattern observations tighten into humming that fractures the diamond’s vein. Cost is visceral (burning palm, near-fall) and conceptual (fear of oblivion weaponized), reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—texture-to-sound translation—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("languages meant to be felt, not spoken") resonantly answers central question without stating a moral, though secondary stakes slightly dilute thematic focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "shadows streaked like ink on parchment," "hummed... geometry of vibrations." Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (shortening syntax during canyon’s roar), with consistent copper/vein imagery anchoring voice. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless in climax: "diamond flared... cracks emitting different tones" avoids figurative muddle. Minor synonym loop ("tracing cracks"/"tracing jagged path") but no scaffold; final line’s image recharges motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed object" trope through sensory translation premise; risk-taking (math-as-music, oblivion-as-identity) heightens stakes coherently. Fresh synthesis of texture/sound/cosmology feels inevitable, though bone towers verge on familiar fantasy iconography.</comment>
