<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("analytically, her mind untangling threads") with diagnostic phrasing in peak tension; contradictory impulses lack active scene demonstration despite strong backstory integration through snow globe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("learning to shake the globe...feel resonance in her own bones") crystallizes quantum grief with undeniable conceptual cost; accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition (hum frequencies) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library’s pressure-warped shelves and snow globe function as micro-setting that constrains choices (tape discovery) and charges final image; sensory details filtered through physicist’s bias ("12-second loop," "440 Hz") avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (memory persistence/dissolution) deepens via frequency pattern discovery; cost ("quiet, analytic ache") legible but slightly abstract; agency in analytical choices (rewinding tape) drives accumulative escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through snow globe’s reprise without moralizing; final line ("language for the quiet ache") offers resonant non-literal answer to "physics of letting go" by reweighting Earhart’s transmission as grief’s phase transition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow globe’s mechanism—a tiny motor that created a storm inside glass") but register drift in "analytically, her mind untangling threads" undermines voice during emotional climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("time seemed to pool in the silence") with propulsion; single filter-verb stack ("her hands trembled as she rewound") slightly dulls immediacy but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms Earhart mystery through quantum physics lens; snow globe’s emotional specificity ("fogged with decades of unspoken grief") avoids trope reliance while risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
