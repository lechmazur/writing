<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("capable of violence" vs. "magic for good") embodied in physical reactions; micro-choices like releasing the seed reveal values with cost. Slight emotional arithmetic in final acceptance slightly undercuts the "chest tightened" rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "heart lighter" contrasts "chest tightened" during memory reveal, reconfiguring options through the seed's transformation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density escalation to the spore vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard vortex actively constrains choice (pulling Mira in) and charges closure via "trees stilling as if in respect." The flesh-eating seed functions as micro-setting, its physical properties (hunger, light) directly altering tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (confronting buried guilt) tighten through Mira's agency: stepping in, releasing seed, facing vision. Cost is unmistakable in "chest tightened" and the "poisoning" guilt, culminating in the earned shift to "heart lighter" with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the seed's transformation: "strength to carry [darkness]" resonates via the final image of the spent seed in her pocket. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in "capable of violence" coexisting with self-defense.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("bark-rough hands," "scent of decaying fruit and ozone"); syntax compresses under stress ("She stepped forward"). Rhythmic control peaks in the vortex's "invisible hands" pull, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("guarded, heart locked behind walls... urge to unbend") slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high density ("vines writhing like serpents") and propulsion; final line's "worth keeping" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms guilt tropes via druidic specificity (flesh-eating seed as truth-revealer). Emotional truth in morally ambiguous violence avoids safety hedging; the "warlike serenity" tone synthesizes conflict into a fresh, inevitable angle.</comment>
