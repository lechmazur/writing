<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation burns clear ("hush the chaos before it devours peace") with embodied micro-choices (knees on moss, breath steadying during ritual). Contradictory impulses—calm focus vs. underlying dread ("this was different")—act simultaneously at climax without therapy-speak, earning closure through visible cost (crumbling wing).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: brook's resumed murmur crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable cost (wing dissolving in palm). Accumulative/Textural lens holds from midpoint ("map the silence, her mind tracing contours") through payoff, with density escalation (ripples stilling, fireflies pausing) narrowing options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: water's reflection enables prophecy code ("crane’s wing drinks brook’s reflection"), while final murmur reweights the haven’s peace. Sensory hierarchy (fireflies as embers, moss cushioning) filters through summoner’s ritual urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens via protagonist agency: ritual deepens from tracing wing folds to mapping "gaps between heartbeats," narrowing options as brook stills. Cost is unmistakable in "crumbling to dust" with visible consequence (tranquil blaze extinguished if failed), fulfilling band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual particulars—silence as "language" mapped via paper fibers absorbing water—not abstraction. Final brook murmur offers resonant, non-literal answer to "hush the storm" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material through the crane’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "terrestrially cosmic" gaze filters fireflies as "embers," brook as "lull." Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (short clauses during ritual climax: "The brook’s ripples stilled. The fireflies paused."), with consistent psychic distance that avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "distorting the fireflies’ light into fractured constellations" does triple duty (image, metaphor, stakes). Minor register drift in "terrestrially cosmic" avoids penalty as voice-motivated lexicon, with zero paraphrase loops even in high-pressure beats like the closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope through specific synthesis: origami crane as "fragility and precision" tool to weaponize silence. Emotional truth anchors universals in verifiable details (paper fibers absorbing water), with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightening stakes without gimmickry—inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
