<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Eleanor withdraws her hand despite years of controlling variables, embodying the control/surrender conflict. Minor slip: "stifling her work" risks label-speak but is redeemed by immediate physical action of watching the withered plant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—"Nature wasn’t something to be tamed" crystallizes renunciation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via cadence shifts, but cost proof slightly weakened by "stifling" abstraction despite prior embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trellis moss swells under Eleanor during epiphany, charging the final image where vines "weave like veins." Micro-setting constrains choice (her seated position during realization) and reweights closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) tightens when Eleanor withdraws her hand, foreclosing intervention. Cost is legible via professional identity shift, but "stifling her work" slightly overstates the conceptual price needed for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through linden leaf’s evolution from observed object to pocketed symbol; final line ("transformed because of chaos") avoids moralizing by grounding insight in storm season’s physicality. "Circuitously sincere" repetition skirts thematic echo but stays diegetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"damp fibers clinging like second skin" shows botanist’s tactile focus. Rhythmic compression during hellebore splitting ("Eleanor hesitated. For years...") modulates voice under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rain pattered, moss swelling" varies syntax to propel scene. "Circuitously sincere" appears three times but pattern-teaches meaning escalation (admiration → explanation → shared mantra), avoiding overwriting penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical precision ("Helleborus retracting") with human transformation. Risk-taking in making plant agency undeniable ("they’d come on their own") heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming a familiar premise through specific horticultural stakes.</comment>
