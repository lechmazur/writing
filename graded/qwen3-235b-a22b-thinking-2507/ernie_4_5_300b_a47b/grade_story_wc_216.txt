<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied grief (urn fragment pressing thigh) and banker-to-poet contradiction drive choices. Final renunciation of the urn feels earned through tactile interactions, though internal tension between precision and poetry could deepen slightly at peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "mosaic of moments" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (urn left behind). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via poetic descriptions rewiring capsule mechanics, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting: rusted hatch constrains access, mercury’s gravity defiance alters tactics. Final image ("first stars pricked the sky") charges closure by reweighting time’s texture through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time’s texture) tightens through Elias’s descriptions triggering artifact responses. Cost legible when urn fragment "vibrated" to show his wife—visible tradeoff of relinquishing the talisman for insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through urn’s "suddenly" and mercury’s behavior—no moralizing. Final image reweights "borrowed time" as "fragile and infinite" mosaic without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: banker’s "ledger entries" lexicon ("frayed cufflinks") clashes with poetic object descriptions. Rhythmic control peaks during mercury’s transformation—"sloshed lazily, defying gravity" to "perfect sphere."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "static dissolving into static" shows syntactic precision. Minor abstraction ("timelessness was layering") redeemed by immediate concrete action ("shadows shifted"). Final line’s "whispers" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via garage-sale method and urn fragment. "Texture of time" premise feels inevitable through Elias’s banker grief—specific verifiable detail (thrift-store urn) avoids quirky ornament.</comment>
