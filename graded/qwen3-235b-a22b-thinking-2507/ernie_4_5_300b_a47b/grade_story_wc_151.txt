<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through micro-choices (tracing chalk, scanning margins) and embodied emotion (breath hitching at code match). Final choice to continue grandmother's work is earned by hologram reveal, though "motivation crystallized" edges toward abstraction without sufficient contradictory impulse in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the final image of Lira walking on with "clipboard humming" reweights the arcade as an archive with undeniable conceptual cost (generational loss). Causal lens holds perfectly—"because/therefore" chain from margin code to fountain compartment to hologram revelation creates irreversible knowledge shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Golden arcade isn't backdrop but active constraint: dawn light refracting through fountain water directly enables code matching, while cobblestone chalk patterns dictate decryption tactics. The solar-gel fountain's prismatic patterns charge the final image as both tool and thematic anchor, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decoding the message to understand the past) tightens through Lira's agency: scanning margins narrows options to fountain search, with conceptual cost (realizing the Collapse didn't erase "us") made visceral via grandmother's hologram. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—chalk codes as resistance language, surface mail as rebellion—not abstraction. Final image ("reinventing it") offers non-literal answer to "futuristic nostalgia" without moralizing, though naming the tone early slightly reduces earned resonance. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (teaching children).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cryptographic details ("geometric fragments," "light's frequency") and stress-appropriate syntax compression ("She hurried downstairs"). Rhythmic control excels in climax, though "carefully inventive" AI line risks slight register drift from Lira's voice during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("boots clicking like a countdown" advances plot and emotion). Minor cliché ("breath hitched") in peak beat prevents 9.0, but final line ("rhythm as timeless as chalk spirals") avoids sentimentality through concrete image. No figurative muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific, grounded choices: surface mail isn't nostalgia but coded resistance, with solar-gel fountain and kinetic clipboard creating fresh logic. Emotional truth in quiet resolve (vs. heroics) and "chalk coding" synthesis feels inevitable. Bold risk in making climax a hologram revelation, not physical confrontation.</comment>
