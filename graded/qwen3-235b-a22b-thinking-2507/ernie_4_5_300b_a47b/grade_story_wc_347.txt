<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; Kael’s "reluctance" is stated but lacks embodied duality (e.g., no simultaneous pull toward/away from duty during key choices). Final endurance is earned, yet emotional specificity falters in high-stakes beats like the fountain confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with legible cost (cracked nut, frost bloom), satisfying Situational lens. Orientation anchors within 40 words, but the "offhandedly exact" blueprint reflection risks over-explaining without altering present tactics, narrowly avoiding BRR penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nut functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (placement without touch) and charging the final image (cracked shell). Frost’s evolution—from gravel to blooming silver—concretely mirrors the cost, avoiding static description through causal integration with the curse’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kael’s agency under Situational pressure (birds forcing stealth during stone placement), but the traveler’s whimper as primary motivator lacks layered conflict with his reluctance. Cost is felt in the nut’s crack and resetting labyrinth, though the frost’s consequence remains slightly oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect stewardship emerges through "graceless beauty" in action (tilted stones, snapped branches), culminating in the cracked nut’s resilience. Final image reweights the curse’s demand without moralizing, but the blueprint’s "offhandedly exact" descriptor slightly over-signals the thematic contrast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters world through Kael’s tactile, strained perception ("discordant hum that set his teeth on edge"), yet stress-induced compression stumbles in the blueprint reflection block where syntax over-smooths his urgency, diluting psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in the blueprint backstory ("assembled fragments... coalesced in his mind") slightly stalls momentum. Otherwise, high density prevails—e.g., "shadows slicing through twilight" fuses setting and threat—but the reflection’s abstract phrasing risks diluting peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical birds with organic curse avoids trope clichés, and "graceless beauty" offers non-obvious emotional truth. However, the reluctant caretaker archetype lacks sufficient transformation through lived detail, hovering near safety-middle without bold risk-taking.</comment>
