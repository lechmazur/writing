<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (serene anger vs desperation) manifest physically in ink-spilling method; brother's absence drives micro-choices like kneeling to trace circles. Final entry into tower earned by accumulated pattern recognition with visible cost: "memory of her brother—vanished forever."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: stepping through ink-flaring door crystallizes options (truth vs oblivion) with conceptual cost of time's fragility. Accumulative lens holds—patterns intensify (ink→hologram→child's drawing)—and cost proof lands in "before the ink—and the memory of her brother—vanished forever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Disappearing ink constrains choice (must read patterns before vanishing) and charges closure (door handle revealed by ink flare). Sand functions as micro-setting: "shifting beneath boots" during pivotal stance shift, "residue that hummed" reweights time's physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (time fragmentation vs preserving memory) tightens through pattern accumulation: ink reveals tower, child's drawing confirms "time gets stuck." Agency in Lira's intuition ("snapping into focus") drives escalation; conceptual cost legible in "memory of her brother—vanished forever" at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: child's "time gets stuck. Like a song on repeat" reweights time as breath-like fragility. Final image (stepping through ink door) resonates as non-literal answer—truth requires embracing transience—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo in closing beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "fractal spirals," "residue that hummed like tuning fork." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("She stood, the sand shifting beneath her boots" vs. dense ink-description). Psychic distance shifts intentionally when child speaks, preserving Lira's tactile focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in elders' warning ("Time slows here because it *chooses* to" echoes prior line) but no artifacts in peak beats. High density: "spill the ink... read the truth in the shapes before they vanished" compresses method/stakes. Final line ("stepped inside") crystalline with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time anomaly rendered as ink patterns rather than sci-fi tropes. Emotional specificity in child's "time gets stuck" line avoids abstraction. Transformation test passed—swapping "disappearing ink" for generic "hologram" would break fragility motif central to closure.</comment>
