<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "I can’t" versus "Lead on" choice, but emotional layering lacks depth during death vision; identity fraying feels abstract rather than embodied under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with visible cost ("bought time"), causal lens holds through trapdoor decision; sunset deadline tightens options but lagoon threshold rule lacks testing before Joran’s warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon’s reflective quality charges the parley scene, but debris method doesn’t constrain final tactics; chamber collapse relies on plot device rather than setting-evolved choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from Elara’s warning to Mara’s death vision, culminating in trapdoor choice that sacrifices codex retrieval; Preservation Society reveal feels slightly convenient but cost ("truth’s out there") lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through skin-bound codex and "history’s written by victors" line; "bought time" avoids moralizing but edges toward thematic echo without deeper resonance in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s perceptual signature strong ("ink-stained fingers," "symbols pulsed like heartbeat"); dialogue stumbles slightly in Elara’s "live in reverie" line with atypical cadence for ghostly urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym loop in "crumbling leather trunk/yellowed, brittle letters"; final paragraph’s "lagoon calm once more" slightly overwrites but closure beat remains clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive archivist and debris communication; tropes transformed via obsidian lagoon’s tactile messaging, though zeppelin setting feels decorative rather than essential to the premise.</comment>
