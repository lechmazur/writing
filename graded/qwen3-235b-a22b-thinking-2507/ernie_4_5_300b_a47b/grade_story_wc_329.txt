<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interior contradiction under peak pressure lacks specificity; "resonantly soft" remains abstract label without embodied tradeoffs during climax. Micro-choices (pressing shell to fissure) reveal values but emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution in final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "absence left room for something wilder" crystallizes the conceptual price of control. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (music intensifying) and cadence shift (violin to shell), reweighting mechanized order with felt cost in crumbling statues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices (eastern wall limit, metallic fruit) and charges closure: trees weeping honey-scented sap mirrors Lira's emotional release. Locust shell functions as micro-setting, its iridescence charging the final image when "spinning like a fallen star."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: violin-to-shell shift narrows options with visible cost (snapped string, bleeding fingers). Stakes tighten through music's intensification, culminating in the geyser eruption that reconfigures the dominant stake—mechanized order versus wild magic—with statues' empty sockets as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: metal-tasting peaches and humming grass reweight "breaking free" as trusting chaos. Final image ("orchard listened. This time, it answered") resonates without moralizing, reframing control as illusion through sensory specifics rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peaches glowed like captured sunsets") modulates with pressure—diction compresses during climax ("She didn’t stop"). Purposeful elision (backstory fragment) pays off in eastern wall’s significance, though "resonantly soft" repetition slightly dilutes rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("resonantly soft" reappears without evolution) and scaffold in backstory paragraph ("orchard had once been..."). Final line’s "lullaby for the world" risks sentimentality but is anchored by "strings still humming," preserving propulsion through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-resistance trope via locust shell’s heart-rhythm signaling. "Tarnished wonder" tone avoids cliché through specific decay ("peaches tasted of metal"), though "gap between knowing/understanding" frame edges toward abstraction without sufficient causal tether.</comment>
