<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "silent scream of tenderness" hum—fear and hope coexist physically in her trembling chest. Micro-choices (stealing vial, specific whispered words) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (tears in rain). Thalos’ unexpected support avoids stock mentor tropes through lived-in details ("crinkling like parchment").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: villagers’ wordless reaction ("warmth in the air") crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (humming, scent, rain) not causal turns. Cost proof: "tears mixing with rain" + villagers’ physical tremors make emotional price visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: spiral stairs’ groans heighten tension, tower height enables vibration transmission to village. "Salt-kissed soil" garden directly charges closure—Thalos’ jasmine reprises Elara’s scent, merging with her hum to trigger villagers’ reaction. Occupational specificity ("oilskin coat," "lantern room") grounds stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens through Elara’s agency: her humming deepens intent’s physical manifestation (vial glow → sea churn → village impact). Thalos’ arrival tests commitment but his support reframes pressure—cost shifts from fear of ridicule to emotional vulnerability (tears). Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s choices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "proof was in the silence" crystallizes without moralizing. Villagers’ wordless reaction ("wife dropped her needle") offers resonant answer to "whispers vs shouts" via embodied cost. Avoids sentimentality—grief/love transmitted as physical warmth, not abstract epiphany. No thematic echo; closure reweights grandmother’s "relic" as communal truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles: dawn "bled gold into the bruised sky" filters through Elara’s emotional lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, tense sentences during Thalos’ approach ("She froze"), flowing cadence in hum ("low and slow"). Thalos’ dialogue ("current, not a wave") distinct in lexicon yet consistent with his keeper role. Zero filter verbs; psychic distance stays anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt and time" streaking tower exemplifies textural specificity. Sentence rhythm accelerates during climax ("vial cork glowed steady, a tiny beacon") then breathes in closure. "Silent scream of tenderness" risks purple prose but works contextually as Elara’s internal metaphor. Final line ("proof was in the silence") crystallizes theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional transmission via vibration physics avoids cliché. Thalos’ garden reprise transforms "whispers" from personal theory to communal phenomenon—specificity ("crushed lavender, moonflower, sweat") elevates trope. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off: villagers’ unexplained reaction proves stakes without exposition. Derivative guardrail cleared—no template echoes.</comment>
