<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—meticulous registrar vs. curious decoder—drive his choice to engage with the ticket stubs, culminating in earned renunciation of his mistrust. Lira’s line about honesty lands with embodied cost (“throat tightened”), avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Elias’s silent doodle reconfigures the forecourt’s hush from barrier to bridge, with felt cost in his abandoned logs. Accumulative lens holds as crystal vibrations and ticket markings intensify pressure toward crystallized stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-slicked crystals constrain choice (Elias follows their hum) and charge the final image (“gleamed like a promise”). Tool-as-setting elevates: the lens’s crack enables discovery, making closure’s doodle resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mistrust of silence) tightens via Elias’s agency: decoding the ticket narrows options to either dismissal or engagement. Cost—abandoning log-keeping for doodling—is legible in the final beat’s tangible shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through crystals’ hum and ticket codes, but “words were overrated” in penultimate paragraph violates organic emergence, bordering on thematic echo (-0.6 penalty) despite strong subtext elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices ticket curl and spectacles’ chill through registrar’s precision. Lira’s dialogue (“You’re late”) carries subtext via sparse rhythm, though “resonant hush” repetition slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density (“doodled a lens in the margin, a silent invitation”) propels momentum, but “cryptic doodles: spirals, broken lines” uses colon unnaturally for Elias’s voice, causing minor register drift in a key beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms communication tropes via ticket stubs as “keys,” avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though crystal forecourt leans slightly familiar without deeper world logic.</comment>
