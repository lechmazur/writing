<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (calloused hands, cold water) but lacks contradictory impulses; final acceptance isn't earned by struggle—flaws never complicate choices. "Before everything shifted" hint remains unexploited tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: notebook entry ("smallest things hold light") crystallizes cost of ritual labor under Accumulative lens. But escalation lacks density increase—ripples fade without meaningful pressure shift beyond passive observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory details are selective and purposeful (glistening nets, breath in mist), yet Pearl Bay remains postcard scenery. Prism charges final image but never constrains choices—fails 9+ gate for environment/tool actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in mundane) is signaled early but never concretized. Zero escalation: ritual works perfectly with no resistance, cost, or trade-offs. Peaceful resolution lacks visible price—stakes remain abstract despite strong thematic setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through prism/light motifs; final line avoids moralizing by rooting insight in lived experience ("quiet moments reveal deeper truths"). Notebook reprise charges closure without sentimentality—resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (glazier's light-focused noticing) with rhythmic control under pressure. "Water still as glass" refracting sky shows voice-motivated compression. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("commune with the world... commune with the bay") and thematic echo ("read between lines" repeated verbatim) dull momentum. Final paragraph slightly overwrites ("clear complexity"), but closure beat remains clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "beauty in ordinary" through glazier's lens feels specific, yet premise lacks bold risk—transformation test fails (swap "harbor glazier" for "painter" and story still works). Emotional truth is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>
