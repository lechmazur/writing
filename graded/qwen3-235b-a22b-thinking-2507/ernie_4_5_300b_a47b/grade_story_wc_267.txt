<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elric’s interior contradiction (silence as contract vs. virtue) drives micro-choices under pressure, but Lady Veyra lacks sufficient embodiment; her fury feels functional rather than fully realized. The cost of speaking—shattering his identity—is viscerally earned through the bolt’s weight and throat dryness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the child’s clumsy piano notes crystallize safety as active "garden" not cage, with conceptual cost (Elric’s role irrevocably changed) legible in "heart light with knowledge that some costs were worth paying." Orientation anchors by word 10; Accumulative lens holds through patterned object reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt constrains choice (neglect triggers crisis, tightening resolves it) and charges the final image ("polished and secure, gleamed"). Cobalt walls dim during Lady Veyra’s scream, proving setting pressure—not mere backdrop. Only minor deduction for "frozen mercury" bordering on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elric’s agency: neglecting the bolt (his choice) escalates to the "unpardonable silence," forcing him to confront silence as "contract." The cost—sacrificing his seraphic mundanity—is visible when he speaks, reconfiguring the fortress’s entire safety paradigm. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the wobbling bench (safety’s fragility) and child’s imperfect music (safety as garden). Avoids moralizing despite Elric’s line; the final image’s "lives mending, one note at a time" resonates without stating a moral. Slight over-explanation in "courage to listen" keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elric notices textures (moonlight-polished silverware, yellow staircase stain) reflecting his meticulousness. Rhythm shifts from hushed ("quiet as shadow’s breath") to resonant ("note so pure it seemed to melt snow"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "rusted and stubborn bolt required precise twist" shows rather than tells; "frostbitten hope" avoids sentimentality via concrete "thawed cobalt walls." Final paragraph’s "garden" metaphor integrates flawlessly with prior action (child’s music). Highest-band rarity for line-level control in short form.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "silent servant" trope through nerve-regeneration context and cobalt symbolism. The bolt’s physicality (rusted, warm in pocket) avoids abstract theme. "Frostbitten hope" crystallizes the concept memorably. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
