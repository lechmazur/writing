<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation lacks concrete stakes; "mild obsession" constrains action yet cost remains abstract (aching fingers vs. tangible sacrifice). Final smile lacks earned weight despite strong embodied details like trembling lips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands (map glowing in darkness), but cost proof fails—no exact line showing sacrifice. Fort’s groans and pebble showers intensify pressure under Accumulative lens, yet shedding gold flakes reads as positive imperfection, not visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: wind rattles archway mid-sketch, pebbles interrupt work, mortar cracks guide tracing. Final image charged as map light "seeps into cracks," transforming fort—environment directly shapes closure per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping silence) signaled early, but escalation lacks tightening. Fort’s groans and residual tension deepen atmosphere yet don’t narrow options or raise cost meaningfully. No visible price paid (ink vial unused, quill intact) weakens Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "silence between heartbeats" squiggle answers "can silence be mapped?" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise—map as "moments" (pre-decision hush) offers resonant, non-literal closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice distinct under pressure: "stone teeth gnawing at wind" compresses tension, lexicon ("palimpsest of echoes") feels earned. No head-hopping; "marbled hush" reframes early motif at closure. Rhythmic control peaks as sentences shorten during deepening ambered hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal artifacts, though "mild obsession" repetition creates subtle loop. Figurative language serves pressure ("undulating like wave’s crest"), but "symbols dissolved when stared at too long" slightly overwrites. Closure lines immaculate: "silence would wait... for next oracle."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "mapmaker" trope via sensory innovation: silence mapped through inked hushes. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual map) heightens stakes—pebble shore oracle specificity avoids cliché. Fresh inflection: "endless night" as "labyrinth between breaths" grows from prior particulars.</comment>
