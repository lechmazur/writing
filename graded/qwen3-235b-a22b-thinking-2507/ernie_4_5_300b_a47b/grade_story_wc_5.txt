<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; patience demonstrated physically but not psychologically tested. Epiphany about "translating heartbeats" feels unearned without struggle against impatience during the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with starlight surge, but cost remains abstract ("chest heaving" insufficient). Liquid silver vial appears deus ex machina, weakening causal chain in pivotal sealing moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orchard debris (twigs/apple shells) concretely constrains sealing method and charges final image. Cold's sensory impact ("fingers ached") directly alters tactics during ritual execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes declared ("fickle" starlight) but never concretely tested during ritual; third attempt succeeds without escalation. Dominant stake lacks visible price beyond physical discomfort, failing cost legibility required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("how to feel, how to listen") explicitly states the thesis, violating organic emergence. Conceptual repricing of starlight as "guide to the heart" lacks prior groundwork for resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory filtering (cold sharpening senses), but "breath hung in the air" repetition creates scaffold. Rhythmic control during sealing ritual exemplifies pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"He began by arranging... The branches came next... Finally..." creates template cadence in critical beat. Zero figurative muddle in peak moments, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("dead trees creaked but did not break") trigger minor deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and cartography through "flash-paper" specificity, but "safekept starlight" trope remains under-transformed. Emotional truth in ritual focus compensates for familiar premise, though cost specificity lacks.</comment>
