<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation ("forgive the unfinished") remains abstract despite strong embodied emotion; lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal blood-pricking moment that would elevate to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "rust-colored stain that pulsed faintly" crystallizes conceptual cost with aurora's light washing over her; Accumulative lens holds through stalactite drips tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (rose thorn) constrains choice (blood seal) and charges final image; sanctuary atmosphere pressures through stalactite clock but marble walls don't actively shape tactics beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density: aurora hues shifting across hands, dripping stalactites as temporal pressure, and blood-stain pulse deepen stakes; cost unmistakable in "pulsed faintly" as conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (blood seal, spiral cipher), not abstraction; final image ("echo of her purpose") resonantly answers "calibrated treason" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "stalactites dripping like liquid time" filters urgency through forger's precision; rhythmic control modulates with emotional intensity ("tasting of iron and regret").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor register drift in "tasting of iron and regret" borders on therapy-speak but avoids full penalty due to contextual integration within peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" reframes forgery as forgiveness with fresh moral calculus; rose thorn's curse ("remembered every wound") transforms cliché into indispensable emotional engine.</comment>
