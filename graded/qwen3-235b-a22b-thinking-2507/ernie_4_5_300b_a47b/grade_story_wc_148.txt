<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's "I'm not lying" vs "tasted like ash" moment; embodied emotion through lattice grip and hovering. Final choice to write rather than run earns endurance with visible cost in the reef's "jagged maw."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Elias declares "I'm writing," reconfiguring "chasing hush" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through copperlight's evolution; cost legible in dissolving walls revealing the unfound bodies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lattice functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—clinking metals become a bell tolling in reverse. Copperlight repose constrains choice by enabling hovering while embodying emotional state, perfectly charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("chasing hush") tightens through Elias's agency: rejecting the figure's "outrun the story" with "I'm writing" forecloses escape. Cost is visceral in the reef's "jagged maw" view, reweighting the prelude with unavoidable consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ending's "found himself" reweights "chasing hush" without moralizing—truth emerges from lattices as pens, not platitudes. Theme of inherited lies vs self-authored truth resonates through concrete actions (clinking metals, hovering) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "scuffs gnawing like teeth" and "sound like wind through a keyhole." Rhythmic control peaks in closure beats: "I'm not running. I'm writing" compresses emotional weight without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issues in "vines of light creeping" beat slightly blur immediacy. Otherwise, zero loops; "copperlight repose" evolves with purpose. Final line’s "silent and proud" ghost crystallizes cost without telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lighthouse ghost story" via lattice-as-pen metaphor. Risk-taking heightens stakes—hovering isn’t magical escape but embodied commitment to truth-telling. Emotional specificity in "one gold, one silver" eyes avoids trope.</comment>
