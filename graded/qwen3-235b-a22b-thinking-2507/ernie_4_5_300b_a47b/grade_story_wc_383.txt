<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "beauty that hurt to look at" versus archived failures; final choice to repurpose pain earned through visceral micro-choices like arranging shell fragments. Slight deduction for "archived every failure" abstraction in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "roses reduced to ash" crystallizes cost of shedding isolation while "constellations of light" reconfigures memory's meaning. Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to the shell-circle climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden functions as active constraint—velvet petals breathing, skeletal stems revealed—and charges closure through ash imagery. "Dirt under her knees" tactilely grounds choices while twilight-to-dawn shift mirrors internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: arranging shells forces memory confrontation. Cost is visceral in garden's destruction and "burning but not hurting" sparks. Minor deduction as isolation-to-independence shift lacks granular tactical tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"jars labeled 'lesson'"—with final image of "constellations of light" answering "Why does everyone leave?" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via ash-and-sparks duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "petals as soft as mourning veils"; rhythm accelerates during memory surge ("The memory hit her like a physical blow"). Slight register drift in "resonance structures" momentarily jars established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, but "lock[ing] her heart" metaphor slightly clichéd in opening. Final paragraph's "ordinary and unyielding" avoids overwriting while "ghostly resolve" earns its lyricism through prior setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine trope via specific sensory alchemy (lavender soap scent, velvet petals shedding color). Emotional truth in "archiving pain" avoids safety middle, though "skeletal stems" risks over-familiarity without deeper world logic.</comment>
