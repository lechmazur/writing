<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but thin on contradictory impulses; "cool-headed" trait shown via actions yet emotional progression overly tidy without visible flaws complicating choices. Micro-choices align with motives but lack hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with legible cost ("the cost was clear... essence seeping into soil") under Accumulative lens. Pattern breaks escalate density, though lens not named by midpoint weakens high-band eligibility despite coherent pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active constraint: moss flickering alters tactics, rail spike as micro-setting charges final image ("soil shimmered faintly"). Environment directly shapes climax and closure without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via pattern breaks (dissonant zigzag → fractured notes), but escalation leans on predetermined ritual ("if he voiced the right silence") rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Cost legible yet tactical shifts feel less earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tear-shaped constellation and "pure, clear tone" reweighting loss as necessary order; avoids moralizing while charging final image with conceptual cost. Resonant answer to "breaking patterns" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers tracing rail spike") with rhythmic control, but "sorrow so profound it threatened to unravel composure" edges toward therapy-speak, narrowly missing 9+ threshold despite strong pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density except "grief, longing, and a strange, feral hope" using label-only emotions in peak beat. Minor artifact prevents 9+ but closure beat remains sharp with "single note echoed... lingered like memory" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: rail spike as conductor, constellations as emotional barometers. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes ("feral lullaby" modulating to pure tone) without obscuring closure.</comment>
