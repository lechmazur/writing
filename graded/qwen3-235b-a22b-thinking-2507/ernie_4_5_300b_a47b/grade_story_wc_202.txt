<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Lira’s professional role clashing with personal memory resonance; embodied choices (hand pressed to crack) earn closure with palpable cost in "cool and heavy in her grip." Final renunciation of brute force feels inevitable through prior sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the fragment’s weight embodies "history that could be mended," reconfiguring stakes through Accumulative lens. Sensory escalation ("dust motes spelled a forgotten language") tightens pressure without causal breaks; cost legible in "comfort, a reminder" amid fractured histories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse mural constrains Lira’s pivotal action (tilting head to reveal door) and charges the final image ("beam now a steady pulse"). Micro-setting functions as environment: waves mirroring breath rhythm directly enables unfastening, avoiding static description through active pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through intuition-driven escalation (ink revealing hyper-detail), but lacks one visible price paid during attempts; tension remains conceptual. Agency shines via Lira’s sensory choices narrowing options, though the single deepening beat (mural shift) slightly under-escalates for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "anchors of intuition" reframed at closure ("for letting go"), avoiding moralizing. Final image—"threads connecting past and present"—resonantly answers the central question without abstraction, though "lesson lingered" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors bled into hyper-detail") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control varies from staccato action ("She pressed her hand") to flowing reflection. Zero head-hopping; elision (ink’s effect) taught early and paid off in mural revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("dust motes swirling... spelled a forgotten language" advances plot and theme). Minor metaphor muddle in "edges sharp yet soft, like a thought half-formed" during climax deducts 0.1, but clarity remains intact for closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes familiar tropes through specific lived detail: "anchors of intuition" transforms memory recovery into tactile stakes. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens coherence, though the "drowned world" backstory lacks one fresh inflection to reach 9.5+.</comment>
