<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (forgotten joy vs. restless hope), embodied via "fingers itch" and "breath catch" when Marla identifies her mother. Final choice earned through prior causality, though epiphany edges toward tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: fog thins "as if embarrassed" by life's resurgence, with visible cost in Lira's shift from requiem to resurrection. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation to the violin's hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting constraint—Lira's light-paintings directly combat its "monopoly on memory," charging the final image where it "seemed to thin." Selective sensory details (moss-choked paths, stolen sunbeam) avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (joy vs. fog's silence) tightens through protagonist agency: her display transforms elegy into communal resurrection. Cost crystallizes when children's giggles "pierce the silence," reconfiguring the orchard's very identity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "orchard wasn't lost anymore... in laughter of a fresco fragment." Final image reweights premise without moralizing; complexity in joy as "stubborn, glorious" yet born from loss avoids false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "fog clung like second skin," "light-words hover like fireflies." Rhythmic control modulates perfectly from lyrical setup to urgent climax ("Marla danced, her feet barely touching ground").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density throughout ("prisms, mirrors, stolen sunbeam" does triple duty). Final line "Everything" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies organically with scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: joy as "pensive mirth" via light-art in fog-bound orchard. Specificity transforms tropes ("peaches tasted like sunshine" grounds universality). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds without causal beats.</comment>
