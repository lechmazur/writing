<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (climbing, accepting hairpin), but Elara’s merchant resolution lacks character-particular motivation, slightly weakening the trust arc’s causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (fragile trust, "knees trembled"), but merchant coincidence slightly undermines causal escalation; lens (Hybrid, Accumulative-dominant) holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto’s mist/clouds constrain choices (climbing perch, shell discovery), charging the final image; "vineyard hush" evolves from setting to thematic texture, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (contentment via rebirth cycle) tighten through Lirael’s choices, but merchant’s guilt-driven return feels convenient, slightly diluting the earned cost of trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from hairpin/shell motifs; "contentment is a practice" resonates without moralizing, reweighting rebirth as active choice in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice distinct ("bark rough and familiar"), but Elara’s dialogue lacks idiom differentiation; "scallop their edges" metaphor risks over-articulation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose lyrical yet precise ("clouds pooled like liquid silver"), but "mossy nook where branches forked like outstretched arms" slightly overwrites, muddling momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness trope through grotto’s rebirth cycle; "scallop" as renewal symbol feels fresh, though merchant resolution leans derivative. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
