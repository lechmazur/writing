<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (gambler vs responsible daughter) act simultaneously in tracing the chalk outline; final choice to visit father earned by causal chain of lantern-light interpretation. Slight thematic echo in "contradictions are mirrors" borders on prompt-like language but saved by embodied cost (tears mixing with rain).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost (tears on cheeks reweighting "old regrets"); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in subway-car scribbles. Rain-tapped Morse code early pays off in final atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica-pane lantern constrains choices at fork (warping light to interpret "time bends") and charges final image; library's shifting floors supply micro-setting pressure. Rainwashed specificity ("silver-streaked windows") mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when lantern heat warps scrawls into actionable choice ("left at fork where time bends"), forcing trade-off between paths with visceral cost in tears. Pressure grows through Clara's agency interpreting scribbles, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through mica-pane light distortion reweighting "The past is a coin you can’t spend" at climax; avoids moralizing via concrete image (tears mixing with rain). "Contradictions are mirrors" risks thematic echo but gains legitimacy through Ms. Greer's voice and physical cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: math metaphors ("ledger she couldn’t balance") persist under stress; rhythm accelerates at fork choice with clipped syntax. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during subway-car lurch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "mica pane flickering" to "lantern’s flame danced" shows evolving use without redundancy. Minor synonym churn in "damp paper and old regrets" → "ozone and iron" slightly dilutes momentum but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory and magic realism via math-grounded contradictions; "rainwashed library" specificity avoids genre clichés. Risk-taking with conceptual closure (Charged Poise) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
