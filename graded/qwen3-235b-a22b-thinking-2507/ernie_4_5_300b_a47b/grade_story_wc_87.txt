<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "gravitating toward safety" versus discarding the compass, with embodied emotion in "merely melancholic" laughter and pulse-mirroring needle tremor. Final choice earned through micro-choices like reinterpreting poles as "human stubbornness," avoiding over-tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; regret manifests through concrete compass scratches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: abandoning the compass ("placed it on the railing") crystallizes stance with visible cost of forsaking safety nets. Accumulative lens holds—regret deepens from direction-finder to tide metaphor, tightening options toward "done hiding." Cost proof undeniable in final image of paddling south without looking back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: shifting shadows create disorientation, then align as "human stubbornness" markers guiding her south. Final image reweights poles through thematic lens without overt symbolism. Sensory details selective and urgency-appropriate ("tide pooling like liquid mercury" amid crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("regrets had shattered" her navigation), deepening through compass reinterpretation into "tide pulling her back." One meaningful intensification: needle pointing to horizon reconfigures regret’s meaning, narrowing options to "done hiding" with visible cost—abandoning the compass. Agency-driven under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: regret as measurable tide ("backlash of regrets... ocean’s way of reminding her alive"), not abstraction. Final image reweights grandpa’s "world bends" line into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (compass placement) and silence (no ex’s voice), avoiding thematic echo despite grandpa’s advice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: navigator’s eye notices "utility poles as land’s bones" and "sextant’s edge" voice. Rhythmic control under pressure—lyrical during reflection, sparse at climax ("She stood. She placed..."). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during lighthouse climb. Voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in peak beats ("Each scratch... a choice she’d second-guessed"). Figurative language precise ("waves slapping hull like metronome") without muddle. Final line crystallizes theme through concrete image ("backlash of regrets... ocean’s way"), avoiding abstraction. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trope transformed through specific navigator lens: regret measured via compass mechanics, not abstract burden. Fresh inflection in poles shifting from guides to "human stubbornness" markers. Emotional truth in "gravitating toward safety" contradiction; risk-taking with quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
