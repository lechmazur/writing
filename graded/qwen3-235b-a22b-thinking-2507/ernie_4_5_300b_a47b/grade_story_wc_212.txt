<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "furiously tranquil" remains label without sufficient embodied contradiction. Internal conflict alternates rather than coexists in key beats. Final choice earned yet lacks visceral tradeoff during the vortex dive climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("diamond dust" shattering implies unstable renewal). Orientation solid by line 3. Vortex mechanics slightly convenient—"introduce disorder to decrease entropy" lacks dramatized test of the paradox.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains action (roots digging into ice) and charges final image (sapling amid melting ice/diamond dust). Micro-setting (acorn cap) functions as essential tool. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopening path) tightens with egg hatching, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening under accumulative lens. "Decrease entropy" mechanic told not tested—no visible price paid during seed scattering that alters later tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gritty yet smooth" texture metaphor resolving in sapling/diamond dust image. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "borrowed time" without stating a moral. Slight tell in "paradox she’d always known" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky like shattered glass," "wings like fractured mirrors") with rhythmic control. "Furiously tranquil" edges toward label-speak in high-pressure beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during vortex dive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density issue in climax: "gritty like sand... smooth like water" creates mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but "shattering into diamond dust" slightly overwrites closure image. Propulsion strong despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving mysticism with entropy physics avoids derivative vortex tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes ("decrease entropy via disorder"), but conceptual clarity prevents gimmickry. Transformation test passed—fails with generic "magic artifact."</comment>
