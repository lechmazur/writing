<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s spy-trained paranoia versus her need to trust, but professional spy traits don’t concretely shape tactics (e.g., no fieldcraft detail altering her transcription method), slightly weakening causality for her shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("facing parts of herself she’d buried") under Accumulative lens; density peaks as ink bleeds into earth, reweighting "unused courage" with emotional price. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting: muffled footsteps enable secrecy (constraining choice), while the bluff’s void mirrors her uncertainty, charging the final image where mist parts for sunlight—environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mara transcribes despite paranoia, narrowing options to "trust or remain broken," but external spy networks feel secondary; cost is legible in her self-confrontation, though pressure leans heavily internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unused courage" emerges through concrete acts (deciphering, transcribing), not abstraction; final image ("courage to seek it") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (spy noticing "silence between heartbeats") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, but "prudently daring" briefly drifts into academic diction, slightly disrupting voice coherence during high-stakes action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mist clinging like a second skin" shows textural specificity without muddle. One near-overwritten beat ("codes in accumulated snow—meltwater...") avoids penalty via payoff in thematic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through emotional specificity (courage as "flame to rekindle"), but weather station resolution leans familiar; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
