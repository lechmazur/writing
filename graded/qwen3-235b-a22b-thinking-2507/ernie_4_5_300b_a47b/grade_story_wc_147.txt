<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in vial-stopper resistance vs patience, but lullaby memory lacks prior setup, weakening epiphany's earnedness despite strong embodied stress reactions like "breath fogged the glass."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost (abandoning capture for release), yet storm threat remains abstract pressure rather than tightening tactics—cost legible in "lonesome splendor" final image but escalation lacks causal teeth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple as micro-setting constrains every choice: algae-slick stone impedes grip, fissure demands physical sacrifice, and the vial's final "empty but radiant" state charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness vs release ephemeral) tightens through scent-triggered memories, but storm deadline fails as concrete pressure—it's declared but never alters tactics beyond generic time pressure, weakening escalation's impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from vial's action: "unsnarled, not held" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing, reweighting the entire premise through the radiant emptiness of release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in "lavender and saltwater" sensory bias, though "weight of a crown" momentarily slips into authorial intrusion, disrupting Mara's plausible knowledge during high-stress memory surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose avoids fatal loops but "hush" repetition (5x in climax) creates subtle redundancy; final image ("lonesome splendor of release") achieves crystalline propulsion despite minor cadence drag in memory sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-prison trope through "gathered hush" physicality; risk-taking in lyric structure pays off via vial's irreversible transformation, avoiding derivative safety with tangible emotional cost.</comment>
