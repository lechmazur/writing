<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "forgiving himself" backstory lacks on-page tension during rope-weaving climax. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack hierarchy (e.g., no trade-off between speed/accuracy). Embodied emotion strong via trembling hands and raw skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: names burning brighter reconfigures stakes with visible cost (raw hands, enduring silence). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; aurora-to-vortex escalation narrows options. Orientation flawless by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum constrains every choice (frost-hidden mechanism, creaking ice pressure). Rope’s braids function as micro-setting charging closure—indigo void thread reconfigures into Lira’s voice. Sensory specificity ("snowmelt and iron") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving erased voices) tighten through rope’s resistance and snapping threads. One meaningful escalation: light coalescing into beam forces crystallization. Cost legible via "hands raw but steady" and names burning brighter—conceptual price of memory’s fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope’s reweaving, not moralizing. Final image ("names burned brighter, each one a note") resonates non-literally with "sound of forgotten names" premise. Avoids sentimentality by embedding cost in tactile details (raw hands, frayed card).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "technically gentle" fingers tracing perforations, aurora’s "green-gold veils." Rhythmic control peaks in closure ("rope’s glow faded, but the names... burned brighter"). Zero head-hopping; frost-hidden mechanism taught early for elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "faintly, then brighter" avoids paraphrase via kinetic escalation. "Memory was a braid of light and shadow" risks abstraction but redeemed by rope’s physical reweaving. Final line’s cadence shift ("illuminated the past, not with fire, but with light") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transmutes "lost wax caster" trope through icebound ritual—metal replaced by light reconfiguration. Emotional truth in preserving erased voices via braided rope, not sentimental flashback. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
