<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "courageous anomaly" manifests through embodied micro-choices (e.g., merging reflections while ice cracks), avoiding stock phrasing. Final endurance earns cost via transformed storm, though "calmly intuitive" borders on label without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: ice stilled but aurora's approval implies fragile victory. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (sailor/mother/lover glimpses), though "weighted breath" vagueness slightly weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-laden apple trees and shifting ice floes actively constrain choices (e.g., boots crunching frozen wood during ascent). Recurring crystal fragment charges final image by mending cracks with "light of shared humanity," meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear vs empathy) tightens through protagonist agency—Elara's weaving transforms terror into resilience. Cost is legible in ice floes stilling, but escalation lacks visceral felt-price depth despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mended crystal fragment reweights "courage" as action amid fear. Avoids moralizing via final image, though "courage wasn't absence of fear" risks proximity to thematic echo without stronger subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dark as midnight ice, flickered with quiet fire") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control excels in attic sequence, though "shadow-laced peacekeeper" slightly overreaches lexicon during calm reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("ice groaned beneath lighthouse’s foundation"), but "weighted breath before reply" creates abstract loop. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, though minor scaffold in reflection ("years too close to aurora’s glow").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy mapping via salvaged mirrors transforms lighthouse trope. Emotional specificity in sailor/mother/lover glimpses avoids genericity, though "courageous anomaly" risks familiar framing without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
