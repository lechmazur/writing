<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs curiosity) drive the tooth-placement climax with embodied cost (trembling hand). Elias’s grief-lined face and their history (“hole in her filled with questions”) make the renunciation of pure skepticism feel earned without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: fountain’s renewed flow crystallizes “cleft in certainty closed” with conceptual cost (Elias’s sacrifice, Mara’s shattered worldview). Hybrid lens holds—causal tooth placement triggers accumulative shift in meaning, with pressure tightening via Elias’s revelation (“It’s a bridge, but not to the fae”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The changeling’s tooth (micro-setting) actively constrains choice—Mara repurposes bone-setting tools to “realign” the garden’s magic. Final flowing water charges closure, transforming the moss-choked fountain from symbol of decay to renewal while reflecting Mara’s internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elias reveals the tooth’s true cost (“sacrifice. A piece of yourself”), forcing Mara’s agency-driven choice to place both teeth. The tremor in her hand and Elias’s aged face manifest visceral cost, narrowing options to acceptance—a moral calculus between truth-seeking and personal loss that forecloses skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through earned particulars: “mistakes are constellations” evolves into “broken things could be mended” without moralizing. Final line (“garden’s not a trick—it’s a mirror”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo by rooting insight in Mara’s physical act of placing the teeth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices “thorns as if testing reality,” hears hedges “hum with whispers.” Rhythm modulates under pressure—terse dialogue during confrontation (“Mara’s throat tightened”) contrasts lyrical closure (“sunlight breaking through clouds”). Zero head-hopping; Elias’s voice (“You still think you can outsmart the garden?”) carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels story: “jagged edge cut her thumb” shows trauma, “fountain’s water began to flow again” crystallizes closure. Figurative language sparse but potent (“mistakes are constellations”); final image avoids muddle while charging theme. No artifacts in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: changeling myth transformed via “cleft in certainty” as psychological rift, not supernatural trick. Risk-taking in Earned Stasis closure (no magical showdown) heightens stakes—Mara’s quiet realization mends the garden through acceptance, avoiding genre clichés while feeling inevitable.</comment>
