<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's "rationally rebellious" motivation manifests in concrete micro-choices (clutching cog, redefining agony) with embodied contradiction—his intellectual passion wars with sewer-dwelling reality. Mara's pressure crystallizes his endurance, but "ache of understanding" borders on diagnostic label-speak, costing 0.2.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (bleeding hands, societal rejection) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Sediment digging deepens the dominant stake, but lens ambiguity mid-story (-0.3) slightly weakens causality coherence despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (aligning with needle) and charging the final image. Sensory details ("algae-choked water," "rust") are purpose-driven and filtered through Elias's salvage-obsessed POV, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (preserving ancient navigation) tightens through sediment digging, narrowing options to physical endurance. Cost (bleeding hands) is visible but under-explored emotionally; escalation leans textural over causal, lacking a decisive trade-off at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the astrolabe moment—"nourishes" vs "feeds"—avoiding moralizing. Final line ("finally felt… understood") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, but "thousand narratives" risks thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice carries Elias's perceptual signature ("putrid perfume," "razor wrapped in silk"), with dialogue showing status dynamics (Mara's gravel-laughter vs Elias's abrasive calm). Minor filter verbs ("he believed") are voice-motivated, but tension peaks lack syntactic compression under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Scribbling treatises... scribbling" creates a paraphrase loop; "agony redefined" feels overwritten. Final image suffers slight muddiness from "thousand narratives" abstraction, but rhythm generally propels without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague narrative through sedimentary archaeology and navigation tools avoids cliché. Emotional specificity (Elias's rare smile) elevates tropes, but risks minor derivative echoes of post-apocalyptic "lone philosopher" archetypes without transformative risk.</comment>
