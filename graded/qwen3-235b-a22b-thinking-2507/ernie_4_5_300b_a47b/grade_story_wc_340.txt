<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) drive micro-choices under pressure, but the widow’s sudden emotional shift lacks sufficient buildup; embodied grief (“porcelain mask cracking”) elevates interiority beyond labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara steps onto the tenth floor with diary/goggles, cost legible in the widow’s trembling hands and “wind through frozen pines” laugh; accumulative lens holds via sensory density increase (ice veins revealed) and pattern break (symbols unfolding).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire functions as active constraint—goggles (tool) charge the final image, while ice veins literally reconfigure Mara’s perception; micro-setting details (“frosted glass,” “cracked lenses”) avoid postcard description by altering tactics during revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara’s agency: adjusting goggles narrows options by revealing hidden ice patterns, forcing confrontation with the widow; escalation culminates in the symbols’ unfolding, with cost visible in the widow’s shattered detachment (“hands shook as she took them”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects (diary’s phoenix symbol, flickering flame), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights “joy beneath anguish” via Mara’s “I ascend” commitment, with the widow’s laugh embodying earned complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“dust sparkled like starlight,” “breath fogging the glass”) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shines in sparse, visceral syntax during high-stakes beats (“Mara’s chest tightened”), with no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“gears grinding like a tired heart” conveys sound, motion, metaphor); final line (“a flame flickered. She’d find it”) crystallizes closure without figurative muddle or momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific icebound logic: cracked goggles reconfigure truth-seeking, while “joy/anguish twins” avoids sentimentality through visceral stakes; emotional specificity (“wind through frozen pines” laugh) elevates beyond generic grief narratives.</comment>
