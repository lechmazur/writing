<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (selling jars while unsettled by the man), but secondary character lacks depth; Earned Stasis closure with visible cost ("grateful for the absence") lands cleanly within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of untold stories"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held consistently; no causality breaks despite subtle escalation through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric specificity ("prismatic shards," "mist-muffled footsteps") charges final image, but setting fails 9+ gate by not constraining choices—glass orchard remains decorative rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("glimmering parole" reweighted by the note's return), but escalation lacks visible trade-offs; felt cost ("grateful for the absence") suffices for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (residue swirl, unattached note), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "beginnings" with earned resonance, though "she understood" slightly edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing absences, light refractions) and rhythmic control evident, but minor filter-verb clusters ("she could not shake") dilute immediacy in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("parole of unwritten narratives"); only "mind racing" slips into generality, redeemed by subsequent concrete action ("residue swirled like stardust").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bottled magic" trope through absence-as-commodity, but "man in shadow" verges on familiar archetype; emotional specificity in creator's anxiety elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
