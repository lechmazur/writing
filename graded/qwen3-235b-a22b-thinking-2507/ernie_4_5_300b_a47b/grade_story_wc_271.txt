<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied contradictions (trembling hands freezing deliberately) and micro-choices (palming stone to resist flashback). Mrs. Voss’s ship-counting backstory slightly strains plausibility but serves thematic pressure without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lila’s "steps light" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (hope’s fragility). Accumulative escalation via sensory density (wind gust → flashback → lavender anchor) reweights grief without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stone bench and lavender function as micro-setting, constraining choices (palming rock to freeze panic) and charging the final image ("cradled in her chest"). Salt-bleached roses and wind-twisted pines avoid symbolism by actively shaping her somatic practice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief as void vs. shape) tightens through the wind-triggered flashback, forcing Lila’s somatic choice with visible cost (fragile hope). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens lacks one nuanced intensification in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "pearl of stillness" reweights from escape to lens in the final realization. Mrs. Voss’s "anchor hope in realism" risks thematic echo but stays grounded in stone/salt, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature shines in stress ("ears ringing, Elias’s blood on her dress" vs. calm "humming their song"). Rhythmic control during the flashback (short staccato phrases) modulates perfectly with pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-bleached roses claimed the stone paths" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "quietly talented hands" (abstract descriptor) slightly dilutes embodied immediacy in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Somatic markers transform PTSD tropes through specific, credible practice (lavender petal texture vs. generic therapy). Emotional freshness in "love lived in hummed songs" avoids sentimental symmetry, though Mrs. Voss edges toward mentor archetype.</comment>
