<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied apology (“words raw”) reveals contradictory impulses (blame vs longing) under pressure; Yorick’s micro-choices in stitching directly alter tactics with visible cost (years of silence confronted). Interiority avoids therapy-speak through tactile lace metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Lira’s apology and the ghost’s response crystallize stance with felt cost (erased years), while the calm sea reconfigures the severance myth. Accumulative lens holds—each lace stitch deepens emotional pressure, narrowing options toward forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tarnished compass and lace pattern function as micro-setting, constraining choices (stitch sequence dictates emotional progression) and charging the final image (glowing lace on calm sea). Sensory details (“wet kelp,” “cerulean bruise”) filter through Yorick’s bonsai-tender priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through lace stitches: acknowledgment → admission → forgiveness narrows options under Accumulative lens. Lira’s trembling-to-raw apology shows escalating agency; cost (years of blame) is visible in her “hitched breath” and the ghost’s flickering form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace-as-language motif: “tides of remembrance” reweights severance as a “door,” not a wall. Final image (calm sea reflecting rain-washed sky) resonates without moralizing, charging prior grief with earned peace through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yorick’s voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (“calloused thumb,” “rhythm of roots”) with rhythmic control (“slow as melting snow”). Lace metaphors modulate under pressure; no POV leakage despite dual characters. Dialogue indirection (“find the color of what my father never said”) carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density (“compass’s needle spun lazily, as if caught between currents”). Minor register drift: “Diffuse the tides” risks academic diction but is justified by Yorick’s expertise. Final line (“rhythm of tides—not of water, but of hearts”) avoids sentimentality through concrete reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-reunion trope via lace-stitch emotional logic. “Tides of remembrance” premise gains freshness through bonsai-master lens and tactile execution. Risk-taking (lace as memory guide) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the severance myth feels specific to Marrow’s End.</comment>
