<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s clenched hands versus crumpled face during confession; embodied emotion (“breath fogging the chamber’s glass”) avoids therapy-speak. Elias’s micro-choice to weave starlight after truth admission earns closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: stone’s “flicker of gold” amid gloom when Lira admits her husband’s lie, reconfiguring truth’s weight. Accumulative lens holds through resonant density shifts, though minor causality softness in Elias’s diagnosis slightly blurs agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains every choice—vibrating walls amplify adjustments, dust shakes during climax. Copper grooves and liquid silence charge the final image, transforming setting into active pressure rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s confession as the sole meaningful escalation, narrowing options to truth or silence. Cost is felt in her “crumpled” face and the stone’s flare, but Elias’s prompt (“you must admit”) slightly dilutes protagonist agency in the pivotal turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: “covenant of rust” etched on the door becomes earned wisdom via the box’s unraveling. Final image (“tether between past and present”) reweights grief without moralizing, though covenant’s creed risks near-thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature (“air shimmered with residual sound”) reflects Elias’s trade, with rhythmic control tightening under pressure. No head-hopping; syntax compresses during high-stakes weaving (“needle into mainspring, guiding it through gears”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; “syrup of sound” risks mixed metaphor but pays off as patterned textural density. Final line (“mended not what was torn”) achieves crystalline propulsion, though “glass weep” edges toward cliché without full reinvention.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Rust covenant” transforms trope through specific mechanics (tethering via starlight threads). Emotional truth in Lira’s debt admission avoids generic grief; fresh synthesis of philosopher’s stone as moral mirror feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
