<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (outrunning time vs. feeling weight of unwritten lines) drive micro-choices like untying knots, with embodied cost in "throat tightened" and "breath caught." "Ethically playful" trait lacks sufficient pressure-testing beyond initial laugh, slightly weakening flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the rope's spiral reveals time's "texture" through patterns with undeniable cost ("weight of unwritten lines" made visceral). Accumulative lens holds throughout with density building toward the grotto's wall transformation and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure: clay walls peeling to constellations directly mirrors the rope's unraveling, constraining Kael's choice. Sensory details like "vibrations of forgotten footsteps" are POV-filtered and pressure the thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency in untying knots—each memory release narrows options toward the spiral's revelation. Cost is legible in "weight of unwritten lines," though the timeframe ("after beings arrive") lacks live-clock pressure that would elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rope motif: abandoned poems as "loose threads," roads as "knots untied." Final line reweights time as patterns without moralizing, but "texture of time" risks thematic echo though saved by being's voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poet's perceptual signature shines ("clay like ancient skin," "swirls of light pulsing"). Minor register drift in "ethically playful" label, but compression ("dusk... abandoned road... grotto") and stress-modulated syntax ("Kael hesitated. The rope was...") demonstrate masterful control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "rusted compass" does triple duty (character, setting, symbol). Sentences vary rhythm ("He unrolled the frayed rope...") while avoiding overwriting. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete image ("spiral" with "unbroken thread").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "poet meets mystic" trope via prison rope as choice-map. Emotional truth in creators' fear of abandoned work ("verse you abandon is a thread left loose") feels specific, not generic. Risk-taking in conceptual closure pays off through prior particulars.</comment>
