<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anya's embodied motivation (mentor's death) and micro-choices (adjusting sensors) ground her interiority, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond professional duty. The engineer's abrupt appearance strains character causality despite strong sensory reactions to the patch's vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("some machines never truly sleep"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through wind-pattern density. However, the engineer's sudden appearance strains causality, slightly undermining the pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth actively constrains choices (rusted ridges for climbing) and charges the final image—the wind vortices aren't backdrop but the story's engine. Micro-setting (the vibrating patch) directly alters tactics and crystallizes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through wind intensification (45mph gusts) driven by Anya's agency (climbing, data cross-referencing), with visceral cost in the final realization. But the engineer's discovery relies slightly on coincidence rather than pure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the port's "hunger" reweights the premise without moralizing. The final image ("patch still warm") delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of technological convergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical details ("airspeed and direction," sodium-lit patch), but filter verbs ("she felt his presence") slightly distance us during high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively from clinical to uncanny.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity ("salt-stained gravel"), but "rapidly adapting mind raced" tells rather than shows. Minor synonym churn ("labyrinth," "puzzle box") in early beats slightly dulls propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms drone-crash tropes via the container-wind vortex premise, with authentic occupational details preventing abstraction. Risk-taking (port as sentient machine) heightens stakes coherently, though not radically innovative.</comment>
