<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (skepticism vs belief) through embodied details like "breath caught" and "chill down spine"; micro-choices (tracing seal, swallowing) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("dust rained from rafters," "teeth ache") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the library's shudder reconfigures meaning through patterned escalation (meteor sign → seal activation → voice answer) without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden setting constrains choices (meteor timing forces action) and charges final image ("glass panels fracturing starlight" during ritual); wisteria/ivory tendrils establish tactile familiarity that evolves into the building's "groans and creaks like whispers" at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency (deciding to speak the words), narrowing options to "lie to the building" with felt cost (physical library shudder); escalation via single deepening ("building's language isn't dead") suffices for length but lacks visible trade-off beyond immediate risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "lies we've agreed upon" evolves from sugar-borrowing fictions to deliberate deception of the building, with final image (library answering) offering resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dialects of stone and timber," "language of old buildings") shapes diction; rhythmic control under pressure via sentence variation ("Elias stood, the seal cold in his palm. 'What do we do?'") with no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("patience was the currency of their trade" / "patiently nimble") dulls one beat; otherwise high density with strategic telling ("dismissed as imagination. Now, he wondered") and visceral propulsion ("dust rained," "teeth ache") in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms trope through specific linguistic framing ("guardian" architect, "sleeping" building language); emotional truth in quiet partnership ("only one who'd believe me without laughing") avoids abstraction while the Leonids meteor hook creates fresh causal urgency.</comment>
