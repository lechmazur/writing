<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s vigilance versus memory-hoarding; her micro-choice to place her photo earns the shift from solitary keeper to collaborative guardian. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak—tightened chest, gravel crunch—while flaws (isolation) compound meaningfully. Only minor dip: Elias’s daughter’s dialogue edges toward thematic echo but stays grounded in character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "memories… need a guardian" crystallizes Mara’s renunciation of solitary vigilance, foreclosing her old role as she places her photo. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via photos until the final trail reconfigures stakes. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Photographs function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges closure: Mara’s method of "expunging ghosts" evolves into active storytelling, with the final image of the trail literally guiding the way. Ridgeway’s moss and broken-teeth foundations mirror internal states without overt symbolism, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (memory preservation vs. erasure) tighten through Mara’s agency: discovering the label, laying photos, and accepting guardianship narrow options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional shift from hoarding to sharing, charged by the dam’s failing state. Wind chime timing subtly raises urgency without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars—the sapphire liqueur’s duality as toast/poison reweights memory’s cost. Final image ("resurfacing in stories") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "how do towns survive?" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lies in Mara inheriting Elias’s flawed but necessary burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("precisely humane," "broken teeth" for foundations) filters all detail through Mara’s warden lens. Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences when flashlight slices dark, lyrical flow in closure. No head-hopping; Elias’s daughter’s rasp voice contrasts Mara’s internal cadence perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with zero closure-beat loops—"expunging ghosts" is slight cliché but redeemed by immediate subversion ("or so she’d always believed"). Final line’s "resurfacing in stories" recharges motifs with crystalline clarity. Minor deduction for one scaffold phrase early, but propulsion remains flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reservoir trope via liqueur label’s dual meaning (clue/poison) and photo method. Risk-taking heightens stakes: memory as active guardianship avoids sentimentality. Transformation test passed—swap "sapphire liqueur" for generic bottle, and emotional specificity collapses.</comment>
