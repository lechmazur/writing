<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs tactical clarity from ink) drive choices, but her sudden mastery of adult negotiation strains plausibility for a 12-year-old; the asylum demand lacks visible cost scaling to her age.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: ink tasting enables confrontation, dummy reveal tightens options. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (asylum traded for formula), but the agents’ swift capitulation slightly softens stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Funeral home’s lilies/linen scent and ink pot function as micro-setting that constrains choice (hiding behind casket) and charges the final image; specificity in "footsteps echoing like a metronome" elevates urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: agents’ "she’s alive" threat forces active waiting into negotiation. The ink pot’s clarity enables the breach, with visible cost in her lost innocence (clutching asylum docs like a shield).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "mathematics of a fair trade" reweights the con artist premise without moralizing. Final line’s "make sure no one fakes death" offers non-literal answer to equity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink swirled violet," "footsteps as metronome") and rhythmic control under pressure shine; minor filter-verb stacks ("she saw the agents’ thoughts") slightly dilute immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "bitter, metallic, like blood" leans cliché; paraphrase loops in "wait actively" repetition (three beats) deduct 0.3. Final line’s "echo of a con artist’s honest child" rescues closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-as-weapon trope with child negotiator; "wait actively" method risks gimmickry but earns coherence through ink pot’s mechanics. Emotional specificity in asylum demand elevates beyond template.</comment>
