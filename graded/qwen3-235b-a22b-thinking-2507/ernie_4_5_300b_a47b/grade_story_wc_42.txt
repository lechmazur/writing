<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("harness ephemeral" vs time's defiance) with embodied choices under pressure; "luminous ache" slightly abstracts the final cost but micro-choices (ear trumpet use, singing) reveal authentic struggle. Flaws feel earned, not hedged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: leap into portal crystallizes escape vs control with visible cost ("wind tugging at his coat"). Causal chain holds (clock spin → leaf sound solution → portal), though structural collapse edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting—brass telescope, ear trumpet, and copper wires constrain choices and charge the final image (portal stabilized by wind/coat tug). "Clouds like boiling milk" cliché slightly dilutes specificity, but tools evolve causally with the crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control time vs. escape) tightens meaningfully: clock's acceleration forces restructure/leap. Elias's agency drives escalation (soldering, singing), and visible cost (abandoning safety) charges the closure. Foundation quakes feel slightly under-motivated as escalation drivers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "ephemeral vs. constant" emerges through concrete actions (leaf fall sound, soldering wires), not abstraction. Final leap embodies the conceptual repricing—escape velocity as liberation from taming time—without moralizing, making cost resonate through image alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("steady as star charts," "bones vibrate") and rhythmic control under pressure ("whine a shriek... deafening roar") heighten stakes. Minor register drift in "luminous ache" but voice remains consistent through Elias's technical lens and emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density ("copper wire, his mind racing" advances plot/character/atmosphere) with clean propulsion. "Spinning like a dervish" slightly loops with later "blur," but no figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("luminous ache," wind tug) crystal-clear and unadorned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "escape velocity" from physics to emotional/spiritual concept via specific tools (ear trumpet, soldering iron). Risk-taking (leap without destination) heightens stakes coherently, avoiding gimmickry while making the lunar observatory feel freshly inevitable.</comment>
