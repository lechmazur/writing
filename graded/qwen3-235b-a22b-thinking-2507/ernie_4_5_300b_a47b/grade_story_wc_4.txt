<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; grief/acceptance blend smoothly without friction. Final choice to see "masterpiece complete" feels earned yet insufficiently contested by active struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens clear by midpoint; Charged Poise closure ("factory wasn’t dying... evolving") lands with felt cost in relinquishing active transmutation. Minor cost legibility dip at closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender field/factory constrains every choice: arcs dictate sketching, vines signal time pressure, scent charges final realization. Micro-setting (map case/dove feather) reweights closure through color resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting grief) deepens via sensory accumulation, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; dove feather break intensifies reflection without altering tactics. Cost felt but not visibly reconfigured in choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Beauty in cracks" emerges organically from lavender/factory interplay; final image (dove sketch + "enough") answers central question without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in "collective healing" exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("arcs," "dove gray") sustains Accumulative lens; rhythmic control peaks in vine-crawling cadence. Minor register drift in "collective healing" abstraction mid-beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "frayed photographs," "cool metal" exemplify textural specificity. Near-synonym churn in "resilience/testament" paragraph barely avoids penalty. Final line’s "began to shoot" lacks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through industrial decay/photography synthesis; "arcs" motif feels inevitable. Avoids sentimentality via tactile details (dried lavender sprig, rusted beam). Risk in quiet closure pays off with Charged Poise.</comment>
