<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" feels urgent yet abstract; embodied emotion strong (trembling fingers, fogged dial) but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she persists without visible struggle against her purpose. Micro-choices like clutching the scrap paper reveal values, yet flaws remain untested by pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("carried the stories inside her"), but the felt cost of "weight of her purpose" stays vague. Orientation succeeds early ("ember alcove"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through signal escalation, though cost legibility weakens the final image’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss constrains setting (glow replaces light) and charges the final image ("didn’t need light to see"), while the radio dial’s physicality shapes her actions. Sensory details like "air tasted of iron" filter through her musical profession, avoiding generic post-apocalypse tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering lost stories) tighten via signal fluctuations, but escalation lacks visceral cost—pressure remains intellectual. The broadcast’s fade-out narrows options, yet the "weight of purpose" isn’t dramatized concretely; conceptual cost suffices but feels detached from her physical struggle with the dial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust/moss motifs without moralizing; "dust remembers" reframes loss as resilience. Final image ("teaching dust to sing") answers the central question resonantly, but "world was full of whispers" risks Thematic Echo by nearly stating the thesis, slightly undercutting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musical lexicon ("dirge," "lyrics encoded") colors descriptions, and compression under pressure ("pencil snagging on frayed edge") heightens tension. Voice modulates from lyrical ("mist curled like smoke") to urgent ("wrote feverishly"), though "rare, fragile thing" slips toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed edges of forgotten symphonies" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor overwriting in "thistled calm" slightly dulls immediacy, and "dust itself would stir and listen" edges toward personification muddle, but rhythm varies purposefully to match signal intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchestra copyist + pirate radio avoids tropes, yet "story famine" premise leans familiar. Emotional specificity in her tactile connection to fragments elevates it, but risk-taking stays within safe lyrical boundaries—no bold structural gambits to heighten stakes beyond the established mood.</comment>
