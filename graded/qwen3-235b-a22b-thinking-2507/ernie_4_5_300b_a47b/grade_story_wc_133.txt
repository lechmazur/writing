<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marin’s insomnia and artistic struggle manifest in concrete micro-choices (e.g., following rain trails), but her instant trust of the stranger lacks sufficient internal friction to justify the brooch exchange’s stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the final image of Marin pocketing the brooch crystallizes her shift from "puzzle-solving" to "listening," with insomnia’s easing as tangible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal island’s salt-bleached cliffs and rain-carved rivers actively constrain Marin’s movement and perception, while the brooch’s silt-burial directly enables the convergence discovery, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Marin’s agency—her choice to follow rain trails and exchange canvas for brooch narrows options—but the stranger’s coincidental arrival slightly undercuts pressure escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the brooch’s transformation from artifact to pigment, reweighting "meaning grown not threshed" via the final canvas depicting the island as "a bridge," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marin’s painterly perceptual signature ("brushes dipped in starlight") persists under stress, though the stranger’s indistinct voice slightly dilutes POV coherence during the pivotal exchange scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Haggard awe prickled Marin’s skin" edges toward therapy-speak, and "slanting sheets" of rain risks overwritten texture, but rhythmic control in the closure beats ("world wasn’t a puzzle to solve") offsets minor scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Water wars refracted through tidal island debris (wooden duck, rusted tools) transforms war tropes into specific emotional logic, though the "convergence" concept leans slightly familiar without deeper system exploration.</comment>
