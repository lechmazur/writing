<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clinging to humanity vs. necessary transformation) drives the metamorphosis choice; embodied fear ("throat tighten," "voice cracked") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of beast whisperer identity carries felt cost but micro-choices lack distinct hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: phoenix's reappearance crystallizes Lira's transformed state with undeniable cost ("no longer the beast whisperer"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; cost proof solid in "she was both human and beast, both alive and dead" with stakes reweighted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: moonthorn petals tremble during song, spice-paste glows violet, and phoenix emerges from its soil. Recurring objects (feather, obsidian) constrain ritual tactics while moonlight refracts internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening through protagonist agency: spice-scent application triggers irreversible metamorphosis, narrowing options from refusal/compliance to transformation. Cost legible in "lose herself" realization, though dominant stake (reforging bond) lacks sufficient external counter-pressure beyond internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fortune cookie's "step you fear" reweights into earned rebirth without moralizing. Final image ("keeper of secrets") offers non-literal answer to metamorphosis question, avoiding thematic echo despite explicit fortune text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira's beast-whisperer POV filters scents as "language older than speech," with stress compressing diction during transformation ("bones shifted, elongating"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via orchard's "silvered stillness."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thousands of insects crawled beneath it" slightly clichéd but redeemed by concrete progression to feathered fingers. Final line's rhythmic control ("metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth") recharges motif without overwriting. Minor cadence drag in reflection block.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Specific synthesis: "reluctant metamorphosis" transformed via spice-paste ritual and fortune cookie's mundane origin. Cosmic intimacy avoids abstraction through tactile details (cardamom paste, ash-pulse), with phoenix rising shattering moon reflection as fresh inflection on rebirth tropes.</comment>
