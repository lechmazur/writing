<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines (iron taste, slick stone) but "tired of being a queen who feels nothing" is therapy-speak mid-crisis, breaking voice and triggering diagnostic penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis when she turns away after "understood," with visible cost in abandoned disenchanted identity; "lacy menace" slightly dulls climax cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight as micro-setting charges final image and constrains choice (kneeling/dipping hands); "cobalt grotto" in setup contradicts later "ember grotto" but closure integration saves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by queen’s agency—climb to confrontation—deepens internal conflict until stance crystallizes in Charged Poise; cost legible in physical recoil and silent turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through starlight-as-mirror metaphor without moralizing; "you bleed" reweights premise with conceptual cost, avoiding final-paragraph thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight bled... pooling like liquid silver") but "lacy menace" violates queen’s plausible lexicon during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "ozone and something older, sharper—a lacy menace" has minor paraphrase scaffold but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychological journey via sensory-specific grotto; "wound where sky/earth collide" transforms trope through embodied stakes and irreplaceable closure image.</comment>
