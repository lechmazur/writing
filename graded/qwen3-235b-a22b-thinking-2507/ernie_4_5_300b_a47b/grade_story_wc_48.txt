<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s rejection of "neat endings" yet craving control; embodied via seashell warmth and deleting the chapter. But "hated herself" risks therapy-speak without deeper physiological layer during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands: deleting the chapter with shell’s warmth reconfigures "endings as doors" under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in "neat resolution crumbling into dust," though final cost proof lacks sharper physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Feral nexus functions as micro-setting—shifting ground alters Clara’s movement, mist dissolves the lantern-woman. Shell fragment charges closure: its glow on the desk embodies "unfinish," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Clara’s agency: rejecting the lantern-woman’s dissolution to rewrite the ending. Cost is felt in "crumbling into dust," but deepening lacks a second pressure point beyond the shell’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "endings as doors" crystallized through deleting the chapter, not stated. Final line avoids moralizing by rooting "trusting the journey" in concrete action—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mist curled around her ankles, whispering secrets"; lyrical compression taught early. But "chorus of whispers" slightly flattens the lantern-woman’s voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose soars with "kelp in a storm" and "pages rustling like wings," yet "child’s laughter, lover’s sigh" risks sensory checklist. Final image avoids figurative muddle, but density slightly obscures cost legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "feral nexus" as emotional landscape avoids fantasy tropes. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "against the current" concept slightly echoes familiar artistic tropes without full transformation.</comment>
