<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fractured focus" vs. "preprocessing reality") shown through micro-choices like ignoring institute demands, but "humility gnawed at her" slips into therapy-speak, weakening embodied struggle at pivotal self-doubt moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost: symposium rejection crystallizes professional isolation ("some scoffed"), but the chrysalis emergence lacks causal linkage to the final evolution insight, slightly diluting Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse debris constrains choices (bamboo stake catching dust, drainage pipe holding chrysalis), yet fungal growth as "entropy’s language" overreaches physics logic; the butterfly dust’s spiral pattern charges the final image but isn’t tactile enough to reach 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (professional identity vs. humility) tighten through dust analysis and symposium, but the botanist’s arrival resolves isolation it didn’t create—coincidence undermines Accumulative escalation; cost (career fracture) is legible though not viscerally embodied in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gradual change is the universe’s only constant" is thematic echo in final paragraph, triggering -0.7 penalty; resilience theme emerges from dust patterns but "evolved her" conclusion overstates the earned reconfiguration, lacking ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientist’s precision: "spectrometer revealed a lattice") modulates under stress, but "decay isn’t an event—it’s a language" shifts to academic register unnaturally, disrupting voice coherence at a key insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"moth-eaten ferns frond" typo and stacked metaphors ("dust motes as stellar debris") cause text-artifact clutter; strong propulsion in dust analysis beats, yet "entropy spoke in weeks" violates physical logic, dulling closure density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and ecology avoids tropes, but "butterfly dust as survival story" leans on familiar decay motifs; risk-taking (greenhouse as observatory) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the chrysalis feels slightly convenient.</comment>
