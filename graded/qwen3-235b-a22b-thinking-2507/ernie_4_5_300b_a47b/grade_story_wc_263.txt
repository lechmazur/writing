<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("mind hummed with half-formed symphonies") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet untested by tangible stakes or flaws. No visible trade-off when accessing stardust jars weakens closure's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise ("unspoken words had been here all along") with conceptual cost, but archway's chamber reveal feels coincidental rather than earned by tracing stars. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting sextant constrains choices (hologram alignment triggers chamber) and charges final image ("sextant cold against his chest"). Jars of stardust reconfigure setting into active pressure with "prickled like frost" specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing creativity) signaled early but pressure never tightens—Kael faces no opposition or meaningful trade-off. Chamber's arrival via coincidence undermines Accumulative escalation; cost ("mind buzzed") lacks felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through tangible particulars (stardust jars), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("chase the aurora again") resonates non-literally yet "Creativity isn’t trapped" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes like fractured galaxies") modulates rhythm under pressure, but spatial anchors evaporate during chamber dissolution. "Dust motes swirled" risks white-room syndrome amid intimate sensory details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion; "prickled like frost" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "stardust of grandmother’s laughter" slightly muddles metaphor without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis via sextant-as-art-tool and stardust jars transforms tropes, but aurora-as-divine-breath lacks novelty. "Unwritten calendar" risks middle-ground hedging without deeper time pressure.</comment>
