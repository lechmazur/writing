<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("throat tightened," calloused hands) and motivation rooted in preservation; lacks contradictory impulses during epiphany. Woman's appearance risks convenient resolution but "infinitely patient" trait constrains choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("throat tightened," sacred dock realization) under Accumulative lens. Fog-thickening escalation reweights stakes through density increase; no causality breaks despite mythic elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass and rope function as micro-setting constraining choices (decoding mechanics) and charging final image. Snow/fog pressure tactics during decoding; "temple to patience" crystallizes environmental cost without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through knot-decoding beats that narrow options (rope as library), culminating in conceptual cost of realizing legacy is "preservation itself." Agency drives escalation; fog-thickening raises urgency without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (seed collecting, knot patterns), not abstraction. Final image reweights "loom" as patience/roots with undeniable conceptual cost; avoids moralizing despite woman's poetic lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("obsidian-black fused sand," salt-stiffened rope) filters all details through seed-collector lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fog swallowed the dock") with no head-hopping; dialogue sparse but subtext-rich.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spirals pulsed faintly, as if remembering lightning" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor repetition of "infinitely patient" (hands/roots) is thematic reinforcement, not scaffold. Final line crystallizes momentum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "secret weavers" as ancient scientists encoding knowledge in objects avoids mythic clichés. Emotional truth in preservation drive; "fulgurite glass as lens" specificity transforms familiar tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
