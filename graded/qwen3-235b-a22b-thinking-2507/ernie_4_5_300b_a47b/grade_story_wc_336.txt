<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("preserve wonder's color") but diagnostic phrasing ("wonder was not a finite thing") breaks interiority; contradictory impulses under pressure absent despite visible cost (hollow pocket).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (iridescent blossom replacing seed), but Accumulative lens isn't clearly taught until waterfall's dissonance shift; cost proof solid via "hollow in her pocket" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall actively pressures choices (slippery stones, roaring dissonance) and the seed's absence directly charges the final image; micro-setting (hollowed stone cup) constrains the essence-capture ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with "blossoms paling," escalation driven by agency (climbing, cutting branch), but ritual execution lacks visible struggle; cost undeniable via pocket's hollow and blossom's iridescence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "thread woven endlessly" final image reweighting "color of wonder" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo but slight patness in resolution ("she knew now") prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight dripped like liquid gold") with rhythmic control, but diagnostic slip ("wonder was not a finite thing") breaks voice in peak beat; elision of seed's symbols taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but fatal artifact: "wonder was not a finite thing" is therapy-speak in closure beat; disallows 9+ globally per Text-Artifact rule despite otherwise pristine propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "pruner" role with magic preservation; risk-taking (quiet Charged Poise climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, made specific through meteorite knife and seven-generation seed logic.</comment>
