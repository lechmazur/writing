<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira's "featherly determined" resolve amid fear; final choice to step through the door earns closure through prior grain analysis. Minor slip: internal conflict lacks sufficient layering during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("terrace drifted behind her... She didn't look back") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Hairline flaw: butterfly effect revelation feels slightly rushed despite density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wood grain functions as micro-setting that constrains navigation choices and charges the final image ("grain pointed true"). Near-perfect sensory filtering through Lira's architect-child lens, though cornfield details occasionally verge on symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around "necessary distances" with tangible cost in Lira's irreversible departure. Escalation driven by her agency in code-writing, but internal/external conflict integration thins during the father's appearance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through logbook codes reweighted as life choices; final line ("remind us how far we've come") offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but "butterfly effect" phrasing risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in grain-focused observations; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("corn shuddered, door materialized"). No head-hopping, though "featherly determined" repetition slightly dilutes voice specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero text loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("kaleidoscopic shadows... planks seem alive") with clear propulsion. Minor figurative muddle in "residual energy, a hush so thick it felt like drowning" slightly obscures physical stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather codes as temporal ripples transforms maze tropes. Emotional specificity in "necessary distances" avoids genericity, though prism terrace concept edges toward familiar magical realism.</comment>
