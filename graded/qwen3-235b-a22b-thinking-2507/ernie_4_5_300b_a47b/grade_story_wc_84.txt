<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses (professional drone pilot vs. awe-struck seeker) manifest in micro-choices like hesitating at the lever. Her "perpetually surprised" trait informs authentic reactions but edge-world backstory lacks causal pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the hum in Lira's bones and "pull toward the unknown" crystallize irreversible change with visceral cost. Causal lens holds firmly from star alignment to chip assembly, though pilgrim's exposition slightly softens discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory's stone arches and rusted dome actively constrain choices (lever mechanism, niche alignment), while Lira's goggles serve as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details like "chill of the stones seeping into her boots" embody thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency: drone scan → lever pull narrows options meaningfully. Cost is undeniable in the physical resonance ("hum in her bones") and shattered expectation of answers. Pilgrim's exposition slightly reduces tension before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the final "melody without words" reweights "frequency of belonging" as embodied resonance, not decoded signal. Avoids moralizing by having Lira find "more questions" amid physical cost, making the abstract concept viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lira's augmented reality lens ("fractal patterns," "brilliant dimness") modulates under pressure. Pilgrim's harmonics-laced dialogue creates subtext, though "belonging is resonance" risks thematic echo if not for immediate narrative consequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in mid-beat ("drone beeped... sensors confirmed") causes slight momentum drag. Otherwise, high-density prose ("fractal shadows," "stones vibrating as if waking") avoids figurative muddle while advancing multiple elements per line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi tropes: "frequency of belonging" transcends cliché through embodied cost (heartbeat-synchronized waveform). Specificity in observatory mechanics and drone tech grounds the cosmic theme without derivative exposition.</comment>
