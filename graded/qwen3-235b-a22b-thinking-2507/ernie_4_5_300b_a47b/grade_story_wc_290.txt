<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via claustrophobia vs. rebellion, embodied in "claustrophobia clawed at his ribs" and the compass-jab micro-choice. Final endurance earns cost through visible trembling ("shadows deepened"), though "prudently adventurous" leans tell-y in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: compass use directly stabilizes corridor, earning key acquisition. Cost proof is airtight ("cathedral shuddered, starlight dimmed"). Minor flaw: organ's autonomous action borders on coincidence resolving spatial mutiny, slightly undercutting agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Compass functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (wall-jab stops bending corridor) and charges closure (key drops post-intervention). But "shadowed nexus" remains atmospheric rather than tactical pressure; starlight’s role stays decorative despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when corridor bends ("walls bending like rubber"), forcing compass intervention with visible cost (claustrophobia sharpening). Agency drives escalation via lunge triggering spatial shift. Spatial mutiny’s mechanics feel slightly external, lacking deeper causal roots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" emerges organically through Elias’s defiance against claustrophobia and cathedral, crystallized in the final "gateway" image reweighting "prison." Avoids moralizing, but thematic depth lacks interrogation—rebellion remains atmospheric rather than conceptually charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "breath came in shallow bursts," starlight "painting fractured blues" filters through Elias’s urgency. Rhythmic compression under stress ("He lunged forward") heightens pressure. Slight POV drift in "prudently adventurous" label mars otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("The walls shimmered, and for a heartbeat, Elias saw it") advances plot/emotion. Final line recharges "shadowed nexus" motif flawlessly. Minor artifact: "prudently adventurous" reads as template phrasing in peak tension, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Claustrophobic explorer transforms relic-hunt trope via embodied tension with spatial mutiny. Risk-taking (lyric closure as gateway) heightens stakes coherently. Freshness anchored in specific mechanics (compass-stabilized corridor), though "key bending space" feels familiar without deeper conceptual innovation.</comment>
