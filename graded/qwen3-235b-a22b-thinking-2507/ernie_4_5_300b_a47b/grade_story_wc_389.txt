<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in scene; motivation clear but interiority leans on abstract labels ("ancient shadows felt close enough to touch") without embodied struggle during pivotal prism activation. No visible cost to transformation beyond conceptual epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures Kael as "prism/storm" with conceptual cost, but cost remains oblique—no on-page sentence makes the price legible. Accumulative escalation succeeds, yet final transformation lacks causal grounding in prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt portico functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (prism mechanism activation) and charges closure (glowing threshold). Storm’s sensory pressure evolves with action (glass vibrations, refracted light), avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harnessing storm for new dawn) tightens via radio’s prism instruction, but escalation driven by external transmissions, not Kael’s agency. Conceptual cost of transformation lacks visceral felt weight despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of embracing fragility emerges through concrete actions (sand defying gravity, refracted light), not abstraction. Final threshold image reweights "ancient shadows" as blueprints without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (frequencies as "fractured hymn," storm as "language") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "variant allegiance" momentarily jars voice cohesion during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters in climax: "variant allegiance" and "lyrically prophetic" feel abstract amid sensory peaks. Avoids scaffold loops but overwrites conceptual stakes ("shadows weren’t omens... but blueprints") where embodied action needed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms isolation trope through specific physics (prism refraction, sand reversal) and emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "prophet" framework lacks fresh inflection beyond genre conventions.</comment>
