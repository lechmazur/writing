<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael's dual identity tension and sensory perception, but motivation for fragment-collecting lacks layered friction; the "void where memories should be" tells rather than embodies his compulsion under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when Marcus clutches the locket, crystallizing options with visceral cost ("realization hit like a tidal wave"), though the tide-as-metaphor payoff slightly over-signals the lens shift from Accumulative to Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (storm scramble, skeleton discovery), while the poison label charges the final image; sensory specificity like "diesel and decay" anchors crisis perception without checklist padding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through the storm sequence (container shift forcing skeleton discovery), but the conspiracy motive remains abstract; "why erase Marcus?" lacks concrete on-page escalation beyond whispered clues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through fragments reweighted at closure ("they weren't just stories—they were clues"), avoiding moralizing; the harbor's "black mouth" final image resonates without stating the cost of remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("green of jealousy," "violet of regret") modulates under stress; rhythmic control peaks in storm sequence with purposeful compression ("wind screamed, ripping at his clothes"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion except "Kael filtered reality differently" scaffold line; figurative language ("shadows stretching like living things") avoids muddle but the "tides marking time" repetition slightly dilutes density in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms erased-identity trope through sensory fragmentation mechanic; the poison label's "rats/not for remembering" duality creates fresh moral calculus, though the conspiracy premise leans familiar without deeper systemic exploration.</comment>
