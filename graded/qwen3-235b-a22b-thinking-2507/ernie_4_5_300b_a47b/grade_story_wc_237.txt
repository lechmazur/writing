<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in revisiting childhood rhymes while rejecting "nonsense," with embodied emotion in trembling hands and scar-itching. Micro-choice of whispering "Storm come, storm go" reveals hierarchy of values under stress without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: scars transforming into runes foreclose Kael’s path of fear, visible in "scars were not wounds but witnesses." Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure buildup to the crystallized ink flare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crow quill functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (trembling hands during carving) and charging the final image as "talisman." Platform’s moss-choked forest anchor evolves with "trees swaying as if in applause," reflecting internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the "saturated hush" deepens into "roared to life" as ink crystallizes, narrowing Kael’s options to embracing transformation. Cost is legible in scars shifting from "map of failures" to "language only he could read."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through scar-rune metamorphosis; "scars were not wounds but witnesses" reweights prior pain without moralizing. Final image of walking "as a storyteller embracing questions" offers resonant answer to central transformation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mist pooled like spilled milk" and "ink like liquid starlight" modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks with short sentences during crystallization ("The quill’s tip scraped the stone"), taught early and paid off in closure’s breath-holding moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "feared he’d miscalculated. Then, the rune flared" slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails. "Liquid starlight" metaphor sustains logic without muddle, and final line’s "world held its breath" crystallizes closure with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms rune-magic trope through specific emotional calculus: scars as "witnesses" feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax (no battle, just scar-transformation) heightens stakes coherently, avoiding safety-middle with "shed the lies that cage the heart" as earned insight.</comment>
