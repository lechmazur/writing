<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in climax; Mira’s shift from doubt to resolve feels unearned without visible struggle or irrationality. Elias’s “sincerely insincere” trait remains label-only, untested under pressure. Strength: cloak scene reveals character through tactile action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mira’s chime removal reconfigures options with conceptual cost (husband’s laughter in mirror void). Orientation anchored by word 20; Accumulative/Textural lens held consistently. Minor escalation softness prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Wind chimes function as micro-setting that constrains choice (unhooking alters “truth”) and charges final image. Lighthouse atmosphere vivid but passive; could be any isolated location. Meets 9+ gate via recurring object shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt vs. peace) signaled early; chime unhooking deepens knowledge. But Mira’s agency feels coached—Elias drives the action, weakening protagonist-driven escalation. Cost (ghost laughter) legible but not earned through her autonomous trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chimes as dissonant truth; final duet reweights doubt without moralizing. Strength: “certainty becomes a prison” earned via action. Weakness: Elias’s mid-scene theme articulation risks over-clarity but avoids final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing textures/sounds) and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift: “nuance” feels clinical for Elias. No head-hopping; dialogue carries subtext (“Am I crazy?” vs. “Crazy is refusing to listen”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion; “fraying” voice slightly clichéd. No loops or scaffold. Figurative muddle in “ghost of laughter” momentarily obscures mirror’s void logic but doesn’t dull closure. Final line resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “conscience for hire” transformed via specific objects (hollow mirror, wind chimes). Risk-taking (abstract concepts as tools) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure reconfiguration (chimes as language) feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
