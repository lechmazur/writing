<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (jocular shield vs. swallowed jokes) and embodied motivation (tracing boot cracks, moon rock debt) drive credible change. Lira's micro-choices ("grinning" at rules) deepen reciprocity stakes without diagnostic labels. Final grin transformation earns endurance with visible chest-ache cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ghost's "loneliness is a language" reweights premise with felt cost in Elias's physical sensation shift ("chest didn't ache"). Accumulative lens holds through density buildup (ivy, rumors) to crystallized final image. Orientation anchors by line 3 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy functions as micro-setting constraining choices (squelching mud, shivering walls) and charging closure ("less suffocating"). Moon rock's tangible warmth and final absence directly shape the climax's cost. Environment avoids symbolism by mirroring internal states through action ("ivy pulsed like a second heartbeat").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when ghost redefines loneliness as unspoken language, narrowing Elias's options from "cure" to "conversation." His agency (placing rock, stepping forward) drives escalation under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral chest-ache reduction—a felt price for reframing the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through ghost's dialogue ("loneliness is a language") and final image (chest-ache fading), avoiding moralizing. Reciprocity concept reweights via moon rock exchange without stating morals. Lingering ambiguity in "rumor chains" sustains resonance without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ivy pulsed like a second heartbeat," "jocular bark") with rhythmic control from tense buildup to quiet resolution. Lira's lexicon ("polite anarchy") contrasts Elias's physicality without convergence. Free indirect thought ("Elias didn’t believe in curses, but he believed in debts") avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances story (e.g., "mud as he followed her" implies struggle). Figurative language precise ("graffiti glowed like ancient warnings") without muddle. Final line's "jocularity no longer a shield but a bridge" delivers charged specificity with rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through disaster-relief lens and reciprocity physics. Emotional specificity in Elias's quiet change avoids template endings. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "polite anarchy" phrasing slightly echoes existing concepts.</comment>
