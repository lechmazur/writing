<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's prism-mindedness manifests in concrete micro-choices (doodle memorization, margin tracing), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "latent blaze" feels slightly abstract rather than embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the key's warmth and "world full of doors" crystallize transformation with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens held consistently through sensory deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto's mist and inverted chamber pressure choices, but the pocket watch's time limit doesn't integrate with setting mechanics; misses 9+ gate as no recurring object constrains final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Time pressure tightens stakes effectively, but escalation leans on external event (gravity inversion) rather than protagonist-driven choices; cost is felt but not deeply earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" transforms from abstract quest to physical keys, with final image reweighting the premise through "world full of doors" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kaleidoscope of timelines," "clandestinely luminous") modulates under pressure; rhythm shifts masterfully during inversion sequence with zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moss-slick stone," "damp earth" demonstrate textural specificity; inversion sequence uses precise verbs without figurative muddle despite high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes through concrete physics (gravity inversion); "seeds as physical keys" feels inevitable in hindsight, but emotional specificity lacks one fresh inflection for 9+.</comment>
