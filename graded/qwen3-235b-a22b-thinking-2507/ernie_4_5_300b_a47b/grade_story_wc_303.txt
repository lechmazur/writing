<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (throne vs garden paths), but "empire’s heart beating in time with her own" veers into therapy-speak abstraction without embodied cost within 3 lines. Mulberry ache effectively grounds emotion, yet telepathy escalation lacks setup for object-sensing stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (dismantling dream with "mulberry stain" cost), but plants' late "fists" warning feels unearned—no prior integration with telepathy trait. Accumulative lens holds, yet one distinct non-closure issue triggers -0.8 cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coffee cup functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("mulberry stain on fabric of world"), yet "midsummer sun" cliché undermines specificity. Ice violin’s melting constrains choices (humming alters tactics), but velvet observatory remains ornamental backdrop without pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Empire vs garden stake tightens via violin’s snapping strings (cadence shift), with visible cost in final ache. However, "perforated destiny" concept is echoed thematically but never actively constrains tactics—feels descriptive rather than causal under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("mulberry stain on fabric of world") reweights empire/garden conflict without moralizing. Theme emerges through coffee-stain visions and ice shattering, avoiding thematic echo. No abstraction dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("coffee swirling like a tiny galaxy"), rhythmic control during violin snapping. Minor flaw: "propagate" repetition lacks deeper voice motivation, bordering on ritualistic without character-specific lexicon evolution under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density but template cadence in "She knew the weight... How they could... This one" triggers -0.4. "Perforated destiny" synonym loops (3 near-identical uses) dull immediacy. Final-third artifacts ("waited. Somewhere, a child laughed") disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of provenance research with reality-fracturing music ("ice crystal thirsty for meaning"). Risk distinction in dismantling dream rather than choosing, yet "velvet observatory" and "midsummer" clichés cap elevation. Transformation test passed via specific stakes.</comment>
