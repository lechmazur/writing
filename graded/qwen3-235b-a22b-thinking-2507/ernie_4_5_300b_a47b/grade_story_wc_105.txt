<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "battered but marveling" final beat, though "pain was exhilarating" risks borderline label-speak without deeper embodied degradation under stress during crucible scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("battered"), but the root addition slightly strains causality as a deus ex machina for trust-breaking sound despite father's notes foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (hearing aid) charges the final image—"every color a note, every absence a chord"—while the forge actively constrains choices through vial mixing and root incorporation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through agency-driven escalation (vial additions, root severing), with the crucible's "scream of glass shattering" reweighting the dominant stake through visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly via "silence where love should be" final image without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding loss in concrete actions like severing the root.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "lavender static" color vibrations, though the "while cells divide" reflection slightly disrupts rhythmic control during high-pressure forge sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor modifier stacking ("spectral light that seeped... like liquid mercury") and near-synonym repetition ("residual warmth of forgotten fires") dull closure propulsion without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory tech and grief avoids tropes; "hearing silence between heartbeats" reconfiguration feels earned through prior particulars like the root's "scream of promises unraveling."</comment>
