<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira and Veyra's embodied contradictions drive authentic tension—Veyra's "Trapped freedom" skepticism evolving into softening growl when witnessing recapture shows earned relationship shift. No therapy-speak; emotions manifest physically through scales, tail lashing, and antler touches. Final choice to sew their name crystallizes values with visible cost in "memories altered here, but not lost."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: fog thickening, nameplate discoveries, and card's glow deepen pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in the ship vanishing as "purpose fulfilled" while "unkindled solace" transforms from hollow concept to lived reality. Orientation anchors within 80 words without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ship decay actively conceals the garden (rust obscuring entrance, fog blurring perception), while the emerald card functions as micro-setting that charges closure—sewn into soil to birth their flower. Sensory details like "salt-caked keys" and "scraping forelegs" constrain choices and mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: pressing the calliope key triggers the staircase, transforming Veyra's "myth" skepticism into active participation. Cost crystallizes when Lira realizes "the garden isn't a place—it's a choice," paying emotional price through inherited memories. Single deepening (sewing names) suffices for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—the final twin-petaled flower reweights "unkindled solace" without moralizing. "Recapture" shifts from abstract journal phrase to active verb (sewing names), while avoiding "blissfully aberrant" becoming thematic echo through Veyra's earned shift. Final image offers resonant answer: freedom as generative act, not escape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira's tactile POV ("chilling scales," "tracing card's edge") contrasts Veyra's threat-focused voice ("Trapped freedom"). Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical sprawl during garden bloom versus clipped dialogue during tension. Stress compresses syntax appropriately ("Lira descended") without POV leakage or lexical drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence multiplies meaning: "calliope swallowed by vines" implies time and decay, "petal labeled *Lira Veyra-Born*" merges identity and theme. Final line's "promise of stories" recharges fog motif with earned hope. No figurative muddle—even high-pressure beats ("ship shuddered") use active verbs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms carnival tropes through specific logic: ship's decay literally hides the garden, while "chimera twin discoverer" frames identity as active discovery. Emotional truth in name-blossoms avoids quirkiness—each flower's "unspoken tales" grounds universality in visceral detail. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's cost.</comment>
