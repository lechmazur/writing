<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's interior contradiction (skepticism vs buried longing) drives her pivotal choice to test the amber, with embodied cost in "chest ached with familiar longing." Kael's underdevelopment slightly limits relationship crucible, but micro-choices like rejecting the vial reveal authentic hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression layers rationality with irrational yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tower unchanged but Lirael's stance crystallizes with visceral cost ("chest ached"), reconfiguring options via the creaking door. Accumulative lens holds from "bronze quiet" through sculpture density to inversion sequence. Cost proof is undeniable in the aching longing—no retroactive patches or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tower and sculptures actively constrain choices (footpath navigation, amber dissolution site), charging the final image where unchanged stone contrasts internal shift. Sensory details serve urgency: "moss and memory" filters academic bias, "moth wings" mirror Lirael's fragile hope. Micro-setting (fly amber) directly enables the climax's emotional catalyst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("can homecoming be engineered?") tightens through Lirael's agency—rejecting Kael's vial to test the amber—narrowing options to self-recognition. Cost is unmistakable in her unraveled skepticism and aching longing. Under accumulative lens, sculpture density and resonance field deepening reweight stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Kael's "collision of memory, desire" crystallizes via Lirael's amber-triggered longing, not moralizing. Final image ("door creaked open") reweights the tower as self-mirror without stating a moral. Avoids thematic echo; insights arise from tactile choices like placing amber in the kneeling sculpture's hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind sharper than the storm’s edge") and rhythmic control evident in inversion sequence's fragmented syntax. No head-hopping; close third modulates with intensity ("skepticism unravel like a frayed rope"). Dialogue subtext ("You’re late") carries goal pursuit while reflecting Lirael's academic rigor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "luminous skeptic" does triple duty. Final line ("door creaked open") recharges tower motif with precision. No figurative muddle in peak beats—amber's "golden mist" serves closure without purple prose. Rhythm varies naturally from lyrical openings to staccato climax ("Then it stopped").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "artificial pilgrimages" grounded in specific details (fly amber catalyst, moth-winged wolf). Emotional truth in academic skeptic's buried longing avoids trope recycling. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently—transformation test passed as swapping names would neuter the Enclave's thematic weight.</comment>
