<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s "zen-minded" motivation for understanding over survival deepens through tactile micro-choices (placing lantern among sunflowers), but internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—her past self’s "fiercer" version lacks embodied tension in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mara’s departure crystallizes the stake (nurturing timelines) with felt cost (carrying the lesson into the wasteland), sustained under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where density shifts reweight hope’s cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass (micro-setting) constrains choice by thrumming to sunflowers, charging the final image; wasteland’s ash-taste and sunflower resilience actively pressure Mara’s investigation, avoiding postcard description through sensory causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via sunflower discovery and lantern’s thrumming, narrowing Mara’s options to observation over action; cost (enduring the wasteland’s hunger) is legible but agency remains passive—understanding feels received, not wrested from pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sunflowers anchoring timelines, avoiding moralizing; the final image (Mara shaping clay with lantern’s glow) reweights "tending light" as non-literal answer to resisting entropy, with conceptual cost in the settlement’s "hunger for hope."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind like still water" filtering ash-taste, sun patterns) modulates rhythm under pressure; minor filter-verb stacks ("Mara realized," "Mara understood") dilute immediacy during the vision beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("skeletal hives," "ghost of light") but paraphrase loops in the vision sequence ("fracture—a storm... scattering hives and time alike. But the sunflowers remained") dull momentum near closure’s edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via "phototropic to kindness" specificity; the sunflower timeline anchor feels inevitable in hindsight, risking lyric abstraction yet saved by Mara’s potter hands grounding hope in tactile craft.</comment>
