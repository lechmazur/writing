<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (atonement vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously in bleeding-finger labor; final endurance earned through micro-choices under pressure. No therapy-speak despite grief focus; "subdued ardor" embodied via lantern-lighting not declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost: "fingers bled" during projection crystallizes grief's transformation. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through stencil/light/shadow accumulation culminating in "refracted not diminished" final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: rusted telescopes and cracked dome constrain Elias' tactics (aligning stencil with constellations), while vellum stencil charges the pendant closure image. Sensory hierarchy perfect—"dust" and "mercury" time pools filter through jeweler's tactile focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens when shadows become "intentions," narrowing options to continued labor. Cost legible in bleeding fingers and "quiet, burning certainty"—not just emotional but embodied sacrifice under Accumulative lens. Agency drives escalation through lantern adjustments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete refracting light motif, not abstraction. Final pendant reweights "rock bottom" as foundation without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Elias' realization ("grief could be refracted") arises from vellum-sliver action, not final-paragraph sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: jeweler's precision ("meteorite iron," "fractal of stars") shapes noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, fractured sentences during lantern lighting ("He worked through the night") contrast with flowing dawn prose. Zero POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsed with memory of laughter" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure ("time pooled like mercury") without muddle. Final line—"subdued ardor burning brighter"—achieves crystalline closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mourning trope through specific mechanics: "curtains of intention" as light projections refracting grief. Emotional specificity ("cranes folded from sketchbook pages holding unfinished dreams") avoids genericity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
