<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s reinvented history vs gnawing truth, with embodied choices like ignoring client notes while decoding. Missing secondary character limits relationship crucible, but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sketching symbols during the song) reveal his value hierarchy with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walking toward the horizon crystallizes the cost of "blooming and withering" with the meteorite chip. Orientation is perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through dust-mote mapping to the final image, where the stake reweights with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting actively constrains choices—dust motes become the map, ledgers repurpose as journals, cassette tape drives the climax. Final horizon image charges the setting, but occupational tools (scroll case, harness) could further shape tactics beyond atmospheric use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs deception) tightens through Elias’s research, culminating in his decision to deliver personally. Agency drives escalation (ignoring client notes, sketching symbols), with cost legible in "chest tightened" and the final "blooming and withering" trade-off under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust patterns and cassette tape without moralizing; "echo" evolves from literal song to cultural preservation. Final line’s "blooming and withering" offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the meteorite’s meaning through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies") with rhythmic control matching Elias’s focus. Compression in dream sequence is taught early; no POV slips. Lexicon stays grounded in bookshop/pigeon lexicon even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight filtering in golden haze" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s poetic compression ("echo humming in his veins") avoids muddle because earlier beats established this lyric mode. Information density propels every sentence without figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms courier trope via dust-mote mapping and meteorite’s cultural weight. "Balance" motif gains meaning through physical/historical duality, avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, but "paper trails" concept lacks sufficient grounding to feel indispensable.</comment>
