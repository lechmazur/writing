<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied choices (spinning disc to alter calls) reveal contradictory impulses: craving connection yet cultivating distance. Micro-turns like routing the child’s call show earned value hierarchy. Slight abstraction in "cultivated estrangement" reflection limits 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: Mara’s smile while tracing disc cracks crystallizes cost of endurance ("tomorrow, she’d start again"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each call deepens the stake until the disc’s final vibration reconfigures "wrong numbers" as meaningful. Cost is undeniable in the lingering lullaby.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices (spinning it alters calls) and charging the final image ("fingers tracing the disc’s cracks"). Tunnel’s damp earth/copper smell directly pressures Mara’s isolation, avoiding static description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (transforming isolation into connection) tightens through Mara’s agency: each disc-spinning choice narrows options (routing calls) while deepening the cost of her endurance. The accumulation of calls escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens until the disc’s final vibration reweights meaning with palpable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the disc’s evolution: "cultivated estrangement" becomes tangible via Elise’s "recipe for grief" and the child’s dried tears. Final image ("wrong numbers could lead somewhere right") offers non-literal answer to isolation without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subway’s breath echoes through concrete veins") modulates under pressure—lyric density increases during calls but avoids muddle. Minor filter-verb use ("Mara realized") in one reflective beat prevents 9.0, though psychic distance shifts intentionally serve the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "wind through a shattered window" avoids cliché with textural specificity. High density: "flickering bulbs in a utility tunnel that smelled of damp earth" advances setting, character, and mood simultaneously. Rhythm accelerates during calls ("frayed at edges... softer now") without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms operator trope via the glass harmonica’s causal role—disc’s vibrations literally enable connections. Emotional truth in Mara’s quiet endurance avoids novelty-seeking; specificity ("payphone in a tunnel two miles east") grounds universals. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
