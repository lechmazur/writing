<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (humming, tactile exploration), but "eclectic pacifist" remains a label without concrete demonstration in action; pacifism's tradeoffs never pressure the lock-picking struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost ("silences she’d now carry forward, not as walls but as bridges"), but the "final stillness" timeframe lacks active pressure—fireworks occur but don’t tighten decisions, missing a live clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop tools constrain choice (tuning fork assembly) and charge the final image (diary gleaming in starlight); sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (ignoring fireworks boom to focus on vibration).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lirael’s agency (humming pitch adjustments), but escalation lacks visceral cost—the physical/emotional toll of her struggle remains abstract despite the resonant climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by embedding theme in action (lock yielding to resonance), though grandmother’s diary quote risks Thematic Echo; final image reweights silence as bridge without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hands intuitively descriptive," static as "unspoken things"); rhythmic control under pressure (shortening sentences during hum adjustments) with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "air hummed with the static of unspoken things" edges toward abstraction but avoids muddle; final line’s simplicity ("learned to listen") delivers propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "silence" trope through specific mechanics (vibration physics) and emotional truth; risk-taking (non-verbal closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though fireworks backdrop leans familiar.</comment>
