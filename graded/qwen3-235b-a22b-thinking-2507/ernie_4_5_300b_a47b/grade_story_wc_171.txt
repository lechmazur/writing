<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "price of redemption" musings but "operatively gentle" label disrupts embodied emotion; calloused hands tracing scars grounds Elara’s struggle effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with statues’ silent vigil and "price never fully paid," though celestial bodies motif slightly over-signals the lens shift at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic terrace and clipboard constrain every choice—Elara’s anchor against eroded gods—and charge the final descent; sensory specificity (coffee stain, bitter tea) avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through micro-choices (tapping clipboard, guiding clauses) with visible cost in "shaking hands" signatures, but escalation lacks one tangible forfeiture beyond emotional regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from clipboard scars and "flawed beauty" of compromise, but final line’s "peace worth the fight" moralizing triggers thematic echo penalty in Q5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels (sun’s "languid arc," "stone faces etched with wisdom"), though "operatively gentle" diction drifts into corporate register under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters with "operatively gentle" repetition and "slow dance" overuse; otherwise vivid cadence ("shadows stretching like a bridge") avoids loops until final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms peace-negotiator trope through visceral tools (stained clipboard) and earned ambiguity, but "flawed beauty" phrasing edges toward safe middle without bold risk.</comment>
