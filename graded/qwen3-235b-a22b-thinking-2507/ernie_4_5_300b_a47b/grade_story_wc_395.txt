<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs obsession) manifests in micro-choices like handling the patch, but "sensed absence" veers toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, diluting embodied emotion at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lira's escape forecloses passive investigation with felt cost (drones advancing), and the causal lens holds through the video→coordinates→upload chain. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The patch functions as micro-setting (constraining choices when held up at climax), but the archive remains backdrop; servers hum without actively pressuring tactics beyond generic "cold light" descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through Hale's lie→video→drones, with visible cost in the confrontation. Agency is Lira's throughout, though the "world remembered" resolution slightly abstracts the cost from the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasure emerges through concrete particulars (deleted files, patch, numbers), but the final line's "make sure the world remembered" edges toward thematic echo, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flicker of code," "ghostly impressions") modulates rhythm under pressure; only minor register drift in "sensed absence" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "brightly attentive" repeats verbatim in high-pressure beats, creating subtle synonym churn that dulls immediacy during the climax sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate archivist + space mystery avoids tropes through specific tech details (neural implant, metadata traces), yet the "recurring numbers" mechanic risks feeling like a familiar puzzle trope.</comment>
