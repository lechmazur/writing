<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (admitting fear while working faster) and contradictory impulses (duty vs. dread), but Elias' "silence isn't always kindness" borders on thematic echo without sufficient character-specific framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the lifted weight from Mara's chest ("a burden she hadn’t known she carried") provides undeniable felt cost under the Accumulative lens, with density escalation via unraveling knots narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tapestry needle functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (dulled tip requiring precision) and charges closure through its rhythmic use during the net's dissolution, though prism light's role remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten as accumulated whispers escalate pressure under Mara's agency, but the dominant "fear of truth" stake lacks concrete pre-climax testing beyond her admission, slightly muting cost legibility before the burst of light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the net's unraveling (silence as prison), with the final hum offering resonant non-literal answer; weakened slightly by Elias' near-preachy line about silence not being kindness, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("threads falling away like old skin"), and stress-modulated syntax ("She began to work faster") sustains voice, though "interlaced hush" risks register drift into poetic abstraction during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with masterful propulsion ("Each knot loosened, a whisper escaping"), but "chorus of ghosts pleading to be heard" edges toward overwriting in a peak beat, slightly muddling the otherwise crystalline closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "broken mask restorer" with silence-as-accumulation avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details (salt-caked net, tapestry needle), though the prism sanctuary risks ornamental proximity to common "light-refracting" motifs without deeper transformation.</comment>
