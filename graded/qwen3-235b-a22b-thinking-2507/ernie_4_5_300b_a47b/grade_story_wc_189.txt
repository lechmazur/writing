<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (retreat vs. bridge-building) manifest in micro-choices like repositioning the cicada; final choice earned through tactile memory work. Slight over-articulation in epiphany ("fermented, like seaweed") avoids diagnostic labels but edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s nod crystallizes stance with felt cost in the unresolved-but-progressing argument. Tide’s turn and stars brightening reconfigure options under accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (tide’s rhythm) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto environment actively constrains choices (tide dictates timing) and charges final image (cicada as beacon). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: crisis narrows to water’s cold, calm admits moonlight fractures. Final "sea agreed" makes setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (communicating during conflict) tightens via Elara’s agency: repositioning cicada alters tactics. Cost is unmistakable in the "pause" they navigate—Kael’s softened shoulders show earned progress without resolution. Escalation driven by her tangible choices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cicada/tide particulars: "fermented, like seaweed" offers resonant non-literal answer to transition anxiety. Final image (cicada as guardian) reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices tidal textures, not tourist sights. Rhythmic control under pressure—shorter sentences during argument, fluid cadence at resolution. Dialogue indirection ("What’s your point?") carries subtext while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "moonlight fractured on the surface" does triple duty (image/mood/metaphor). Minor paraphrase loop in "warmly observant" descriptions (para 1/5) avoids peak beats. Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "symbol resolves conflict" trope through tidal chronicle specificity. Emotional truth in small repositioning of cicada—not grand gesture but precise micro-choice. Fresh inflection: cicada as "silent guardian of the in-between" synthesizes transition theme organically.</comment>
