<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marisol’s contradictory impulses (control as restorer vs surrender to uncertainty) drive her micro-choices, with the final stance crystallization—exchanging certainty for curiosity—earned through embodied cost (throat tightening, pulse quickening) and irreversible knowledge shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the final realization ("awakening was not a destination, but a rhythm") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (surrendering certainty), while the Accumulative/Textural lens (density buildup via sound harmonics) holds without contradiction past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (positioning in concave dish) and charges the closure image (slipped into pocket), while the garden’s tangible sound waves actively pressure tactics—no ornamental description, only purpose-driven sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Marisol’s agency (adjusting dish angle, whispering "Show me"), tightening the dominant stake (awakening secrets) until the conceptual cost—exchanging certainty for curiosity—becomes undeniable in the final image’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Certainty is a cage" is earned via the mural’s dissolution and grandfather’s lullaby, with the final line ("forever curious") offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the nickel’s meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing sound frequencies as textures) and rhythmic control under pressure ("cracks began to shimmer, as if the stone were breathing") modulate with emotional intensity, avoiding head-hopping while compressing time for the liminal "pause" beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story through high-density prose ("petals tremble or stones hum"), with peak-beat clarity during the mural’s revelation—no figurative muddle, only purposeful cadence shifts matching the sound wave motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "awakening memories" trope via specific acoustics (hobo nickel as harmonic prism), with emotional truth in intergenerational curiosity; the sound-based magic system avoids cliché through verifiable detail (E-flat drone, fractal wind chime).</comment>
