<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's "earnestly naive" persistence despite exhaustion; Marla's pressure forces his endurance choice with visible cost (collapsing against glass). No diagnostic labels—only embodied struggle like "hands shook from exhaustion" grounding the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the work wasn’t done—the bell would need constant adjustment" crystallizes the fragile balance. Accumulative lens holds through drip-rate escalation; the "last fish" timing tightens options, and cost proof is explicit in the final image’s unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bell’s physicality constrains every choice—its cracks dictate drip adjustments, and the viaduct’s glass supplies the pulse Elias syncs to. Final image ("drip a metronome for the viaduct’s pulse") charges the setting, meeting the 9+ gate by making environment integral to closure’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is pure Accumulative pressure: Elias’s agency narrows options through incremental drip adjustments under baking sun, culminating in the live-clock tension of "as the last fish was caught." Cost is unmistakable in his collapse and the rift’s temporary "stitch," fulfilling the Q4 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the bell’s "brittle shell" mirroring Elias’s devotion—without moralizing. Final line reweights "fragile, flawed, earnestly naive kind of faith" as a resonant answer to cosmic imbalance, avoiding Thematic Echo despite the "madness" quote.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "dripping rates" and "viaduct’s pulse" like a mage-scientist. Rhythm shifts under pressure (staccato "Drip. Drip. Drip." during climax), and Marla’s dialogue carries subtext ("less so") without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "He’d calculated the rate..." slightly dulls momentum, but zero loops or figurative muddle. High density shines in "the bell’s tone grew steadier, its drip a metronome"—concrete verbs and rhythm serving propulsion without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "lukewarm mage" trope through specific physics-magic synthesis (drip-rate calibration). Emotional truth in "faith" being "fragile" avoids generic hope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure for cosmic stakes feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
