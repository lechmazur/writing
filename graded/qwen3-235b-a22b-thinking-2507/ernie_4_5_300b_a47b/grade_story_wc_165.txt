<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s analytical/creative contradiction drives every choice; the bishop piece embodies her philosophy without becoming symbolic shorthand. Final endurance ("Always. Between acts.") carries visible cost in drained energy and altered crowd dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the arcade held still, as if waiting for permission to breathe again" crystallizes the social risk of disrupting monotony. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density escalation to the fountain’s flare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bishop’s chess piece (micro-setting) constrains Lira’s playing technique and charges the final image ("glinting in the fountain’s light"), reweighting her intent. Tidal arcade’s mechanics (clown’s gears, fountain lights) directly pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase—neon flickers, drunk’s humming, clown’s loop—tightens the dominant stake (disrupting monotony) until the discord breaks the cycle. Cost is unmistakable in the held breath before applause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chess/music synthesis: the compass rose glinting reweights "orchestrated serendipity" as shared vulnerability, not control. No moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars like the faltering clown mechanism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("arcade was a chessboard," trajectories noted) creates distinct rhythm under pressure. Syntax tightens during discord ("bow slashed"), then spirals with the melody—no head-hopping, pure focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor paraphrase loop ("lightly attentive gaze... cataloging reactions") prevents 9.0. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats—fountain’s "rainbow hues" woven into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy and musical improvisation transforms "calculated wilderness" from trope to lived reality. The compass rose tattoo reveals shared yearning, avoiding safe middle-ground choices.</comment>
