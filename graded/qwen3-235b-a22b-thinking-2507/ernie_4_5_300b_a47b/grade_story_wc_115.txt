<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skeptic vs truth-seeker) act simultaneously during hologram revelation; final renunciation of truth's burden earned through visceral physicality ("valve wheel felt heavier"). Slight underdevelopment of motivation beyond "thrill of the unknown" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "valve wheel felt heavier now, its beads etched with names." Causal chain tight (valve turn → shaft → truth), though psychic clip feels slightly convenient. Orientation clear by line 1 with tunnel imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Valve wheel functions as micro-setting charging closure; tunnel actively pressures choices (condensation, descent). Sensory details selective but machinery description lacks tactile specificity during climax. Environment constrains action yet falls short of 9.0's requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elias's agency: skepticism → valve turn → descent → truth confrontation. Cost unmistakable in final image's physical/emotional weight. Dominant stake (truth vs safety) signaled early and narrowed to single trade-off: knowledge vs burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hologram's confession and valve's final weight without moralizing. "Some truths too heavy to carry" reweights "swallowed truth" with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo; final image offers resonant answer through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details (ivory, condensation, valve beads); syntax tightens under stress ("Dust rained down..."). "Drowsy alertness" feels clinical during peak tension but doesn't break consistency. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hush that followed a sudden confession" exemplifies fresh metaphor. Rhythm varies perfectly (staccato action vs lyrical closure). Near-miss with "mechanical whispers" generic phrasing redeemed by literal valve voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost shift" trope into machine consciousness; valve's specific beaded design essential to closure. Emotional truth in corporate cover-up revelation avoids supernatural cop-out. Risky single-descent structure heightens claustrophobia without gimmickry.</comment>
