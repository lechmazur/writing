<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (ritual vs chaotic truth), but flaws lack compounding struggle; competence feels frictionless without inevitable mistakes. Final choice earned but cost escalation muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "truth—raw, unvarnished, and heavy" crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds tightly (blackout→sound→sketch→stamp→vault) with no loopholes. Orientation nailed by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (antique stamp) constrains choice (alignment necessity) and charges closure ("owl crest now a symbol"). Bioluminescent jars enable critical action; algae on stairs alters movement. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake signaled early ("understand why abandoned"), deepened through agency (indexing skills solve vault). Cost legible in "throat tightened" and journal's weight. Escalation slightly smooth—pressure could intensify faster.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "reclaimed stillness" shown via stamping ritual→truth-sharing, not stated. Final image reweights "dappled resolve" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("tranquilly perceptive gaze adjusted to gloom"), rhythm modulates under pressure. Minor register drift: "logical indexer" label slightly over-explained early versus later subtlety.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dappled resolve" avoids cliché. Final line recharges motif with precision. Only microscopic flaw: "breath steady" borders generic but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "sunken city" trope through indexer's logic; emotional truth in "quiet confession of failure." Risk-taking (truth as burden, not triumph) heightens stakes coherently. No derivative premise.</comment>
