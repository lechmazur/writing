<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("curse" vs "gift") earned through embodied memory flood; micro-choice to uncork vial shows hierarchy of values with visible cost in trembling hands and tears. Avoids diagnostic labels despite high emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: final breath with city smells reconfigures stakes by making grief a conscious act, with felt cost in "tears hot and sudden" earlier. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift from lavender triggers to earned acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains choice via UV panels dictating timing; crystal vial's physical properties (faceted, silver vapor) charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters through Lirael's olfactory sensitivity during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scent-triggered grief) tightens via single escalation: uncorking vial risks unraveling, paid with emotional cost in tears. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but secondary pressure lacks depth for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: perfume as "vessel for memory" reweights grief as "testament to love" without moralizing. Final breath with woodsmoke offers non-literal answer to central question through sensory reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in olfactory focus ("wistful lantern broker" profession shapes noticing); rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to staccato during memory flood. No head-hopping despite embedded visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops but slight overwriting in "crystal shadows dancing across walls" during high-pressure beat. Information density strong though "silver vapor rose, twisting like a ghost" edges toward stock imagery. Final line propulsion impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific bioluminescence premise; "inherited sorrow woven into DNA" feels fresh yet inevitable. Bold risk in sensory-driven Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
