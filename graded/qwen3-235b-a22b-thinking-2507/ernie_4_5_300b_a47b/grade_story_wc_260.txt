<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "fragile convictions" borders on thematic echo; micro-choices during tail reconstruction reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, though emotional progression slightly abstract in shedding layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("shed layers of her own"), but cost legibility lacks concrete specificity; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift from mist to dawn light, though pressure remains entirely internal without tangible opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop functions as active micro-setting: velvet cloth and skylight constrain reconstruction tactics, while the tail's shifting hues charge the final image; environment directly shapes the protagonist's physical and emotional process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation of sensory/emotional weight toward dawn, but dominant conflict (compassion vs. exploitation) lacks external pressure points; cost of shed fears is earned yet slightly abstract for high-band escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tail reconstruction as "map of survival," avoiding direct moralizing; final realization ("compassion wasn't a liability") risks bordering on statement but remains grounded in physical action and earned through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/scale observations) and rhythmic control under pressure; syntax modulates from fragmented ("The workshop’s shimmering stillness seemed to hold its breath") to flowing at dawn, with zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "velvet cloth, its iridescent scales catching starlight" demonstrates multi-jobbing language; minor scaffold in "convictions had always been fragile" but no loops or artifacts, especially in high-pressure reconstruction beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "broken idealist" trope through wildlife-specific lens and tail-as-survival metaphor; emotional specificity in "shedding layers" avoids generic templates, though "quietly vivid" phrasing slightly echoes prompt language.</comment>
