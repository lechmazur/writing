<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia and grief manifest in embodied, contradictory choices (pressing palm to wall while descending; enduring panic to place the fleck). Flaw integration is strong but the college physics recall lacks concrete struggle, slightly undercutting earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: water at waist crystallizes stakes with visceral cost ("tears blurred her vision") while the "memorials" realization reweights the premise. Causal lens holds perfectly—tidal pressure directly forces the terminal action and escape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rust/salt air and tidal clock actively constrain choices (rushing against rising water), but facility details like "shattered glass cases" remain atmospheric without altering tactics. Gold fleck’s final dimming charges the image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes narrow causally: tide rising → water to ankles → waist, forcing the terminal action. Lira’s agency (slapping on the fleck) creates irreversible cost (proof is data, not reunion), with visible tradeoffs between escape and verification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "memorials etching the unremembered" reweights "tracks invisible things" without moralizing. Final image ("claustrophobic and trembling, had stood by them") resonates through concrete cost (water, brother’s blip), avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice distills Lira’s psyche via sensory precision ("air tasted of rust and salt") and stress-tightened syntax ("Grabbing the codex..."). Near-cliché "pulse raced" slightly dilutes perceptual signature but doesn’t disrupt rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("gold fleck’s light dimmed, its purpose fulfilled" compresses action/theme). One paraphrase loop ("water began seeping... pulse raced... had to act fast") deducts 0.2 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "lost sibling" trope via electromagnetic memorials—fresh synthesis where tech becomes elegy. Risk-taking (phase transitions as emotional catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior science integration.</comment>
