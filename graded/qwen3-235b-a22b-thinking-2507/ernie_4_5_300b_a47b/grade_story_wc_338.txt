<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete micro-choices (threading film, dabbing holy water), but epiphany lacks sufficient embodied contradiction; "warm silence" realization feels slightly convenient without deeper struggle against his map-framer identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost—abandoning border-thinking for "questions"—but holy water solution feels unearned; sextant alignment provides causal grounding yet the ritual lacks prior setup, weakening escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Map tear and henge carvings actively constrain choices (sextant alignment, frame comparison); final "frame with questions" image charges setting by transforming the tear from division to invitation, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (silence as language) tightens via film comparison revealing carving shifts; cost manifests in Elias’s worldview shift, but the "reopening" mechanism lacks sufficient friction—no tangible sacrifice beyond intellectual surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (comparing frames, listening), not statement; final image reweights "tear" as "invitation" with resonant ambiguity, avoiding moralizing while answering the central question through charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trained to see borders where others saw blankness") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats; film-threading syntax compresses tension, while chapel descent modulates into lyrical warmth without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "parchment creaking under his touch" exemplifies textural specificity; zero loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for "methodically curious" label (telling), but redeemed by immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/archaeology tropes; "silence as language" feels inevitable through serpent-sun carvings and vowel-less hymn. Avoids abstraction via Elias’s map-framer lens and tangible henge mechanics.</comment>
