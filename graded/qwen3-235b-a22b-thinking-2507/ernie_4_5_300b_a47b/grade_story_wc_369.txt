<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s methodical dismantling versus spiritual yearning, but "sorrow as language" epiphany feels slightly unearned without deeper struggle in the pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("work never done") under Accumulative lens, though the pin-drop motif lacks causal escalation to tighten the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sextant and tree roots function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image—Elias’s touch triggering memories proves irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via moonlight’s healing constraint, but the pin-drop tension never meaningfully pressures the core sorrow-language realization, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (tree-etched sorrow, dream-mapped cogs), avoiding moralizing; the final "beauty in decay" image reweights prior material with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—obsessing over stone decay and root memories—modulates rhythm with the storm’s intensity, showing Elias’s state through selective sensory narrowing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("storm intensified"/"storm raged") and slight tell ("healing property at work") mar otherwise crystalline propulsion, though closure remains unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth tropes through quantified sorrow and mundane miracles; the tree-root corridor’s emotional specificity avoids abstraction, making the risk-taking feel inevitable.</comment>
