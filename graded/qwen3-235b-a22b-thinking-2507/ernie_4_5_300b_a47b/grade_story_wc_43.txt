<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' silent words/fear-faith war, embodied via "raspy whisper" and "loosening grip." Clara's micro-choice (taking vinyl shard) reveals hierarchy of values. "Scent of hope" slightly abstracts emotion but saved by lavender anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: Elias' "Rest..." dissolves into sigh while grip loosens, crystallizing options with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density ("music swelled... pulsing stillness") not causal turns. Cost proof: "breathing grew shallow" as monitors flatline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: vinyl shard constrains choices (turntable placement, Clara's final taking) and charges closure as "pact." "Radiant haven" pressures tactics via sky focus ("he loved the sky"). Sensory hierarchy perfect—crisis narrows to "crackle," calm admits "fragrant hope."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (bridging fear/acceptance) tightens through Accumulative escalation: hymn density increases to crescendo, then skips as Elias dies. Protagonist agency drives deepening ("hymning the mundane" method). Cost unmistakable in "loosening grip" and flatlined monitors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from vinyl shard's physicality, not abstraction. Final image (Clara taking shard, Mira humming) reweights "pulsing stillness" without moralizing. "Scent of hope" borders thematic echo but saved by lavender integration. Non-literal answer to "light persisting" via orange sunset.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: Mira notices "frayed edge" of vinyl, "cloudy but alert" eyes. Rhythm modulates—short sentences during crisis ("breathing shallow"), lyrical flow for music. No head-hopping; Clara's POV filtered through Mira's observation ("sobs muffled").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing stillness" reprises meaningfully in climax/final line. Figurative language sparse and earned ("clutching hand like anchor"). "Scent of hope" risks overwriting but doesn't dull closure. Propulsion flawless—every line advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes via vinyl shard specificity and "hymning the mundane" method. Emotional truth avoids sentimentality—Elias' death has "wild" eyes moment. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off. "Radiant haven" slightly familiar but redeemed by sky pressure.</comment>
