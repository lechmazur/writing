<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's "stubbornness with a thesaurus" manifests in micro-choices (fob hesitation, false starts sharpening resolve), but the buyer lacks depth as pure antagonist. Contradictory impulses (grief vs duty) are embodied yet could deepen; "comforting unease" subtly charges the final cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: smashing the device creates decisive change with visible cost (cracked fob, market chaos). Causal lens holds throughout—midnight deadline tightens options, and the final image's ticking hands reconfigure "hush" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (token for key, smashing weapon) and charging the final image. Saltspire Pier details (barnacled pilings, frozen clock) pressure tactics, though opium/brine sensory blend leans slightly generic in the market hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Midnight deadline creates meaningful tightening: Lira's agency drives escalation (e.g., false starts inform tower sprint), and sacrificing the fob pays visible cost. Dominant stake (stop device sale) is viscerally felt through the buyer's recording playback and shattered glass voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Silence as gold standard" theme emerges through action, not moralizing. The cracked-but-ticking fob reweights "hush" as earned burden in the final image—resonant without abstraction. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in physical cost (chain biting her palm).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide gnawed at barnacled pilings") modulates under pressure; tower ascent compresses diction cleanly. Minor register drift in "curiously steadfast" feels authorial, but psychic distance holds through Lira's embodied urgency ("breath echoing" on stairs).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "patrons scattering like roaches" simile verges on cliché, slightly dulling the closure image. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances momentum, though "comforting unease" risks abstraction without the fob's concrete damage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of auditory trust-breaking device with tactile fob; specific details (clock frozen at 2:17, porcelain doll mask) avoid trope. Transformation test passed: removing the pier's decay or "hush" philosophy would break stakes, yet emotional truth anchors the risk.</comment>
