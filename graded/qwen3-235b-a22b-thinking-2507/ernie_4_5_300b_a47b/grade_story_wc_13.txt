<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lila’s fear/curiosity during the fissure reveal; her sketching impulse as micro-choice under pressure ("pencil flying") earns the final endurance with visible cost. No therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila’s refusal to dismiss her vision ("she’d found the truth") forecloses naive documentation with conceptual cost in the final sketch. Accumulative lens holds via cadence shifts ("time lurched"), and the "borrowed moments" cost is legible in the cooled pendant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system functions as micro-setting: moss-crusted stones and railing constrain Lila’s physical choices (leaning over, stumbling), while the pendant’s cooling directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Lila’s agency—her twist of the pendant narrows options to entering the tunnel—with visceral cost in disorientation ("thickened air"). Stakes tighten via the giant’s stirring snores, reweighting her understanding of echoes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: time as a "loom" woven from "borrowed moments" crystallizes in the final sketch of the giant as "weary parent," offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo taints the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pencil hovering over moss-crusted stones") and rhythmic control under pressure ("raindrops hung suspended") shine. Purposeful compression in the tunnel sequence teaches its pattern early and pays off in the closure’s quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("waves moved backward, then forward, then sideways") slightly dulls momentum, but otherwise high density ("snores stretched into deafening roar") and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s rhythm charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms time-weaving tropes via canal physics and the giant’s "borrowed moments" ritual. Risk-taking in the quiet closure ("not meant to be told in a single breath") heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
