<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority excels via "fingers brushing moss-speckled floorboards" and trembling hands during planting, revealing contradictory impulses (fear of touching bread vs. need to act). Final choice to plant seed earns endurance with visible cost in calloused hands, though micro-choice during climax lacks deeper value hierarchy conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly when Elias understands creeping normality "was a map," with felt cost in his softened eyes and vanishing bread. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; saplings' growth reweights stakes through patterned density shift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-choked tea house constrains choices immediately (Elias must kneel in soil), while the bread's physical impossibility charges the final seed image. Recurring object (bread→seed) directly shapes tactics and closure, satisfying 9+ gate for environment-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of creeping normality) tightens when Elias chooses to plant seeds, narrowing options from passive observation to active rebellion. Pressure accumulates via saplings' growth under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven intensification beyond the initial planting act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "cracks where light seeps" metaphor, reweighted by the final seed image without moralizing. The resonant answer—"sacred wasn't hidden; it was waiting"—arises from concrete actions (planting, bread vanishing), avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "roses bloomed paler every year" and "leaves unfurling like green flames." Rhythmic control modulates perfectly under pressure (short sentences during bread confrontation), with all elisions taught early and paid off in the final reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crusty and golden" bread description does triple duty (sensory, symbolic, causal). Final line "had finally learned to see it" recharges opening motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the bread encounter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "creeping normality" from observation into actionable map through guerrilla gardening. Specific details (vanished Elm Street bakery, heuristically gentle approach) ground universals, avoiding tropes while risking unconventional closure via Earned Stasis.</comment>
