<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in keeper's judgment-vs-witness tension, embodied via "grip on reality loosening," but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal river-crossing moment; micro-choices like hand-dipping reveal values without full-blown internal war.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with keeper's "grip on reality now a faint echo" and smile at stone wall—cost is palpable in relinquished identity; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory accumulation tightens stakes toward silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library and river aren't backdrop but active constraints: algae-slick tunnel forces scraping hands, black water's shattering surface enables passage; final image of "soft black sand" charges the closure with environmental specificity that reweights prior decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping judgment for regenerative silence) tightens through keeper's burrowing agency; cost is unmistakable in "stranger's face" reflection and reality's "faint echo," though the river's backward flow feels slightly convenient rather than earned through prior constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: keeper becoming "silence, becoming change" reweights the library's "unread truths" without moralizing; final river image ("unburdened and free") resonates as non-literal answer to "witness change without judgment" central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in keeper's decay-focused noticing ("moth-eaten tome," "scent of decaying paper"); rhythmic control peaks during tunnel climb with staccato phrasing ("hands scraping," "air tasted of iron") that mirrors physical strain without losing lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper brittle yet stubborn" exemplifies high-density prose, though "crumbling peace" slightly borders on mixed metaphor in the library description—no artifact dulls the closure's "river flowed on, unburdened" final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms library archetype through keeper's reality-loosening journey; "origami swan's folds relaxing into oblivion" synthesizes object, character, and theme into inevitable freshness, though river refuge risks familiar "sacred space" trope without the keeper's radical self-annihilation.</comment>
