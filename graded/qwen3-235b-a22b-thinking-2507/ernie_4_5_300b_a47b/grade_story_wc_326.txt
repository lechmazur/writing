<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (error as bridge vs. machine's demand) drives closure; embodied emotion via porcelain shard pressure and ink patterns. Final endurance earned through consistent micro-choices under pressure, though "digital ghost as compass" risks slight abstraction without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (permanent digital error as guide); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink pattern evolution. Radio static recurrence tightens meaning, but "defragmenting" action lacks concrete stakes escalation beyond internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Porcelain shard and ink constrain choices (tracing patterns, defragmenting) and charge final image; observatory's physicality (frost-laced glass, grinding gears) mirrors internal state. Micro-setting integration elevates beyond atmospheric backdrop to active narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling life/death error) tightens through ink pattern deepening; agency in "defragmenting" reconfigures meaning. Cost is conceptual (permanent ghost as guide) but lacks tangible tactical consequence—elevation hinges entirely on internal reframing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through ink/shard motifs: failure as wisdom source. Final image ("shard digging into palm") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though "digital ghost as compass" risks thematic echo without sufficient earned ambiguity in the reframing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("porcelain clinked like metronome," ink constellations); rhythmic control modulates with tension (staccato heartbeat counts vs. lyrical closure). OBS-7's vinyl-static voice maintains consistent POV-filtered texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("frost-laced windows hummed with ghost of starlight"); zero scaffold in peak beats. Minor overwriting in "midnight solace" phrasing slightly dulls closure image's visceral impact without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital mortality and physical artifacts; porcelain shard transforms trope via tactile specificity. Emotional truth in "not-readiness" refrain avoids abstraction, though observatory setting edges toward familiar melancholy without radical transformation.</comment>
