<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's interior contradiction (pacifism vs inherited violence) manifests in concrete micro-choices: using the knife to plant, not sever. Her "senselessly perceptive" trait drives the pivotal realization about the roses' struggle, avoiding label-only embodiment. Final renunciation of her father's penance for active revolution feels earned through the sandbag burial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: whispering "quiet" to the soil crystallizes the conceptual repricing (silence as active focus) with undeniable cost in calloused hands and the howling sandstorm. Accumulative lens holds through refracted light/sand imagery; orientation is anchored by line 3 ("glass dome, desert rose").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass dome constrains every choice (roses thrive due to its rigidity) and charges the climax—Lira pressing her palm to its "cool barrier and bridge" reweights the entire legacy. Desert roses aren't static; they "nod" toward her during the final check, making setting inseparable from agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lira redefines "quiet" as focus, narrowing her path to active stewardship. The cost is visible in her calloused hands (soil, not combat) and the abandoned penance. Agency drives escalation: her digging/humming transforms the scrap, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The final image—whispering "quiet" to roots—reweights the engraved word without moralizing, answering "can life persist in ruin?" through dew-glistened petals. Theme emerges from ballast sand becoming growth medium, avoiding thematic echo; looters are "leaves" but Lira's path isn't falsely balanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's perceptual signature ("sand glittered like fractured starlight") filters all description through her pacifist lens. Syntax modulates under pressure: fragmented during digging ("She began to dig"), flowing in reflection. Zero head-hopping; backstory anchors in the sandbag scrap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "fractured starlight" and "symphony of containment" avoid purple prose by serving pressure. One elevated phrase ("senselessly perceptive") risks abstraction but is immediately grounded in rose tremors. Final line’s "revolution" recharges the sandbag scrap without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "pacifist heir" trope through desert roses thriving via dome-induced struggle. Emotional specificity in Lira’s quiet rebellion—no grand gestures, just tending blooms while storms rage—avoids generic templates. Glass dome’s "tranquil blaze" offers fresh physics-to-metaphor synthesis.</comment>
