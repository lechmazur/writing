<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "mournfully eager" stated not embodied through micro-choices during climax. Final collapse earns endurance with visible cost (blisters, tears), but emotional progression remains singular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: laughter's return crystallizes options with visceral cost (physical collapse, tears). Orientation clear by para 1; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation. No causality breaks despite lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel constrains every choice—macerating walls, echoes responding to blasts—and charges final image with shimmering voices. Sensory specificity ("frayed cord," "sweaty grip") filters through Marlowe’s urgency, avoiding symbolism. Micro-setting as pressure source elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring laughter) tighten through escalating physical cost (blisters, hoarse voice), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven deepening; tunnel’s response feels coincidental rather than earned by his choices. Cost legible yet agency passive in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "macerating air" motif reweighted at closure—laughter as tangible force, not abstraction. Avoids moralizing; final image ("thousand tiny voices") resonates non-literally. Risks sentimentality but saved by concrete stakes (empty rooms, dust).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint grooves of forgotten laughter," "off-key wind") reflects Marlowe’s attunement to echoes. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: lyrical calm to fragmented urgency ("sang louder, voice cracking"). No POV slippage despite reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "mournfully eager" borderline label but offset by embodied details ("gloved hands trembling"). Slight overwriting in "conduit for echoes of happiness," yet propulsion remains relentless. Final image ("contented purr") avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mundane tools (leaf blower) into emotional conduits with specificity. Risk-taking (symphonic trash device) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "macerating air" redefines conflict. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable, avoiding derivative "magical realism" tropes.</comment>
