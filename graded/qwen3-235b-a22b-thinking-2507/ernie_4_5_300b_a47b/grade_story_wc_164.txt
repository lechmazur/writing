<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s "cheerful gloom" paradox and embodied regret (amber shard as "molasses left too long") create visceral interiority. Micro-choices like pressing seeds into glass reveal value hierarchy, but secondary pressure is absent with only one character, capping near 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "paths disappeared not because forgotten, but released" with visceral cost in the dissolving pool. Orientation is clear by word 20, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the final image’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The geode’s light actively constrains transliteration (shard cloudiness clearing under golden hue) and charges the pool dissolution. Crater glass as micro-setting directly alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping the final image’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lira’s seed experiment narrowing options to "release vs forget," with cost legible in the fog-consumed path. Agency drives escalation, but pressure lacks one more intensification before the pool revelation to enter 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the pool’s dissolving images—no moralizing—reweighting "holding on" as pain. The final line ("world let them go") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("prismatic whispers," "feathers like oil on water"), modulating rhythm during stress (shorter phrases at pool climax). No POV slippage, but slight overwriting in "bioluminescent glow" risks cadence drag near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No closure-touching artifacts, but "her purpose was to collect" (telling) and minor scaffold in the conjecture explanation reduce density. Figurative language remains coherent and purpose-driven even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Recollectionist" synthesizes memory/erosion tropes with irreplaceable specificity (sea-foam skin, crater glass). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
