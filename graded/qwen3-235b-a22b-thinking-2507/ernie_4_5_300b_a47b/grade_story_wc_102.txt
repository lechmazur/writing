<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (artist vs healer) embodied in micro-choices like tasting the tear and kneeling at the pool, but epiphany lacks sufficient struggle; "spiritually curious" label risks diagnostic-speak near-cliff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("love... waited for the right moment") with legible cost in "peace she had not known since the memory surfaced"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, though woods transition slightly unanchored at 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct's moss-slick path and glowing flowers constrain choices (breath reveals paths), charging the final image; "blossoms that shimmered like starlight" avoids overt symbolism by mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("where is unused love stored?") tightens through Lira’s breathing method narrowing options to follow the light trail; cost is felt in emotional surge at the pool, but internal conflict lacks physical escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spaces between breaths" reconfiguration avoiding moralizing; final image ("breath a steady rhythm, path illuminated") resonates non-literally with opening "soft edges and half-truths," rejecting symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "petals glowing faintly as if lit from within" filtered through camera obscura artist’s POV; tension in "bitter, then sweet, then gone" syntax modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor template cadence in "breath visible... vial labeled... memory surfaced" (−0.2); "half-truths" slightly stock, but final image’s "glow of unused love, finally found" achieves zero scaffold with high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of camera obscura art with spiritual quest feels inevitable; "unused love stored in pauses between thoughts" transforms familiar trope through specific breath mechanics, though "pilgrim of sparks" leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
