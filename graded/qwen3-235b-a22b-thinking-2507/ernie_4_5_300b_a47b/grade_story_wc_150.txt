<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; "cautious enchantment" stated but not embodied through conflicting choices during the harmonic tone climax. Micro-choices like speaking to trees reveal curiosity but omit visible tradeoffs with her stated caution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "faith as a choice" crystallizes with conceptual cost (breath catching, myrrh scent). Lens ambiguity weakens causality—Accumulative/Textural fits the sensory buildup, but the sundial's mechanical "key" framing implies Causal logic unresolved by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices: roots shift to reveal springs, coiling around ankles during descent. The sundial base charges the final image—villagers gather at its glow, making environment indispensable to closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lirael’s agency (aligning the sundial, rebuilding), but pressure lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens. The harmonic tone moment deepens meaning yet fails to narrow options—she "chooses to follow" without prior tactics-altering cost beyond breath catching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "faith as a choice" crystallizes via the sundial’s harmonic tone, not moralizing. Final line ("It’s not finished, but it’s enough") reweights restoration as communal process, avoiding sentimentality while charging prior solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots crunching over sun-bleached bones," roots "listening") shines, but stress compression falters—during the harmonic tone climax, "her breath catching" lacks the rhythmic urgency the moment demands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold dilutes momentum: "purposeful but unhurried, gathering stones, clearing debris, tracing the old paths" repeats intent without pressure. No closure-impacting artifacts, but "curiosity was a compass, caution a shield" verges on abstract telling in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora tropes through visceral specificity (orchard of bones, myrrh scent). Risk-taking succeeds—quiet closure with "not finished" shrine avoids resolution clichés—but "cautious enchantment" lacks the bold friction needed for 9.0+.</comment>
