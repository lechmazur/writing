<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic gift creates embodied emotion ("taste those memories—not with her tongue"), and contradictory impulses (clinging to gentle memories vs. pruning trauma) drive micro-choices. Final renunciation of the plant’s painful past is earned through prior cuts, with visible cost in her exhaustion ("chest heaving," "legs unsteady").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: the plant’s transformation crystallizes Elara’s causal choices (pruning = memory reshaping), with undeniable cost in her physical collapse. Lens (Causal) holds perfectly—"because/therefore" linkage tightens options as each cut narrows the plant’s path, and the violet light’s role is motivated by setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse functions as micro-setting: cracked glass filters the celestial light that directly enables the climax, and soil/pruning shears constrain choices (synaptic plasticity technique). Final image ("sculpture of light and life") charges the setting’s decay into rebirth, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each pruning cut narrows options (shedding trauma for hope), with visceral cost in trembling hands and gasping at memories. Dominant stake (rewiring the plant’s essence) tightens meaningfully as alignment peaks, forcing a trade-off between preserving pain and choosing beauty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "gentle rebellion" is shown via pruning choices, not stated. The final notebook ("planting seeds—not just knowledge fruit, but hope") reweights the central question without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through the transformed plant’s communal future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic descriptions ("taste those memories") and chef-specific diction ("pruning shears") create rhythmic control. Under pressure, diction compresses ("Not tonight," she murmured), avoiding uniformity. No head-hopping; voice modulates from tense to meditative as stakes rise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("her gentle rebellion against a world that had forgotten beauty" advances character/theme/setting). Final line recharges the opening graffiti without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during cuts ("She pruned again"), flowing during memory sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "rebirth" tropes through specific synesthetic mechanics (memory-tasting) and synaptic pruning. Fresh inflection: future visions instead of past trauma. Avoids safety middle by grounding hope in physical struggle ("first step is always hardest"), though "informally wise" trait lacks full integration.</comment>
