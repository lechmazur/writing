<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (oracle logic vs. embodied truth) drives micro-choices like smudging the illustration, but the herbalist resolution feels slightly convenient without deeper friction. Embodied emotion ("metallic tang of swallowed truth") avoids therapy-speak yet the fever's role in her transformation lacks sufficient causal groundwork for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the weight... anchored her" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (smudging, quarantine folder discovery), and auroral sorrow makes cost legible. No orientation debt; lens clarity by midpoint secures high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (smudging roots) and charges the final image with the herbalist. Mountain station’s crumbling reality pressures tactics, while aurora’s "sorrow" evolves from atmospheric detail to thematic carrier. Environment directly shapes the closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lirael’s agency: discovering the "QUARANTINE" folder deepens knowledge, narrowing options to departure. Dominant stake (truth vs. institutional lie) tightens through her smudging act, with visible cost in her role dissolution. Agency fulfills 9+ quick test but secondary stake (station stability) lacks sufficient interweaving for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bearberry’s reweighted meaning: "grows where the world shows its cracks" offers resonant, non-literal answer to truth’s burden. Avoids moralizing via the herbalist’s concrete wisdom, with complexity in truth being both anchor and fracture. Final image’s "felt whole" charges prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lirael notices "cracks in walls" and "wind’s howl like a question" through an oracle’s biased lens. Rhythmic control peaks in "aurora flickered, as if the sky itself were wincing," compressing stress without voice drift. Minor cadence repetition in reflection beats prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "smudged graphite" embodies her struggle. Final line’s "auroral sorrow... felt whole" avoids overwriting while charging closure. One slight abstraction ("certainties had begun to sway") prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle in peak beats maintains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "fault-tolerant oracle" with botanical resilience transforms tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, but "swaying certainties" concept slightly echoes familiar crisis-of-faith arcs without sufficient differentiation for 9.0. Emotional specificity in truth-as-anchor elevates.</comment>
