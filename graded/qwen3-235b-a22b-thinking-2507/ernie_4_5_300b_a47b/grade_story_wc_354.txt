<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "beauty in constraints" chess metaphor guiding his covenant interpretation; tears at sapling sprouting show earned endurance without tidy resolution. Flaw: "teeth ache" borders on bodily cliché but redeemed by concrete nexus vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands perfectly—the sapling's "fractured mirrors" crystallizes covenant's fragility with visible cost of exile and decades' labor. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "silence that speaks in stones" through hologram constellation chessboard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt stone constrains every choice: its dent shapes eclipse correlation, enables key insertion, and charges the final sapling. "Moss-crusted monolith" and magnetic pull aren't backdrop but active pressure—compasses spiraling dictates ritual timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation: silence's "weight of forgotten oaths" tightens to roaring nexus, narrowing options to the key insertion. Cost is visceral—Alaric's exile and tears—but "hopeful melancholy" slightly softens the earned price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess queen's diagonal path reweighted as "direction in brokenness," culminating in fractured-mirror sapling. No moralizing—final image answers "honor forgotten promises" through concrete correlation, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "translating silence" chess metaphor filters all observation. Tension in Lira's memory shows voice modulation under stress. Minor flaw: "tears pricking eyes" slightly generic but offset by "hopeful melancholy warming his chest."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "stardust coalescing into translucent mage" shows crystalline propulsion. "Twilight bled violet" risks purple prose but earns density through nexus hum "making teeth ache." Final line’s "quiet correlation" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes via cosmic stakes—queen's diagonal path reconfigured as shattered-star navigation. Emotional specificity in exile’s "deepened resolve" avoids generic melancholy. Risk: abstract covenant made visceral through stone’s dent.</comment>
