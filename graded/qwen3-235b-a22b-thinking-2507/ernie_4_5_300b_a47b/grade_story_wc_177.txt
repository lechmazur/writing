<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "precisely playful" trait remains label-heavy during climax; hologram's "you see cracks where light seeps" crosses into diagnostic speak (-0.4). Embodied contradiction weakens when epiphany merges foresight/hindsight too rationally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: spent storm's "lighter air" and emblem-as-compass crystallize decay/renewal cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through storm's pressure buildup. Minor deduction for hologram's thematic echo muddying cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker actively constrains choice (vines muffle sound yet storm penetrates) and charges final image with "walls softening into soil." Micro-setting (wafer seal's bergamot/iron scent) directly enables the climax's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why paths choose walkers") tightens meaningfully as storm breaks, but escalation lacks visceral cost during hologram beat. Conceptual price (accepting decay as seed) lands at dawn, yet tension deflates too neatly with storm's passage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Avoids moralizing through concrete particulars (wolf in glass maze, mismatched blocks), but "hands willing to interpret dreams" edges toward thematic echo. Final image reweights paths as "grown" with undeniable conceptual cost to directive's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientist-artist duality in "dissecting past while sketching possibilities") shines. Semicolon-heavy rhythm creates drumbeat cadence in reflective passages (-0.2), but lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax; "raindrops clung to lashes like diamonds" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor paraphrase loop: "decay and renewal" recurs with slight variation. No figurative muddle, but "fractals of symbol" risks purple prose (-0.1).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through ecological lens: paths "grown by hands" redefinition feels inevitable. "Wolf pacing glass maze" image synthesizes conflict with fresh specificity. Avoids safety-middle via bold decay/rebirth duality without redemption.</comment>
