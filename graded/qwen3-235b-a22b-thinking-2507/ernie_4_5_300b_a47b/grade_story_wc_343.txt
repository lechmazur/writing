<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s "diligently curious" trait manifests concretely in micro-choices (kneeling on cold floor, tracing patterns) with embodied cost when she ignores the captain’s order. Contradictory impulses—duty vs discovery—peak organically during the leap, avoiding label-speak. Jax’s skepticism-turned-support tests her stance without flattening his role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: Lira’s leap into the void (causal escalation from deciphering hopscotch/starlings) yields the luminance’s knowledge, with visible cost in the captain’s fury and her earned indifference. The Causal lens ("because she traced the squares, the starlings parted") holds unbroken from the phrasebook clue to the portal’s revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique airship’s copper hull and cargo hold aren’t backdrop but active constraints—the hopscotch board’s location enables discovery, the railing facilitates observation, and the void demands physical risk. The starlings’ shifting murmurations directly pressure Lira’s choices, charging the climax where their parted flight reveals the portal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from puzzle-solving (deciphering hopscotch) to life-risking action (the leap), with Lira’s agency narrowing options: obey the captain or pursue discovery. The cost—social rupture with authority, crystallized in "Lira didn’t care"—is felt in the final image, tightening the dominant stake (charting truth) without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment>The theme of curiosity as compass emerges implicitly through concrete actions (ink-stained fingers tracing constellations, ignoring the captain) rather than moralizing. The final image—Lira holding transformative knowledge while dismissing the captain—resonates as a non-literal answer to "what does discovery cost?" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature shines in map-focused noticing ("numbers aligned with constellations," "handwriting slanting like a storm front"), with rhythmic control under pressure: short, urgent phrases during the starlings’ parting ("There," she whispered). No head-hopping; Jax’s dialogue carries subtext through sparse, gruff exchanges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose avoids major loops but has minor scaffolding ("Her curiosity had always been her compass" slightly tells what showing demonstrates). Figurative language stays purposeful ("starlings screamed as if urging her on"), though "handwriting slanting like a storm front" edges toward cliché. Closure beat ("She’d charted... not just a place, but a truth") remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms the "curious apprentice" trope through profession-specific details (map apprentice using constellations, polyglot phrasebook). The hopscotch board as star map feels fresh, avoiding derivative portal tropes by tying mechanics to Lira’s skills. Emotional specificity—her indifference to the captain’s rage post-discovery—avoids generic triumph.</comment>
