<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") manifests in concrete micro-choices like smudging the cloth while researching; embodied emotion in "hollow space where purpose used to live" avoids label-speak. Gus lacks sufficient pressure to crystallize stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in "resurrecting forgotten stories," but the felt cost of Lenny's TV failure remains abstract. Accumulative lens holds via cloth's meaning accumulation, though orientation anchors weaken mid-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (grille cloth) constrains choices—Lenny’s research and call to bassist—and charges the final image as "talisman." Quarry’s "chasm of granite" mirrors emotional void without cliché, though appraisal tools lack integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when cloth reveals Echo Valley’s failure, forcing Lenny’s call. Agency-driven escalation works, but Gus’s "toss it" pressure lacks consequence; cost (emotional vulnerability) is felt but not visibly paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cloth’s evolution from "dish towel" to purpose-talisman. Final line reweights "after the applause" without moralizing, though secondary "confidently uncertain" thread dissipates pre-closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in roadie-lexicon ("Marshall stack," "toured vans") and rhythmic control during research beat. Minor register drift in "refused to be fact-checked" slightly dilutes POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, but template cadence ("He’d [verb]") in paragraph 3 and synonym churn ("reverence and frustration") trigger -0.4. Propulsion falters slightly in backstory block, though final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "relic rediscovery" trope via specific quarry/appraiser lens and Echo Valley’s obscure failure. Emotional specificity in "hollow space where purpose used to live" avoids genericity, though premise risks familiarity without cloth’s tactile integration.</comment>
