<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara's fear of lost language versus active hope, embodied via "breath caught" and micro-choices like humming to Elias. Flaw: her fear isn't sufficiently tested under pressure—she adapts too smoothly to building the choir without deeper struggle against her own doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the library sanctuary crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("across the unlearning hatred, they worked"). Accumulative lens holds—density increases as voices join, reweighting stakes through patterned escalation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The zither rosette constrains choice (Clara "denotes" via its spiral) and charges the final image ("rosette spun, a golden reminder"). Sensory details like "maple leaves skittered" and "dust motes" are purposefully filtered through Clara's urgency, avoiding generic autumn clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Clara's agency: inviting others deepens the "unlearning hatred" stake into collective action, narrowing options to "subtracting noise." Cost is unmistakable—"gathering dust since riots" and neighbors' complaints show tangible cultural erosion altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the river song ("flows through three countries, no one knows who wrote it"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights cultural loss into hope ("something new could take root") without stating a moral, using concrete particulars to charge resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices "traveled stillness" and "melted honey" voice. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in Elias's fragmented dialogue ("patchwork of memory and hope") versus Clara's lyrical urgency ("Play it"), with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("A knock shattered the air" vs. lyrical density). Minor abstraction in "language of the soul" is redeemed by concrete action, but high-pressure beats avoid figurative muddle—closure image ("rosette spun") crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "vanishing arts" trope via specific instruments (zither/hurdy-gurdy) and emotional truth in Elias's grandfather (hated city but played nightly). Fresh synthesis: harmony as "holding conflict gently" feels inevitable through prior particulars, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
