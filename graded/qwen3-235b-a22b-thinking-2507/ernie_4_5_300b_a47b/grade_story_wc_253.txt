<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation (cultivating lightness through craft) is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices like sanding edges revealing contradictory impulses. However, emotional progression feels slightly abstract during peak beats; "grief is like these flowers" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the remade hush... thick with unspoken words" crystallizes endurance under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by 80 words, but the cost of grief's transformation ("faint stain on fingertips") lacks visceral intensity to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The spoon (tool) constrains every choice and charges the final image—"turning it in her hands" reweights the mandate's void. Wind turbines evolve from backdrop to resource (scrap wood), though "old bone" planks verge on cliché without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lirael's whittling ritual under Accumulative pressure, with the disintegrating bouquet embodying the cost of preserving grief. Agency is clear, but the mandate's enforcement feels distant; the cost needs sharper tactical consequences beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spoon's "flaws and all" beauty versus crumbling flowers, avoiding moralizing. Yet "Lightness is not the absence of darkness" borders on thematic echo in the final paragraph, slightly undermining earned resonance with near-prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in wood-grain tracing and turbine-shadow choreography. Minor register drift in "polishing is an act of defiance" slightly fractures voice during high-pressure beats, though rhythmic control remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("petals crumbled... scattering like ash") with zero loops, but "hollow laughter" and "polishing is an act of defiance" contain stock phrasing that dulls closure's edge. Final image propulsion is immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through the whittling ritual's specificity—the spoon's "shallow enough to see the bottom" redefines resistance. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though the mandate's enforcement lacks fresh inflection beyond standard grief-prohibition.</comment>
