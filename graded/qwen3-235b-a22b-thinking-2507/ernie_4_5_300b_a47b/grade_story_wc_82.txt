<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied grief ("polishing wounds into gems"), but brother's absence limits relationship crucible. Micro-choices like holding the lantern to the shadow reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. No therapy-speak despite high emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "I see you" crystallizes stance against shadow with felt cost (trembling fingers), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure tightens via gem's reflection and shadow's return. Cost proof clear in "dissolved into mist" moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (gem/polishing cloth) constrains choice and charges closure. Bioluminescent moss and tea cups shape tactics—fragments become ascending stars. Sensory details filtered through lantern maker's grief (lavender smoke as regret).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (facing shadow/grief) tightens via gem's reflection and shadow's return. Agency in transformation choice ("fold this moment into a crane") forecloses avoidance path. Cost legible in "heart a knot of ache and awe" during memory cascade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "folding grief" motif: origami cranes unraveling vs. lanterns holding light. Final image (cranes flying toward spires) reweights "carry the old into the new" without moralizing. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "facets catching twilight like captured stars" mirrors her lens on grief. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences when shadow returns. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "polish until stone weeps."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shards of light that spiraled into the sky" does triple duty (action/atmosphere/theme). Figurative language precise ("laughter, brittle as winter ice"). Final line's "dull and pitted" recharges opening gem imagery with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "folding" physics (descends while ascending) and dream-recording mechanics. Emotional specificity in "wry and warm" brother's smile avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
