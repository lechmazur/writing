<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction remains alternating summaries ("father said X, mother said Y") rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in action; final choice lacks sufficient causal buildup from prior micro-choices despite strong embodied emotion in flame plunge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with undeniable cost in "carried that sentiment like a shield," but orientation anchors (waterfall/orchard) slightly delayed past 120 words, narrowly avoiding penalty; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through starling pattern density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dew crystal) constrains choices and charges final image when warm to touch, but kaleidoscopic waterfall remains atmospheric ornament without tactical constraint—environment fails 9+ gate despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (harmonizing logic/intuition) signaled early with one meaningful deepening via starling patterns, but escalation relies on external revelation (bird dance) rather than protagonist agency; cost legible in final sentiment-as-shield realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal/starling motif reweighting without moralizing; final footprint spiral offers resonant answer to "touch of wonder," though "key to what came next" borders on thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist’s sensory precision) modulates rhythm under pressure; free indirect style clean with consistent psychic distance, though minor register drift in "resonate with the pulse of the earth itself" slightly over-abstracts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop in opening ("hummed... vibration that resonated") triggers -0.2; syntactic variety supports propulsion despite one participle simultaneity error ("casting fractured light over her workbench").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Ancient freshness" tone synthesizes tropes through specific verifiable details (crushed nightshade ink, charred fingertips tracing patterns), but alchemist archetype lacks transformative risk beyond expected emotional arc.</comment>
