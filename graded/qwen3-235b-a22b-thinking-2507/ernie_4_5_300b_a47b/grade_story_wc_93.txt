<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "curse twisting the promise into a knot" and embodied choices like theta-rock adjustment under vision-fracture pressure; no diagnostic labels despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost ("tears mingling with salt spray") under Accumulative lens; density surge from Fibonacci to Möbius sequences reweights stakes through pattern breaks without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains choice via frictionless water dictating eel movement; aurora's "bruise-purple" shift charges the final image by mirroring emotional cost of understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through rock-sequence escalation (Fibonacci→Pascal→Möbius) driven by Lira's agency; visible cost in vision-fracture terror and final tears forecloses control-for-witnessing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sacred patterns" reweighting from puzzle to language; final image ("learned to listen") avoids moralizing by charging prior material through eel-sigil action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sand bleeding colors" and "star dust screamed"; rhythmic compression during vision-fracture ("The storm returned, a howling void") taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "liquid green" aurora metaphor sustains coherence through "bruise-purple" shift; high-density propulsion ("hands flew, reordering rocks") in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical spirituality via eel geometries; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making "borrowed dawn" specificity inevitable.</comment>
