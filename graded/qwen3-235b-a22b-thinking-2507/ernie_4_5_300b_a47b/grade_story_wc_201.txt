<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seeking formula vs accepting uncertainty) manifest in "brace" micro-choices; embodied trauma avoids therapy-speak. Final endurance feels earned but woman's intervention slightly undermines causality of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (strap biting palm during "bracing"), but cost proof at ending lacks concrete image—hovers between conceptual/emotional. Accumulative lens holds through UV spore escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV forest functions as micro-setting: spores burn skin (constraining choice), bioluminescent bark syncs pulse (charging final image). Recurring strap elevates to 9-band via closure linkage—clasped during hopeful walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias' agency ("learn to measure unmeasurable"), but UV penance pressure lacks tactical cost—spores burn but don't alter movement. Woman's dialogue resolves tension without sufficient earned friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mathematics of mercy" reweighted as endurance question, not formula. Final image ("steps sure... mind clearer") avoids moralizing but "forgiveness halo" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("UV light flaring where skin met air") with rhythmic control under stress. Proprioception descriptions modulate voice effectively; no head-hopping despite experimental compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops but "proprioceptive enhancements" label repeats without fresh embodiment in beat 3. Strap's "edges biting" provides crucial closure texture, though "ultraviolet penance" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via specific bioluminescent forest logic and "mathematics of mercy" reframing. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes but "teeth glinting like pewter" borders on derivative.</comment>
