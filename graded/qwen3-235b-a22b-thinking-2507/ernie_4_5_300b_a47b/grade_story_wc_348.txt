<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (equations vs. music as grief responses), embodied via river foam observation. Micro-choices under pressure: texting back, humming bassline. Mara’s thinner characterization slightly limits relationship crucible depth despite credible friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: chrysalis release crystallizes divergence-as-bridge with visible cost (months of silence overcome). Accumulative lens holds—foam patterns intensify pressure toward earned stance crystallization. No orientation debt; cost proof clear in "space to breathe... harmonize."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains choice (wading deeper for insight) and charges final image (rivers flowing toward shared horizon). Recurring chrysalis evolves from pocket weight to released vessel. Micro-setting (test tube, mossy crevice) reflects chemist’s POV bias without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-induced silence) tightens through chrysalis discovery → foam insight → text reply. Agency-driven escalation: "loosened grief" enables typing "On my way," foreclosing avoidance path. Cost legible in studio tension ("posture tense," shaky harmony).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: river foam dissolving/reforming reweights separation as connection. Final image ("separate streams flowing toward shared horizon") answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—insights earned through test tube observation, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: chemist’s "surfactants... temporary unity" lens. Voice modulates under pressure (short phrases: "Symmetry in chaos"). Dialogue subtext-rich ("Afraid to finish the song"). Slight convergence in final harmony description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("froth where two currents collided" conveys setting/emotion). Final line cadence perfect: "alive. And that, she thought, was enough." Minor overwriting in "symphonically minded" repetition (para 2 & 5) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer chemistry + river dynamics reframes grief as collaborative divergence. Emotional specificity avoids templates ("hollow space where sister’s laughter used to be"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via foam pattern motif.</comment>
