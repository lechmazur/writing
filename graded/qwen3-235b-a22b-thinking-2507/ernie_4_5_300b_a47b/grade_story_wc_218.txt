<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brazen calm" amid mortality, but spirit dialogue's "You build walls/we build boxes" edges toward thematic echo rather than pure character voice, slightly diluting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: her death crystallizes the cost ("time stretch thin as copper wire"), while the Accumulative lens holds through sensory density culminating in the wire-stone connection’s golden light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple orchard actively constrains choices—the rumbling ground forces her "Almost there" urgency—and the oak’s final "branches cradling the sky" charges the closure image with irreversible transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening resonance: the spirit’s "It hurts" reweights the dominant harmony goal, and her life ("six months left") is the visible cost crystallized in the final breath "soft as copper on oak".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action—the wire’s tightening and seed cracking avoid moralizing—but early "fostering interspecies respect" risks slight telliness, narrowly missing the 9+ resonance gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("gnarled oak," "roots entwined with copper") and rhythmic compression ("Lira froze. The spirits...") under pressure create a distinct voice; "brazen calm" modulates perfectly to her final shrug.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "copper on oak" reprise in the final line achieves high-density closure. Minor comma splice ("her tone brazen calm") is stylistic and unobtrusive, preserving flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via botanical engineering (copper as conductor), but "fostering respect" motivation lacks the gritty specificity needed for 9+; emotional truth in "Where would I go?" elevates risk-taking.</comment>
