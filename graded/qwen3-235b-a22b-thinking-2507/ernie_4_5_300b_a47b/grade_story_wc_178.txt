<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's frugality-as-armor clashing with her quest for metaphysical answers; the gasp at seeing her face etched into the tile crystallizes embodied cost. Micro-choices like brushing sand from the panel reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the tile dissolving into a mirror reweights the covenant's meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("her frugality, her skepticism, her grief—all were etched"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through bioluminescent revelation to final "Asharu" charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tile functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (recessed panel placement) and charges the final image (her face on the grid). Some ornamental descriptions ("sky streaked with amber/violet") lack tactical pressure, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: arranging tiles transforms "encrypted devotion" into self-covenant with felt cost. The rumble-to-bioluminescence escalation forecloses external answers, making the conceptual cost ("tile offered only questions") unmistakable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tile's evolving meaning—no moralizing, just the final "Asharu" refracting "curiosity" into binding. Avoids thematic echo; the covenant-with-self resolution reweights "void's indifference" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct astronomer perceptual signature ("star-chart eyes," "dusky harmony") modulates rhythm under stress ("chamber shuddered"). Minor deduction: voice stays uniformly lyrical during rumble, missing compression typical of peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("dissolved," "clutched"). One hairline slip: "sandstone arches framing a sky streaked with amber/violet" slightly overwrites in calm moment, but closure beat ("edges biting into her palm") stays lean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artifact" trope via astronomer's lens: tile as empirical mirror refracting intention. Risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "encrypted devotion" feels inevitable through prior causality.</comment>
