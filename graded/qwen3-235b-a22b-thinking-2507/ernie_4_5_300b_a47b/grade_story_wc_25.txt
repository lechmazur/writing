<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete details (trembling hands, ozone taste) but motivation lacks friction; "prove whispers travel farther" stated but not dramatized as competing impulse against urgency or fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with storm intensifying pressure, but key discovery feels coincidental (no causal link to Libra symbol); Charged Poise closure lands cleanly with "labyrinth didn’t need maps. It needed whispers" carrying conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (shifting paths, metal echoes) and charge final image; zodiac coin as micro-setting dictates action at Libra symbol, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating labyrinth) tightens via storm's escalating interference, but "double pay" challenge lacks visceral cost; whispers vs. shouts dichotomy deepens knowledge without sufficient tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action ("hummed a tune" vs. shouted directions), with final line reweighting "whispers" as non-literal answer to labyrinth's sentience; zero moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted like ozone," map creases "sharp as knife cuts") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift with "geomagnetic storm" jarring for blue-collar POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("static hum," "slammed like thunder") with propulsion. Final line ("door opened") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentient labyrinth trope transformed through specific "walks" mechanic and shipping-container setting; whisper motif avoids cliché by tying to occupational reality (sound propagation in metal maze).</comment>
