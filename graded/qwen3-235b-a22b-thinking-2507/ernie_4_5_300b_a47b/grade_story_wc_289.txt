<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lila’s hollow heart versus her ghostwriting craft, embodied through trembling hands and chest tightness. Elara’s archetypal presence slightly flattens relationship dynamics, but Lila’s micro-choice to write her secret reveals authentic value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: twig spiral to sinking orbs builds density toward Charged Poise closure. Cost—abandoning lifelong emotional hiding—is legible in her tears and altered resolve. Minor friction in art installation transition barely dents escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lotus pond actively constrains choices (sinking orbs dictate timing) and charges final image with "liquid light" ripples. "Prismatic quiet" evolves from sensory detail to thematic heartbeat, avoiding symbolism clichés through tactile integration with Lila’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila’s agency: touching the spiral, writing her secret, watching orbs sink. The felt cost—years of hollow connection—narrows options toward speaking truths aloud. Elara’s guidance slightly softens pressure, but the core tension remains viscerally personal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (writing secret, orbs dissolving) not moralizing. Final image of thrush song as "melody of prismatic quiet" reweights the "thread" concept without stating it. Elara’s "courage to share" risks thematic echo but is earned by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "marble curves catching sun’s aftermath" and "chestnut feathers gleaming." Rhythmic control falters slightly in "inevitably whimsical" descriptor, but compression of emotional beats maintains voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with "orb glowed faintly, as if acknowledging her truth" doing triple duty. Minor overwriting in "prismatic quiet" repetitions, but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line’s lyrical echo elevates rather than repeats, avoiding scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghostwriter profession transforms spiritual-journey tropes through specific emotional calculus. The thrush’s nest spiral—a fresh inflection of "keeper" symbolism—feels inevitable in hindsight. Avoids derivative safety by grounding epiphany in public art mechanics.</comment>
