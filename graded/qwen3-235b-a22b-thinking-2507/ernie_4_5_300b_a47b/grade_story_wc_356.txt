<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s ambition/patience contradiction manifests in micro-choices (soil adjustments, doodle evolution), but elders remain off-page voices without tangible pressure. Embodied emotion shines via "doodles growing jagged" yet skepticism lacks specific on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("chaos and serenity are not enemies but kin"), but the dream sequence feels convenient rather than earned causality. Orientation anchors clear by 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through scent-density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (scent shifts, lantern light) vividly filter through Lira’s herbalist POV, yet the treetop village functions as atmosphere rather than constraint. Corpse flower’s scent narrowly qualifies as micro-setting charging the final image but doesn’t alter mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally through scent/doodle evolution, with elders’ skepticism creating credible secondary pressure. However, their opposition resolves off-page without testing Lira’s agency—cost (humility) lands only at bloom, weakening escalation’s causal weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through corpse flower growth and doodle motifs, avoiding moralizing. But "undercurrent of wisdom" phrasing borders on thematic echo, slightly undermining the resonant final image where elders’ admission reweights chaos/serenity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("olfactorily sensitive nose," scent-driven observations) sustains voice under pressure. Minor register drift in "tide’s thought" abstracts the herbalist’s concrete lexicon, but rhythmic control (e.g., "Weeks passed. The seed remained dormant") elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured, with scaffold ("reminder of the undercurrent...") only in low-pressure beats. Final line integrates "wildflower hush" perfectly, but "doodled on the wrapping paper of her heart" risks sentimentality—saved by earned context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower trope via scent-guided growth and journaling, avoiding safety middle with elders’ skepticism. Treetop village leans generic, yet emotional specificity in ambition/patience tension elevates beyond template.</comment>
