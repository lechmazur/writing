<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied patience/impatience conflict through filing resets and physical strain; "softly purposeful" trait earns credibility via micro-choices. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses beyond surface calm/haste tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: viaduct's hum becoming "lullaby" crystallizes reorientation with visible cost (Kael's exhaustion, elders' arrival). Accumulative lens holds through filing patterns and lunar refraction tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake's thickness and viaduct's vibrations directly constrain Kael's actions (thaw deadline, magnetic sensitivity). Basalt sanctuary's sound absorption shapes pacing—environment charges final image where hum persists through spring thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aligning moon/viaduct) tightens via filing failures and physical strain; cost is Kael's transformed patience. Escalation is protagonist-driven (resetting filings, adjusting degrees) but lacks a live option foreclosure beyond initial failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: filings coiling/spiraling reweights "patient revolution" without moralizing. Final image (hum enduring thaw) resonates non-literally—though elder dialogue risks thematic echo, it's tempered by Kael's weary silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in magnetic/vision details ("iron filings trembled... in anticipation"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during filing reset ("Kael cursed softly, his breath a puff of steam") contrast lyrical moon-path descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractal patterns onto the viaduct’s surface" fuses setting/action). Minor overwriting risk in "shadowed sentinel" metaphor, but viaduct's "heartbeat" vibration stays grounded in tactile detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet revolution" trope through magnetic mechanics and lunar refraction specificity. Emotional truth in Kael's calloused-to-steady hands avoids abstraction; basalt/frost setting anchors universals without genericism.</comment>
