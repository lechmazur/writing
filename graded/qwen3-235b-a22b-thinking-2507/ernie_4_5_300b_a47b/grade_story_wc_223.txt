<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mimic grief so well she’d begun to forget where art ended," but "benevolently ruthless" label lacks embodied demonstration until climax. Final pawn realization earns change with visceral scar ache as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "pawns weren’t gone—they’d been her" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (scars aching). Accumulative lens holds through whisper-density escalation to the king’s soft click.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery’s acoustics constrain choice (amplified footsteps) and charge closure ("luminous absence"). Pawnless chessboard functions as micro-setting that physically shapes the final reconfiguration beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when king topples, forcing realization that pawns "were her" with visible cost. But interregnum timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; "liminal period" remains atmospheric rather than tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete chess metaphor: "history wasn’t written by kings... but by pawns who dared to move." Final image reweights premise without moralizing, making conceptual cost undeniable through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("sound curled like smoke," scars "aching faintly"), but "benevolently ruthless" momentarily slips into narrator intrusion. Rhythmic control modulates perfectly with pressure shifts in walking sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-duplicate metaphors ("whispers grew louder"/"luminous absence") create minor density muddle in high-pressure beats. Otherwise zero loops, with "soft click" demonstrating crystalline propulsion at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms chess trope through crisis actor lens: pawns as "small, unnamed actors" reframes historical agency. Risk-taking with abstract "nomadic penumbra" pays off through concrete bodily cost (scars) at closure.</comment>
