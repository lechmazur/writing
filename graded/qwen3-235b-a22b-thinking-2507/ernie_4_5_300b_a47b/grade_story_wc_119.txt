<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elara's restlessness vs. controlled craft; embodied choices (clutching specs, trembling hands) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight motivation shift lacks deeper prior contradiction, though final cookie-sealing micro-choice charges cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("the flow had begun"); Accumulative lens holds through density shift in letters' revelation. Orientation anchors lighthouse/storm by 50 words; microdot specs drive causality without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lantern beam and microdot specs function as micro-setting constraining choices (tunnel navigation, belt-tucking); storm evolves causally with action. Final flare image charges closure through tool reprise. Ash-dusted desk subtly mirrors internal revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through letters' revelation narrowing options to "finish what father started," with conceptual cost in "flow becomes flood" warning. Agency in cookie-writing choice is clear, though escalation leans slightly on discovered documents rather than pure protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("tide erases footprints," locked door hum"), not abstraction. Final image reweights "open secrets" via dockworker's action without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "game was afoot" phrasing landing as earned gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "spycraft microdot specs disguised as tea-stained recipe cards"; rhythm modulates from steady ("heartbeat") to fragmented ("A door creaked open"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during letter revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "silver blade" cliché is lone artifact. High density: "dipped her brush into a jar of ink" conveys craft/storm tension. Final line’s "hands steady once more" recharges opening motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through fortune-cookie medium; emotional truth in "accidentally prophetic" self-doubt. Fresh synthesis of Cold War legacy with domestic craft feels inevitable. Risk-taking (microdots as recipe cards) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
