<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation to defy conformity, but interior contradiction lacks embodied tension; "bodily poetic" trait remains abstract label without visceral tradeoffs during the dance climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (ongoing hum of conformity), though cost proof at the final image lacks concrete physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Snow and sanctuary create vivid atmosphere, but environment fails to constrain choices—dancing succeeds without environmental friction, missing 9+ gate requirement for setting to alter tactics or charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (defying conformity) escalate through dance intensity under Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract; the "humming lullaby" lacks tangible consequence beyond thematic resonance, weakening escalation’s visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges organically through "harvest of echoes," with final image reweighting defiance as portable symphony; avoids moralizing but slightly over-relies on light/sound metaphors without deeper human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with sensory specificity, but "bodily poetic movements could unravel the very air" drifts into abstract register under pressure, diluting POV coherence during the pivotal dance sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Beautiful cadence overall, but adjacent lines loop "snowflake" imagery ("each flake fell like a whispered secret"/"testament to quiet defiance"), triggering paraphrase redundancy in high-pressure beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light/memory metaphors elevates artistic resistance trope; "chaste courtesan" angle lacks transformation beyond poetic label, preventing full risk distinction despite strong emotional specificity in closure.</comment>
