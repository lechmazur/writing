<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; Kael’s internal struggle remains abstract ("twinge of sadness" without embodied trade-offs). Motivation clear but cost underdeveloped—his purpose feels achieved without tangible sacrifice beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (silence-mapping mechanics feel invented mid-scene). Cost ("joy would fade") legible yet emotionally distant; Earned Stasis lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor constrains choice (Kael adapts to wave rhythms) and charges final image (dawn erasing music). Camera’s physicality underutilized, but moonlight-as-canvas motif reweights silence with conceptual cost in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Lira’s participation (silence→collective vulnerability), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cost remains observational ("twinge of sadness") rather than altering Kael’s tactics or future choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final image ("silence had spoken") reweights silence as canvas without moralizing. Fisherman’s plea crystallizes conceptual cost, though "joyful sorrow" label risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in harbor descriptions, but POV leaks during climax ("violin weeping and laughing" exceeds Kael’s observable reality). Stress-response syntax lacks degradation—tension flattened by lyrical uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("as Kael’s signs grew... as the music intertwined...") dulls immediacy. "Joyful sorrow" is therapy-speak; metaphor strain when waves "respond" to signing violates physical logic in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language/music avoids trope clichés, but "lonely artist transforms town" framework lacks bold risk. Camera’s filmless truth-telling elevates premise, yet emotional specificity doesn’t transcend familiar archetypes.</comment>
