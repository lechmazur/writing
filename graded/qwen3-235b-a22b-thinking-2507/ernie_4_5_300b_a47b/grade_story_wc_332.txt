<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite vivid setup; the epiphany lacks embodied contradiction or struggle, making the final choice feel frictionless rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "palette empty but heart full" crystallizes the cost of dissolving the dream into self, with the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through refracted light accumulation to vitalization climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and palette function as micro-setting that charges the final image; salt on skin and light-pulse details constrain choices and embody the theme of transience with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through light accumulation, but escalation relies on dream agency ("you’ve been chasing me") rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the cost of dissolution feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid in the vitalization beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from light/salt motifs; the final image reweights "cipher of longing" as self-acceptance without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete sensory resolution ("salt on her skin").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "light behaved oddly, pooling like liquid gold"; rhythmic control modulates perfectly from lyrical calm to feverish vitalization, with elision taught early via "hush of improbable beginnings" refrain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "her method was precise" slows propulsion; otherwise, zero loops with high density—"trembled, and the air hummed" compresses action, image, and consequence without muddying the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chasing dreams" trope through light-vitalization mechanics; the archipelago’s breath dissolving into soul-particles feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding abstraction with salt/skin specificity.</comment>
