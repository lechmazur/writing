<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s embodied stress ("sweat trickling") and "Trust" mantra, but the mother’s legacy motivation edges toward told abstraction during the buckle adjustment climax, slightly diluting the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visceral cost (physical exhaustion, "work never done"), but the parachute buckle’s "key" function lacks early causal grounding—its binary-switch resolution feels slightly convenient despite the muscle-memory setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parachute buckle and bioluminescent nodes constrain every choice, charging the final image ("buckle warm in his palm"); however, Q2’s 8.7 score caps this category per cross-gate rules despite the setting’s flawless integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern disruptions narrowing Kael’s options, but the lunar-phase deadline lacks tightening pressure after introduction—the "dawn" resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won under Accumulative lens demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "Trust" evolving into language, avoiding moralizing; the capped score reflects Q2’s insufficiency for 9.0+ eligibility, though the final image’s covenant redefinition perfectly reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath fogging the glow," fractal light) modulates under pressure, but "soundless echo" repetition creates minor scaffold in high-tension beats, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, yet "muscle memory" recurs three times with paraphrase loops ("revised the patterns"/"revised its code"), and weak nominalizations ("a kind of poetry") sap propulsion in critical revision sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "pattern seeker" mechanics with parachute physics feels inevitable, but the nocturnal arbor’s bioluminescence leans on familiar mystical-forest tropes without sufficient transformational grit to breach 8.8.</comment>
