<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (scholar vs. activist) but pheromone test lacks struggle; "pulse quickened" generic. Final choice earned through garden plotting, though initiation feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: moth swarm → living arrow → fractal shadows creates pattern cascade. Charged Poise closure crystallizes with "warp has just begun" and humming moths' undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse isn't backdrop but tactical resource (orchids trigger swarm, Mabel taps rhythm). Seed's fractal shadows charge final image, though soil glow arrives late for full 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (proving worth) tightens through Elias's agency: garden proposal → pheromone test → seed activation. Cost legible in humming moths' pressure during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "RESIST" mosaic embodies resistance without stating it. Final image reweights "covert alphabets" as luminous defiance, though "after thoughts taxable" quote skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice consistent from "ink-stained fingers" to quoting self. Compression maintains momentum ("sprinted... uncorked"), though "pulse quickened" dilutes Elias' distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "sweet, musky scent" feels checklist-y. "Living arrow" phrase achieves high density; minor overwriting ("chaos converged into symphony") barely touches climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes via lepidoptery: gourd seed as Class-3 disruptor, Fibonacci bean rows. Risk of quiet closure pays off through soil's bioluminescent charge against surveillance.</comment>
