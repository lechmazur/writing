<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow's contradictory impulses (silence vs family tradition) act simultaneously in scene; final poem choice earns shift from isolation to connection with visible cost (faded ribbon). Embodied emotion avoids labels—chisel-calloused hands, ribbon's rough texture convey grief without abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: lantern flare/dim reweights grief's meaning with felt cost (ribbon's faded vibrancy). Accumulative lens holds—butterfly swarm intensifies pressure, narrowing Marlow's options to speak or remain silent. Cost legible in "faded but still vibrant" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (glass rattles, lantern glow shifts tactics) and charges closure—final "prison and sanctuary" realization hinges on its physicality. Micro-setting (ribbon's color shifts in lantern light) reweights grief's meaning. Body/tool integration (chisel-calloused hands handling ribbon) elevates beyond description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marlow's agency under Accumulative lens: butterfly migration forces crystallization of stance. Dominant stake (unspoken grief vs tradition) tightens meaningfully—his poem reading forecloses isolation path with visible cost (emotional exposure, ribbon's fading). Coincidence (migration) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—ribbon's color shifts, butterfly-wing shadows—not abstraction. Final poem reweights premise ("grief is a door") without moralizing; "faded but still vibrant" offers resonant answer to "shape of collective grief." Avoids thematic echo; no final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "brittle leaves," "thundering calm," "living embers" through carver's tactile lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during voice encounter ("Marlow turned, but saw only empty air"), flowing cadence for ancestral stories. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("damp earth and forgotten roses" conveys setting/theme/emotion). Propulsion through strong verbs ("rattled," "swirled," "spill") without figurative muddle. Final line crystallizes theme with textural specificity ("flight lingered in his bones")—no sentimentality or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief as "bridge" reframed through gravestone carving + butterfly migration. Specific verifiable detail (medicinal herbs, chisel-calloused hands) avoids trope. Risk-taking in quiet Accumulative structure pays off—closure hinges on emotional specificity, not plot mechanics. Transformation test passed: wouldn't work with generic "artist" protagonist.</comment>
