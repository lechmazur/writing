<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete details ("numbness replaced grief," parasol tip as fragile anchor) avoids abstraction; contradictory impulses act in rescue scene. Slight deduction for "fold in patience" phrasing bordering on diagnostic label-speak in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("flicker of something like peace" against ongoing grief). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory accumulation (ice groans, keening sound) tightens pressure toward crystallized stance. No orientation debt; lens named by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as active micro-setting: cold numbs toes (constrains action), ice fissure enables rescue (charges closure). Parasol tip’s fragility directly shapes tactics (hooking boat railing) and final image. Environment’s tactile specificity (frayed wool gloves, groaning hull) elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila’s agency: "trawl" action leads to hearing the keening sound, her decisive lowering of the parasol tip forecloses passive waiting. Cost legible in "flicker of something like peace" against her unchanged grief—visible tradeoff where rescue doesn’t cure but reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: parasol tip’s evolution from sentimental relic to rescue tool reframes "final tranquility" as active endurance. Final image ("flicker of something like peace") offers non-literal answer to "sound of approaching endings" without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lila notices "skeletal network of docks," "wind through a cracked bell," reflecting her detached state. Rhythm modulates effectively—longer sentences during reflection, staccato during rescue ("Help me pull"). Slight register drift in "fold in patience" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose excels in textural specificity ("ice-encrusted boats," "groaning hull") but "fold in patience" explanation reads as scaffold in high-pressure beat, dulling immediacy. No loops or metaphors muddle closure; final line’s "flicker" crystallizes meaning with precise diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: euthanasia tourist trope transformed via disaster relief context and parasol tip’s functional symbolism. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—rescue feels earned through sensory accumulation, not causal convenience. Fresh inflection in "fold" redefined as action, not waiting.</comment>
