<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride’s contradictory impulses (loving/venomous) drive choices under pressure, but Elara’s interiority lacks depth; micro-choices like placing the bead show value hierarchy with cost ("trembling, held the bead aloft").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visceral cost in dissolution imagery; causal chain holds ("placed the bead... fruit split open"), though "debt paid in understanding" feels slightly abstract versus concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choice (bead must interact with fruit within its walls), evolving from prison to sanctuary; stone bead as micro-setting charges final image, but "threads of a thousand funerals" edges toward ornamental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when bead placement triggers awakening ("hum intensified... shook the glass"), narrowing options to dissolution; cost is legible in ghost’s dissolution, though escalation relies slightly on Elara’s passive discovery versus active agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "love and venom coexist" realization in final line; avoids moralizing by grounding wisdom in concrete particulars (bead’s wear, ghost’s laughter), reweighting debt as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures (ghost notices cold air as "silent hymn," Elara focuses on workbench) with rhythmic control; POV shift from ghost to Elara is intentional and stable under pressure, avoiding convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "shrouded in endless night, where frost clung..." opens with slight overwriting; final line ("laughter lingered—a sound of mournful elation") achieves resonant propulsion without closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via specific logic (meteorite bead, resonant awakenings); emotional complexity in ghost’s vengeance/duty avoids safety middle, though winter-cracked fields timeframe lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
