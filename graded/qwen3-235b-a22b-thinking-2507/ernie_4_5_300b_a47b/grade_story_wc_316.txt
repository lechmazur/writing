<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("wildfire" motivation vs. clinging to identity) drive the custody battle climax. Clone confrontation reveals Kael's fear of obsolescence through embodied choices like the "feral" grin and merging energy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Kael's harmonization choice ("dance of opposing energies") directly causes clone dissolution. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost—"emotions raw but real" and brain's "dimmed but steady" light reconfigure identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo constrains choice: cracks spiderweb under energy channeling, forcing Kael's descent. Worn boots' wind howling embodies emotional fragility that charges the final "alive" descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity autonomy) tightens via clone's "obsolete" taunt forcing Kael's "vivify" gambit. Cost legible in brain's dimmed light and raw emotions, but custody battle mechanics lack mid-scene tactical trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"You're a choice" final line reweights autonomy theme through concrete action, avoiding moralizing. Emotional reawakening as "dormant volcano" earns thematic resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "clouds shifting like liquid as history rewrote itself" filters reality through Kael's fractured psyche. Rhythmic control during battle ("fire and ice, light and shadow") modulates intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, but "emotional numbness that had haunted him" risks therapy-speak. "Slicing through pretense like a knife through butter" elevates tension with precise texture in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope through emotional stakes: custody battle centers on psychological autonomy, not physical replacement. "Complementary opposites" mechanic feels inevitable via dojo's fire/ice duality.</comment>
