<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction ("hands steady" vs. "desperate need") and micro-choice to release the wing earn the closure. Lacks competing impulses beyond curiosity, slightly muting the final renunciation's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the wing's vanishing crystallizes Lin's transformed existence ("quiet explosions in everyday moments"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sun-trail pattern, and the valley mist burning away charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The morpho wing functions as micro-setting, constraining Lin's choice to release it and charging the closure ("lesson remained—a flicker of iridescent caution"). Sun's movement actively guides her through the tea house, evolving with the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding narrative magnetism) tighten through Lin's agency observing patrons and releasing the wing, but escalation lacks sufficient friction; her transition to illuminator feels inevitable without visible trade-offs beyond the wing's loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (wing's iridescence, patrons' shared understanding), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "invisible threads" into action without stating a moral, though "some hearts are built to hold them" flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light fractured and reformed," "cobalt to violet to blinding white") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control falters slightly in "dazzling arc" description where cadence becomes decorative rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" functions as label-speak in a peak beat, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise, high density with purposeful variation; "stolen secret" metaphor avoids cliché by anchoring to Lin's tactile relationship with the vial.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of organ transplant metaphor with narrative theory avoids magical realism tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, but "donor heart" premise edges close to derivative without deeper transformation of the trope.</comment>
