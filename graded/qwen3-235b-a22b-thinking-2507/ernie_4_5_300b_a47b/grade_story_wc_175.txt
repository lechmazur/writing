<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but epiphany edges toward thematic echo; "purpose" realization lacks contradictory impulses in closure beat. Strong embodied emotion via trembling hands and aching fingers sustains authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens—dissolving lattice embodies transience with felt cost. Midpoint lens ambiguity ("transiently rooted" concept underutilized as pressure) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active micro-setting: moss sinks knees, silk constrains fingers, light fades to charge final image. "Peach and lavender" clouds directly alter Lirael’s weaving tactics—environment shapes every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: trembling hands knotting silk under time pressure (monarch’s arrival) forecloses permanence. Cost legible in lattice’s dissolution, though migration’s urgency lacks live-clock tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of dissolving lattice reweights "transiently rooted existence" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing—not stating—how honoring overlooked deaths charges stillness with meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "air tasted of dew and distant thunder"; rhythm mirrors interrupted cadence via sentence fragments. Zero POV drift despite lyrical compression—voice modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Her chest tight with emotion" risks label-only feeling; minor redundancy in "world above the clouds was quiet." Otherwise pristine propulsion—no loops, metaphors serve pressure ("wings slicing like a hymn").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms nature-writing tropes via specific ritual (spider-silk lattice as ephemeral monument). Bold risk in quiet closure—dissolving structure as victory—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
