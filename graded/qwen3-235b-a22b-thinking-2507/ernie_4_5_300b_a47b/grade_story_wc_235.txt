<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (alive/dead, jealousy/clarity) drive choices; "green-eyed monster" cliché slightly undermines embodied emotion in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("building the past"); minor ambiguity in lens shift from accumulative to causal at climax slightly obscures cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mountain environment constrains every choice (snow's false grounding, ledge's fissure); final blank scroll image charges closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (grave→scroll→climb); "jealousy coiled" crystallizes cost, but internal conflict escalation lacks one tangible trade-off beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "feral nostalgia" reweighted from curse to compass; final image avoids moralizing while reconfiguring premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mossy marker," "snow crunched"); minor register drift in "primal place" disrupts voice consistency under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; "jealousy coiled... green-eyed monster" redundancy in high-pressure moment deducts 0.3 per artifact screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes "finding grave" trope with chronicler's meta-struggle; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
