<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details ("glassworker’s fingers scraping stone") and embodied emotion ("hollow, creativity frayed"), but the "steadily adaptive" trait remains told until climax, slightly undermining early motivation. Survival backstory reflection exceeds BRR’s 20% limit without sufficient micro-choices to alter present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the shard’s "In the pauses, the truth breathes" crystallizes her stance with visible cost (abandoning vases for frost-etched panels). Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but the canyon walk transition lacks one beat of physical consequence to deepen the earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Canyon setting actively constrains choices (crevice forces crawling, frost guides navigation) and charges the final image—the shard’s warmth against her thigh reweights the environment’s meaning. Micro-setting (frost patterns) directly alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lirael’s agency (reading frost, entering crevice), but the survival backstory’s physical/emotional cost remains abstract; no present-tense demonstration of "hollow creativity" (e.g., a failed glass attempt) weakens the felt price paid for her new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "pauses" evolve from survival necessity to artistic philosophy via concrete actions (frost reading, shard handling). Avoids moralizing—final line "You just had to know where to look" earns resonance through prior particulars, though "mark time" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("bowl of indigo," "moss-slick rocks") with rhythmic control under pressure, but "drifting resonance" slightly overreaches Lirael’s plausible lexicon during high stress, creating minor register drift in a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (e.g., "breath fogging the air" conveys physiology, setting, emotion). Minor deduction for triple "or" in "numbers or maps or something older," slightly blunting momentum in a key discovery beat without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "survivor’s quest" through glass/frost motif system—Elias as "cartographer of hidden things" feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk distinction for making "pauses" the active protagonist, but ledger’s fire origin edges toward convenience, preventing 9.5.</comment>
