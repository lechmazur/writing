<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's hesitation to disrupt the hush versus compelled interjection; "lilac unease" embodies conflict without labels. Flaw: no genuine struggle beyond professional identity limits the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly when the hologram reveals the patterns as language, with "silence began to breathe" showing undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern-density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics function as micro-setting: tile alignment alters tactics and charges the final hologram image. Sensory narrowness (over-reliance on lilac/visuals) prevents 9.0 despite vivid, selective detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Mara's agency—pressing the tile shudders the grotto, narrowing options from observation to interjection. Cost is legible in the breathing silence, though visceral personal risk remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via the sand mandala's reconfiguration into language; "making space for new truths" avoids moralizing while charging the final white-chalk act with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in artist-specific noticing ("cerulean blue," "galaxy’s arm"), but "emergent hush" diction slightly clashes with Mara's lexicon during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "grains swirling like tiny dancers" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor risk: "lilac-hued glow" / "lilac unease" borders on repetition but charges tone purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: chalk art as decryption tool for acoustic phenomena transforms "whispering grotto" tropes. Emotional specificity in "unlearning" avoids abstraction, though mist setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
