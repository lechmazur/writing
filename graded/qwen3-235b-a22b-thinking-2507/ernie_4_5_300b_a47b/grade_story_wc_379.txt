<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses (curator’s logic vs emotional investment) drive choices; neighbors apply pressure through lore. Only flaw: secondary characters lack distinct micro-choices beyond functional exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly—"If you’re reading this" letter reweights love’s endurance with visceral cost. Causality holds throughout: locket → stories → number deduction → mailbox opening without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard cobblestones hide the locket; mailbox’s physicality (combination lock, tarnished state) constrains action and charges the final image. Micro-setting essential: "frayed chain" and "yellowed letters" embody history’s fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Mr. Hale identifies the lock type—Clara’s agency in dialing the numbers forecloses brute-force options. Cost is legible in her tears over the unfinished letter’s emotional and conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the locket’s "leads through following" inscription and the final line’s "solved by listening," avoiding moralizing. The unresolved letter reweights love’s endurance against war’s brutality without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrant mosaic of green and gold," "damp earth and old paper") filters setting through Clara’s curator lens. Rhythmic control intensifies at climax: short sentences for the mailbox opening heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed chain" and "yellowed letters" carry layered meaning. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction: "solved the mystery, not by force, but by listening" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms thrift-store trope via specific historical weight (1943 letters) and emotional authenticity—the soldier’s unfinished "If you’re reading this" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in quiet closure deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
