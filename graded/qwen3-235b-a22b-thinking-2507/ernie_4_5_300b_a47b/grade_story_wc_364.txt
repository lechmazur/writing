<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (meekness vs resolve) manifest physically during shard assault; blood cost makes endurance earned. Avoids diagnostic label-speak entirely—resilience shown through "didn’t flinch" not stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: bloodied arms and fused orb crystallize Jorin’s refusal of passivity. Minor causality hiccup—Lira’s sudden appearance lacks setup—but orb fusion compensates with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magician’s silk functions as micro-setting: absorbs shard strikes (constraining choice) and charges finale with "fierce blue" glow. Floating arches evolve from "skeletal hand" to steady symbols, mirroring Veyra’s rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: tunnel choices narrow options, shard assault forces endurance. Blood cost is unmistakable, but Lira’s warning lacks prior pressure escalation—Old Mara’s dissent feels isolated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "coax resilience from rubble" literalized as silk absorbing shards. Final bloom reweights opening decay without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite "resilience" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: blacksmith’s focus on tools ("calloused hands," "lantern flickered") persists under stress. Rhythmic compression during shard assault ("slicing his arms, drawing blood") heightens pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("damp earth and forgotten dreams" → "He didn’t flinch"). One near-miss: "azure glow" risks purple prose but earns payoff via silk’s evolving role in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "hero’s journey" via quiet defiance—no grand victory, just bloodied endurance. "Bartered awakening" reframes sacrifice as exchange, avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in Earned Stasis closure heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
