<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "triumph and terror" as stone flares; micro-choices (frayed string analysis, mercury coil) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of passive defiance for active creation earns cost via stone's "deeper hunger" visible on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: path revealed to lighthouse with "bleak exhilaration" crystallizing irreversible change. Causal lens holds—mercury coil directly triggers stone's hunger feedback loop with conceptual cost (world altered) legible in final clock image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hunger stone functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (frayed string analysis), charges closure via path revelation. Sensory specificity ("damp sand," "mercury shimmered") filtered through clockmaker's precision avoids white-room syndrome while tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elias' agency: failed first spin forces mercury innovation, narrowing options to single decisive choice. Cost ("stone felt colder... hunger deeper") visibly alters tactics and charges final image without soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "reverse-engineering wasn't enough" reframed as "initiate new mechanism." Final clocks ticking backward offer non-literal answer to "stepping beyond fate" without moralizing, reweighting premise via conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: "cogs shifted," "frayed at odd angle" reflects clockmaker's gaze. Rhythm accelerates during activation ("coil hummed... flared... erupted") then breathes at closure, avoiding uniform stress patterns under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "latency radiance trapped beneath its surface" compresses backstory into active image. Final line "clocks hung... ticking backward" delivers closure with crystalline specificity—no figurative muddle despite high density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Yoyo mechanics transform time-defiance trope: mercury coil innovation feels inevitable yet fresh. "Bleak exhilaration" crystallizes emotional truth beyond surface novelty, with lighthouse reactivation proving conceptual integrity through character-specific logic.</comment>
