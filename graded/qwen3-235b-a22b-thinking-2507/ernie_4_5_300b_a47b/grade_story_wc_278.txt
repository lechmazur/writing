<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (escaping past vs confronting guilt), but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation; the "breath hitched" moment shows embodied emotion yet the final act feels resolved too neatly without deeper struggle against her avoidance tendency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis (forgiveness replacing guilt), cost legible in the amber's faded glow and silent lab; however, the firmware's threat escalates via exposition ("dissonance will consume us all") rather than causal pressure narrowing Lira's options until the nursery scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (glow fading = dissonance resolved) and constrains choice (tethering method); lab's "ozone and regret" atmosphere evolves causally as machines groan during code rewrite, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silenced dissonance) tightens meaningfully when Lira reads the letter, softening cries into hum; but the "dissonance will consume us all" stakes remain abstract until the nursery, lacking visible price paid during escalation (e.g., no physical toll during firmware entry).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the letters' transformation from relics to healing tools; however, "guilt dissolving into understanding" risks thematic echo by stating the concept rather than letting the amber's fade alone resonate as the non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("walls hummed with forgotten frequencies," "flesh as canvas"), with rhythm accelerating during firmware entry; no head-hopping, and compression ("lab dissolved into static") is taught early and paid off in the digital labyrinth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "fractal patterns on the walls" shows textural specificity without muddle; minor register drift in "rewrote itself, guilt dissolving" slightly elevates diction beyond Lira's stressed POV during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo artistry with firmware repair avoids tropes; risk-taking in merging digital and antique elements heightens stakes, though the "scientists encoding guilt" premise leans slightly on familiar tech-guilt narratives without full transformation.</comment>
