<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "resiliently positive" trait is labeled repeatedly but lacks embodied tradeoffs (e.g., his brief wavering isn't tested by tangible stakes). Micro-choices like tuning the radio reveal values, but the final merger lacks struggle beyond a single line of hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: timelines merge with visible cost (ferry dissolving, Kael alone), but the final smile slightly obscures emotional cost. Lens holds through density accumulation (static→voices, fungi→spirals), though causality in the merger feels abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent veins constrain Kael’s radio tuning and directly charge the final constellation image. Sensory details (hollow echo, liquid starlight) are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally with the merger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merging timelines to free passengers) tightens via Kael’s radio broadcast, narrowing options to a binary choice. Cost is legible (ferry’s dissolution), but moral calculus lacks depth—the "unravel reality" risk is acknowledged yet resolved too cleanly without tangible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the hourglass reweights from empty vessel to eternal symbol, answering "completion vs. salvation" without moralizing. Final constellation image resonates non-literally, though "permanent transient" phrasing borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "hollow echo," "static that formed constellations") reflects Kael’s profession and stress. Repetition of "resiliently positive" slightly flattens voice, but compression during climax ("lurch—not forward, but sideways") teaches and pays off its pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in trait repetition ("resiliently positive" x3) and slight metaphor muddle ("vessel were both present and erased") prevent 8.5+. Otherwise, high density with strong verbs ("shuddered," "pulsed") and rhythmic control; closure image ("constellation: the Hourglass") is crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry myth and quantum motifs avoids cliché through specific grotto physics and commuter vignettes. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though the "bridge between worlds" trope isn’t fully transformed beyond its poetic setup.</comment>
