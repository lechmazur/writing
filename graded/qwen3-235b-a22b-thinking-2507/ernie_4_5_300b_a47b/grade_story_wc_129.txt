<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("luminescent ache"), but Lira's test motivation lacks sufficient causal groundwork in her introduction, slightly undermining the revelation's earned impact despite strong micro-choices during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly with Earned Stasis closure; the shared "luminescent ache" crystallizes cost through tangible reconfiguration ("thread connecting two hearts"), though the persistent constraint (light refraction mechanics) isn't leveraged enough in tactics to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices (light angles guiding search) and charges the final image (arbor constellations "winking"), but the crater's rim lacks tangible pressure on Kael's movements beyond serving as mural locations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (loneliness vs connection) escalate causally through Kael's agency, but Lira's convenient appearance as Veyra edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality, slightly blurring the cost's inevitability despite the potent shared ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the obsidian arbor's evolving symbolism, with the final image offering a resonant non-literal answer ("shared ache as thread"), though the "webs of kinship" concept risks slight abstraction without more concrete tactical integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in light-refraction details, but "luminescent ache" borders on clinical phrasing during peak stress, momentarily disrupting the lyrical voice's emotional immediacy in the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, though adjacent lines about shifting light ("colors that shifted with angle of light"/"follow the angles") create a mild paraphrase loop that dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinship-as-refraction transforms the search trope, with emotional specificity avoiding cliché; risk-taking in lyrical worldbuilding heightens stakes coherently, though the crater setting echoes familiar magical realism without full reinvention.</comment>
