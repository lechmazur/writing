<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks concrete contradictions; "thousand lifetimes" weight remains abstract without embodied micro-choices under pressure. Final renunciation earned but internal conflict stays conceptual ("doubt vs certainty") rather than manifesting in flawed behavior during pivotal mural sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: blank dictionary pages crystallize truth-as-process. Accumulative pressure builds through sensory density (shifting shelves, living mural) without causality breaks. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held flawlessly with one deepening (mural vision) narrowing options to internal confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Temple library vivid but functions as symbolic backdrop rather than active constraint; shelves shift reactively to words without pressuring decisions. Dictionary-as-tool charges closure (blank pages waiting for definitions), meeting 9+ gate, yet environmental details don't alter tactics during soul-confrontation sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling illusions) tightens through Witness's agency: mural's "see yourself" forces internal confrontation, with cost visible in "profound peace" after soul-vision. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory density, but cosmic/internal conflict interweaving needs sharper tangible manifestation beyond conceptual "battles between doubt and certainty".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dictionary's evolution and blank final pages—truth as continuous process, not destination. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though "cosmic illusions" concept slightly abstracts the visceral cost of embracing inner chaos shown in star-vision sequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of aged paper," flickering candlelight) with rhythmic control in mural sequence. Minor register drift: "spiral arbitration" academic phrasing distances during high-pressure soul-confrontation. "Resounding hush" repetition borders on mannered but pays off in closure's hush-as-reminder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "resounding hush" loops 4× with insufficient variation. Final paragraph's "brief, beautiful shift" slightly sentimental; star-vision metaphor ("thoughts drifted like clouds") risks mixed imagery. No fatal artifacts, yet minor overwriting dulls closure's conceptual punch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-mind metaphor with evolving dictionary mechanic. Avoids abstraction through tactile details (leather-bound tomes, candlelight), but "cosmic witness" archetype echoes familiar tropes. Bold risk in quiet closure, though universe-scale slightly overwhelms human-scale emotional truth of embracing chaos.</comment>
