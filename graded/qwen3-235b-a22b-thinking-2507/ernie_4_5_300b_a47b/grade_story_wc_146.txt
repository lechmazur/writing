<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks interior contradiction; "infinitely patient" stated without showing struggle during pivotal moments like the bell's harsh cry. No contradictory impulses act in scene despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (Kael stepping away amid revival), but cost of "years of waiting" remains implied rather than visibly dramatized during the townsfolk's instantaneous shift. Lens holds as Accumulative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tuning fork constrains choices (angle adjustments drive footsteps) and charges the final image ("stepped into the wild hush"). Cobblestones' physical alignment directly enables the climax's revival mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulating footsteps, but cost lacks on-page visibility during the critical townsfolk transformation. Their instant shift from "gaunt, wary" to joining the rhythm feels unearned by Kael's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (cobblestones aligning, bells harmonizing), but "shared balance" lacks friction—townsfolk's change occurs without dramatized resistance, weakening the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("ivory clawed," "thrum like earth’s core"), but voice remains uniformly lyrical during climax without stress-induced compression, e.g., when the bell’s "harsh with disuse" cry demands diction shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("crumbling wall"/"crumbling archway") and "wild hush" repetition (3x) reduce density. Final paragraph’s "bridge between past and future" slightly overwrites without advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rhythm-as-repair transforms ghost town tropes, but premise ("revival through patience") edges toward familiar templates without sufficient risk-taking in the townsfolk’s instantaneous acceptance.</comment>
