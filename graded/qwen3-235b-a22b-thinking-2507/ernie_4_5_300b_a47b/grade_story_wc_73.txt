<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in rupture moment ("obsession vs surrender"), but "balancedly daring" is diagnostic tell rather than embodied choice; flaw nearly costs 0.4 per policy though closure salvages it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "texture wasn't to possess—it was the space between" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric escalation to rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dice function as micro-setting charging closure (orbiting flaw = star), but staircase itself remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining tactics beyond spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single stake ("capture texture of loss") tightens through Kael's agency: mathematical proofs → die roll → rupture, with cost ("let them be") unmistakable in the orbiting dice's unreachable dance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (dice orbits as "space between"), avoiding moralizing; "grim but satisfied" edges toward tell but final image reweights loss as rhythm, not possession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("tasted of ozone and regret"), but "balancedly daring" violates POV lexicon with academic drift; rhythmic control under pressure otherwise exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "balancedly daring" is thesaurus-churn artifact in high-pressure beat; disallows 9+ globally though closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief physics ("wound that heals by bleeding forever"); risk-taking (mathematical obsession as emotional calculus) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
