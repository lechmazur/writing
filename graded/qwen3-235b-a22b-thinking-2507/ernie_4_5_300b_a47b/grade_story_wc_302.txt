<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (restless eyes vs. veiled face), but "cautious exuberance" is label-only emotion without embodied cost. Stolen watch backstory lacks present-tense moral friction during discovery. Micro-choices absent in high-pressure moments; actions follow clues mechanically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands with weak cost legibility—"heart racing" is generic, no tangible price paid for discovery. Orientation strong, but cipher resolution feels unearned: watch solves problem it didn’t create. Lens (Accumulative) holds, yet escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glowing library constrains choice via propagation delays as cipher medium, charging final image. Mist and shifting books create tactile pressure (e.g., "dampening fabric but not resolve"). Micro-setting triumph: light’s ripple pattern directly enables the blank-book revelation, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract until climax; "second letter approaching" creates urgency but no concrete tightening. Cyclic reversal trait isn’t leveraged for tradeoffs—Lira decodes it effortlessly. Cost feels emotional (racing heart) rather than visible or conceptual, failing Q4’s escalation band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unspoken words" theme emerges through blank-book revelation without moralizing. Final image reweights quest into tangible discovery, but lacks complexity—no counter-reading on whether some truths *should* stay hidden. Avoids thematic echo, yet emotional aftereffect feels thin due to unresolved watch backstory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist curled like ghostly serpents," light "rippled through air in waves") filters all description. Rhythmic control falters under pressure: no syntactic compression when she "moved faster," missing stress-induced diction shift. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively until climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is therapy-speak label (−0.3 artifact). Filter-verb stack near closure ("Lira smiled beneath her shawl, her heart racing") dulls immediacy. Otherwise clean propulsion, but "faint, ghostly script" slightly overwrites the pivotal discovery beat. No closure-dulling loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cipher via light propagation delays is fresh synthesis, avoiding trope recycling. "Unspoken words" frame feels inevitable in hindsight. Derivative quest structure ("find hidden library") capped score; watch backstory lacks transformative risk. Specificity (amber light pulses, cyclic delays) anchors universals without abstraction.</comment>
