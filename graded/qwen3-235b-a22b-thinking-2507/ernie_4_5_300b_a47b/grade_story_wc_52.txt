<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to resurrect him, but to harvest lessons," with embodied grief in sawdust/honey-scented hands. Final choice earned through carving micro-choices, though "hauntingly practical" trait lacks active constraint in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "carry the dead forward without being buried" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the fractured-light lion image, though persistent constraint (timelessness) isn't named until end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Loft functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (timeless bubble enabling reflection), while ash wood directly charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("damp wool," "rust-hued peace") filters through Clara's grief without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through carving agency—"here and gone" concept transforms tactics as wood yields. Cost is unmistakable in "carry the dead forward," though escalation relies solely on textural accumulation without visible tradeoff beyond emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: carving as transformation reweights "here and gone" without moralizing. Final line "carving the void into something that could hold the light" offers resonant non-literal answer to grief's meaning, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watercolor haze," "discarded seconds") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression taught early via kettle transitions; no head-hopping as psychic distance tightens during carving.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver threads that blurred the city’s skyline" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Rhythm accelerates during carving ("resisted... yielded... split") without figurative muddle, culminating in flawless final image propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief through tangible creation avoids tropes via ash wood specificity. Risk-taking in quiet Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "rust-hued peace" slightly echoes common decay-beauty motifs without full transformation.</comment>
