<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "melancholy of this moment" amid clinical duty, but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality during high-stakes countdown; "didn't care" about drones slightly undermines prior tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "tiny, purposeful figure against the void" crystallizes human obsolescence with conceptual cost, while Accumulative lens holds through relentless chronometer beats tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crater functions as micro-setting—undisturbed dust constrains vial placement, summit chill seeps through suit—charging the final image where Earth’s glow mirrors fading gas; sensory economy perfectly calibrated to urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (human care vs. drone indifference) tightens through dawn countdown, but drone pressure lacks escalation beyond chime; cost is felt in "summit felt colder," though "didn’t care" slightly dilutes stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through archival shadow discovery: "some truths don’t need an audience" avoids moralizing, while archivist’s realization reweights "outlasted indifference" as conceptual repricing without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lunar lexicon ("Lunar Standard Time," "crater-inspection visor") and rhythmic compression during countdown ("04:57... 17 minutes left") modulate voice under pressure; zero filter verbs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "golden gas that danced" exemplifies high-density lyricism without muddle. Final "dawnlit melancholy" phrase borders abstraction but saved by concrete archival payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms space-age tropes via chemical time-capsule specificity; archivist discovering the shadow feels earned, non-obvious synthesis where human fragility outlasts technology through mundane documentation.</comment>
