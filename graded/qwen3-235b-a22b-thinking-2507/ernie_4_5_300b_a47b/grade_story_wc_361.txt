<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Kail's jittery fear battles duty in micro-choices (e.g., kneeling despite distrust). Epiphany earned through tactile sapling contact, not labels. Woman's thin characterization slightly limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Veyra’s absence wasn’t an ending—it was a germination" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (weight "lighter" in hand). Causal lens holds from Veyra's departure to sapling growth. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Aurora actively warps lantern light and later "coils like tendrils" during germination. Frost-cracked ridgeway stone becomes literal planting ground—environment constrains choice and charges final image with iridescent leaves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when pendant vibrates toward the stranger, forcing Kail’s "Why me?" moral calculus. Cost manifests as identity shift from courier to "soil," visible in the sapling’s warmth against his palm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sapling’s growth: "absence as germination" reweights Veyra’s lessons without moralizing. Final image ("weight... lighter") delivers non-literal answer to "seeds" question through concrete transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: aurora "painting stone path" through Kail’s anxious eyes. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Kail froze. She knew his schedule?"). No head-hopping; Veyra’s laughter filtered through pendant vibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops. "Roots erupted, thin and silver, weaving through the cracks" does triple duty (action, setting, metaphor). Final line’s crystalline simplicity avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms mentor-protégé trope via tactile mechanics (vibrations, seed planting). "Soil" metaphor feels inevitable yet non-obvious, with emotional truth avoiding sentimentality through physical sapling manifestation.</comment>
