<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority excels through concrete, character-particular embodiment ("spine tighten," "velvet disquiet") and contradictory impulses (dread vs. purpose in the shriek's reinterpretation). Final choice to listen rather than stop the storm is causally earned through lifelong archival practice, but micro-choices during memory immersion lack sufficient contradictory tension under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "he would be ready—not to stop the storm, but to listen" crystallizes stance with visible resolve ("wrinkles deepening"). Orientation is flawless by line 5, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through sensory density escalation to the harmonic hum discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Garden actively constrains choices (roses blooming only with human breath) and charges the final image ("garden seemed to hold its breath"). Wax cylinder’s physicality—rough edges against fingers, cradled palm—directly shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for micro-setting charging the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as Voss decodes the harmonic hum, narrowing options from confusion to purposeful waiting. Cost is unmistakable in "wrinkles deepening with resolve" and the shift from passive dread to active archival commitment, though the single pressure point slightly limits escalation depth for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "roots remember/leaves scream" motif; final line reweights the prophecy without moralizing. The resonant, non-literal answer ("The roots remembered, and so would he") perfectly satisfies the 9+ quick test by charging prior material through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "bruise-purple twilight" and "velvet disquiet," with rhythm modulating under pressure (staccato during the shriek, lyrical in memory immersion). Old High Martian phrases feel authentically rooted in Voss’s expertise, avoiding register drift even at peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "foghorn had fallen silent hours ago" exemplifies propulsion through concrete specificity. Final line’s parallel structure ("The roots remembered...") delivers closure resonance without figurative muddle, satisfying the 9+ quick test with crystalline density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional archaeology via wax cylinder medium transforms archivist tropes. Risk-taking in redefining prophecy as awakening (not disaster) heightens stakes coherently, with specificity ("roses blooming only in human breath") anchoring universals beyond derivative safety.</comment>
