<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details ("phantom scent," "chest light") with authentic contradiction between professional detachment and emotional resonance. Micro-choices like comparing screw curves to mainspring reveal values without therapy-speak. Slight over-reliance on backstory for motivation prevents 9.0 despite flawless flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: returning the screw crystallizes Mrs. Voss's redemption with visceral cost in Lira's "chest light" and the fog lifting. Orientation anchors at 45 words, Accumulative lens holds through density escalation. Near-miss 9.0 due to thematic echo risk in "ordinary miracle" phrasing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water clock mechanics and birthing screw function as micro-setting that constrains choices (comparing tension-release curves) and charges the final image. Fog evolves from atmospheric to symbolic pressure. Only deduction: river description lacks specific constraint beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unresolved guilt) tightens through Lira's discovery process, but agency remains observational rather than active choice. Cost is felt ("chest light") yet insufficiently visible for 8.8+ band. Escalation valid under Accumulative lens via density increase in engraving revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (screw engraving → Eleanor photo) without moralizing. Final river reflection reweights "ordinary miracles" as resilience, avoiding sentimentality. Earned wisdom through Lira's tactile investigation satisfies 9+ quick test with two elevating features.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phantom scent," gear rhythms) modulates perfectly from foggy opacity to clarity. Voice avoids POV leakage despite backstory. Minor register drift in "humanize the inanimate" prevents 9.0; otherwise exemplary rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion, but "humanize the inanimate" is abstract telling in high-pressure beat. Final line risks sentimentality ("learning to weave") yet saved by concrete antecedents. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory loss with time mechanics avoids disability tropes. Specificity anchors universals (algae-clogged gears, worn threads). "Ordinary miracle" concept slightly familiar, but transformed through water clock metaphor and Eleanor’s tangible redemption arc.</comment>
