<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "wistfully pragmatic" is labeled but not tested in action. Mara's shift lacks embodied cost despite strong setup ("fingers brushing his"). Diagnostic line about watering stems triggers -0.4 penalty for label-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise (Mara closing eyes to light) with conceptual cost of prolonged grief. Orientation clear by paragraph 1. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but cost proof is diffuse—"for the first time in years" lacks pinpointed physical consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: bitting gauge tooth constrains choices (tapping rhythm) and charges final image (window sill tapping). Harbor moonlight actively pressures action when Elias opens the shutter. Meets 9+ gate via tool-as-setting with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (dock tapping → bait shop visit) under Accumulative lens. But dominant stake ("dark corners") remains abstract; Mara's cost isn't viscerally shown through concrete loss (e.g., shuttered shop consequences). One tightening suffices but lacks felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through particulars (petal drop → rosebush waiting), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "light" as shared rhythm without stating morals. Lacks the "competing goods" complexity for 9+; Elias's motivation faces no internal friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tool notches as "tiny stars," salt/diesel smells) shines. But voice doesn't degrade under stress—Elias's poetic "luminous harbor" observations continue uninterrupted when emotionally vulnerable at Mara's door.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("metal groaning beneath his boots"). Minor artifact: "quivering hush" appears 3x with near-identical phrasing (synonym churn), and final "protected vulnerability like mist" uses dead metaphor. Not closure-touching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "light in darkness" trope via lockmaster's tool as hope symbol. Fire escape gardening feels fresh through occupational specificity. But widow's grief arc follows predictable beats—no unexpected turn like initial refusal of the gauge.</comment>
