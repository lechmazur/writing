<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("serene anger," "old fire quenched to ember") and embodied motivation ("question lodged under my ribs") drive choices; refusal of throne earns renunciation with visible cost ("let the ink on my skin disappear"). Slight abstraction in "consciously wild" lacks concrete manifestation mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "for a breath, the hummingbird loses me" crystallizes the stakes. Accumulative lens holds—ink patterns tighten pressure toward crystallization. Minor momentum drag in mentor backstory exceeds BRR limits but doesn't fracture causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Disappearing ink constrains every choice (must read patterns before fade) and charges the final image ("step through to the heart"). Wind-carved dunes function as micro-setting—gravity guides ink "confession," altering tactics. No ornamental detail; salt-blue hut and auric ribs serve closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: ink patterns deepen knowledge ("buyer is hunger"), narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is visceral—the disappearing body outline and hummingbird's momentary loss. Single tightening suffices; algorithm reveal transforms "why time slows" from question to lived cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink mechanics, not statement: "crisis should be no one's currency" is motivation, not moral. Final image ("metronome forgets how to count") reweights time-as-commodity with conceptual cost. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "hollow I left in the air."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sand that half-remembers," "wings sing in arid Morse"); rhythm compresses under pressure ("I spill... lie down... become levee"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from "serene anger" to crystalline refusal. Slight register drift in "consciously wild" avoids penalty through context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pale as salt" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language never muddles action ("ephemeral architecture rises in the film"). Final line crystallizes concept without ornament. One borderline abstract phrase ("consciously wild") redeemed by tactical embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: disappearing ink as crisis-exploitation mechanism, not trope. Emotional truth in "algorithm that wants every heart to lag" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (metronome as fear-chamber) heightens stakes coherently; transformation test passed—swap ink for blood, and logic collapses.</comment>
