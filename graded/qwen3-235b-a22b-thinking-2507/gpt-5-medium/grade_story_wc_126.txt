<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction through acoustic perception vs. ecological grief, but lacks sufficient simultaneous conflicting impulses during peak moments; Lark's dialogue reveals micro-choices yet final renunciation lacks visceral cost escalation beyond conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost in "the bowl grows heavy with gentle obligations," fulfilling accumulative lens through patterned deepening; orientation anchors within 40 words and cost proof evident in the greenhouse footprints as enduring song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shipwreck-ringed greenhouse actively constrains choices (playing indoors, lantern circle) and charges closure through footprints on steps; brackish light and rusted flanks function as micro-setting that reconfigures the orchard's purpose without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through violinist's agency in explaining unfinished songs to Lark, narrowing options toward tending "halves and almosts"; conceptual cost of "gentle obligations" unmistakably alters tactics as they follow footprints into evening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "magnificent simplicity" reweights the bowl's contents without moralizing; final footprints image resonates as "song that refuses to be done," avoiding thematic echo while answering the central question through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in acoustic framing ("barnacles hold their breath"); rhythmic control sustains lyric compression through shipwreck creaks as "old chairs," with pattern taught early and closure paid in the tide's pull.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots drinking brackish light" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose, though slight synonym proximity in bowl contents ("marble... seed... coin") nudges below 9.5 despite perfect final line propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and artistic endurance through "unfinished" motif; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes via barnacles' breath and warped coins as survival artifacts.</comment>
