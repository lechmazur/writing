<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("mangled both" intention/action) drives closure; embodied grief via metal refusing polish and "fingers in the hinge" metaphor avoids abstraction. Slight deduction as "learning a second anatomy" borders on thematic echo but redeemed by soldering wire ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "lily still glowed faintly where fingerprints warmed the glass" crystallizes cost of endurance. Accumulative lens holds from Devin's loom metaphor through mother's scene; orientation nailed in opening 20 words with "stopped calendar" and "cracked telescope cradle".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Observatory mechanism actively constrains choices: projector transforms vellum into aurora, brass dawn enables the lily's payoff. "Fingertips warmed the glass" charges final image with tactile specificity—environment as essential tool, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single stake (transforming grief) tightens via mother's scene where "curtains flickered when she named a future that could not happen." Cost crystallizes in "good grief is a hinge... you never slam it because your fingers are in there"—visible tradeoff shaping closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through origami coordinates and soldered wire rings, not moralizing. Final "lily that sings" reweights rock-bottom opening with conceptual cost: "the night does not forgive haste, but it learns... to lean toward the smallest, truest heat."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: jeweler's tactile POV ("beads cut from coal," "cool as pocket water") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Ardor subdued as a red star" modulates tone without filter verbs; no head-hopping in lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances texture ("light found dust like a river finds silt"). Figurative language stays consistent (loom/weave motif), climaxing in closure's "fingertips warmed the glass"—no muddle, pure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: astronomy reframed as grief pedagogy via projector mechanics. "Tutor of endings" transforms mourning trope through specific stakes (origami coordinates), avoiding abstraction. Risk heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
