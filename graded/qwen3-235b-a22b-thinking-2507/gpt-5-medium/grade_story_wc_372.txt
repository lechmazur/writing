<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract in peak moments ("I would catalog the erased months"); embodied emotion strong but occasional thematic gloss dilutes contradiction. Final vow earned through prior micro-choices like steadying mittened hands amid fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "I became another entry, but also the keeper" crystallizes the library's survival price. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—pressure tightens through sensory density (shelves creaking, snowbirds weaving) without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen library isn't backdrop but active constraint: icicles spell alphabets, mittens enable ledger work, snowbirds reshape constellations. Final image of "constellations rearranged to a steadier grammar" charges closure through micro-setting evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: measuring fractured pledges escalates to the impossible directive. Cost is visceral in "vows harvested me"—becoming part of the archive forecloses solitude with tangible sacrifice under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "measure even absences" reframes preservation as active defiance. Final image avoids moralizing—rearranged constellations offer non-literal answer to oblivion without stated moral, charged by snowbirds' key-like flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: light frequencies as "patterned sorrow," breath frosting lens rims. Rhythm compresses under stress ("The glass screamed with his name") while maintaining distinct voice. Zero head-hopping; refraction stays POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "numbers that rang like bells left inside melting glaciers" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor deduction: "patterned sorrow" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat, but clarity remains intact near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes tropes through hyper-specific mechanics: luminous vows as measurable light, vows harvesting the keeper. Emotional truth in "file their shadows" elevates beyond novelty; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
