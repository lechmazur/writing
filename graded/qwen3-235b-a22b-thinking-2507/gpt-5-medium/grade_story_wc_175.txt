<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("transiently rooted but stubborn") and micro-choices (tying wing knot) reveal character, but "blushing stillness" abstraction edges toward stock phrasing; final promise to "stitch names from moss" earns Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: "grotto above clouds" lacks concrete who/where anchors by 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty; Accumulative lens holds through cadence density shifts, but vagueness caps score despite strong Charged Poise closure ("waited for history to answer").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (moth wing, resin bead) constrains choices and charges closure, but "grotto above clouds" breaks physical logic; moss/water details ground the final image, though macro-setting plausibility flaw prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulating gestures (pollen circles to heartbeat signals), but hawk shadow interruption lacks tangible cost escalation; "transiently rooted" insight reweights options under Accumulative lens, though pressure remains internalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "interrupted cadence" evolves from water taps to heartbeat, culminating in non-literal answer ("waited for history to answer gently"); avoids moralizing despite philosophical density, though "municipal forgetfulness" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("freckled parchment," "dullness turned oracle") with rhythmic control, but "composting under municipal forgetfulness" injects academic register jarringly; voice modulates effectively during hawk shadow interruption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "fern stems long short long short" achieves high density. Minor mixed metaphor ("burned syllable of orange") and "blushing stillness" borderline cliché prevent 8.5+, but final line's simplicity redeems clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "building temporary structures as signals" method, transforming eco-memoir tropes through undocumented larva-feeders; risks lyric density but maintains coherence, though "monarch as metaphor" lacks sufficient novelty for 8.5+.</comment>
