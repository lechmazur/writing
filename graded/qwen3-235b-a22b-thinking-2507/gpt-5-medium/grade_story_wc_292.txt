<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "nervously confident" librarian risking exile to honor ancestor; embodied dread ("spongey but no longer directionless") shows authentic progression. Minor deduction for "stubborn about honoring dead" feeling stated rather than fully earned until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Liza's "grainy with salt" return and braided mists reconfigure exile's meaning. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—humidity and coded stanzas tighten pressure toward the nail's insertion without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Weather station constrains every choice: dripping anemometers force nail solution, jet stream shift creates live clock, and humidity affects journals. Final image of "mists braiding both directions" charges closure through environmental reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Liza emerges—her salt-grained face makes exile's cost visceral. Protagonist's agency in overriding the system drives escalation, but director's opposition lacks depth ("dry prunes eyes" feels shorthand), slightly muting the cost's impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "librarianship, which is simply stewardship with better indexes" crystallizes honor without moralizing. Final braided mists reweight "reversible exile" as communal refuge, avoiding tidy resolution while charging the concept with social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("maps are questions you keep asking with ink") shines early, but relentless metaphors in climax ("squalls staggered like wounded cattle") cross into overwriting, dulling the pivotal nail insertion with lyrical clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion falters in high-pressure beats: "spongey dread" repetition creates paraphrase loop, and stacked modifiers ("rusted panel waited with a keyhole sized not for a key") obscure the machine activation. Final image remains clear but lacks line-level precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reversible exile" as braided refuge transforms weather tropes. Copper nail as conductor feels inevitable, though "dry prunes eyes" for director slightly echoes cliché. Bold atmospheric risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
