<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserving grief vs. creating connection) drive micro-choices under pressure, earning Earned Stasis closure when the bell steadies the grieving volunteer. "Powerfully gentle" hands embody the tension, though "texture of connection" risks slight abstraction early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the city tuning itself to hope" reconfigures connection’s meaning with undeniable cost (ongoing labor of listening). Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly—density peaks at the ferry bell’s rainbow threads reframing grief, with cost legible in "let the questions propel listening."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (polishing to bend sound) and charging the final image ("moonlight lingers on my palms"). Golden shadows evolve from passive description to active metaphor for law’s fragility and shared patience, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: questioning assumptions narrows options from abstract promise ("discover texture of connection") to tangible cost—volunteer’s grief reframed by the ferry bell. Cost is unmistakable in "the pilgrimage will travel tomorrow," where connection demands perpetual motion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("city tuning itself to hope") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question—connection as braid, not bridge—without moralizing. Theme emerges through particulars: ferry bell’s "rainbow threads" reweighting grief, avoiding nostalgia via "courage to let sound suggest repair."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices "mathematics of survival" in lens smell, "citrus from someone chewing fear." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences when volunteer whispers about his brother—while maintaining lyrical consistency. Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "golden shadows" recur with purposeful variation. High density: "boots, gulls, and a promise on a pier" compresses history into sensory threads. Minor deduction for "mathematics of survival" bordering on abstraction, but redeemed by "damp tunnels" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound/memory reframes grief as mutable texture. Risk-taking heightens stakes: "artificial pilgrimage" avoids spectacle via "menders, not tourists," transforming "power grid stabilizes" into visceral emotional tuning. Avoids safety-middle through specific stakes (drowned brother’s sandbar).</comment>
