<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wishing had cost") and embodied emotion ("regret my tools could not file smooth") drive credible renunciation; final choice to prioritize keeper over portal forecloses escape path with felt cost in abandoned timelines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure where "chose the keeper, the unbroken tide" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (lost portal); Accumulative lens holds via density escalation, though keeper's call slightly edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hunger stone and lighthouse function as micro-setting constraining choices (reverse-engineering under tidal pressure); "floodmark" placement and "unbroken tide" final image charge closure with environmental specificity that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping fate) tightens via protagonist's blood offering revealing timelines; cost unmistakable in "threads snuffing" and abandoned portal, though escalation relies slightly on external revelation rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "latent radiance" transforming from hunger to refusal; final image ("unbroken tide") resonantly answers "step beyond fate" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars like the keeper's scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stones sweated salt and secrets") and rhythmic control under pressure ("yoyo hung trembling"); elision of father/lovers taught early via concrete cues, modulating voice intensity without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("regret my tools could not file smooth" does triple duty); near-flawless propulsion, though "latent radiance climbed walls like fever seeking skin" risks borderline purple prose without sufficient prior pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker mysticism transforms tropes; "reverse-engineering yoyo" mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight, though risk-taking slightly obscures causality clarity during timeline vision sequence.</comment>
