<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied emotion ("jaw ache like old rope") and micro-choices under pressure (tasting air above blue sand). Contradictory impulses—preserving vs. transforming remorse—drive the keeper's pivotal memory reveal. Flaw: motivation to cook coral lacks sufficient internal friction beyond "let me cook you" instinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: keeper "staring at his hands as if they might break politely" then standing taller, remorse "subsumed into a body that could bear it." Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (puddles, ice prisms, broth) reweighting the stake. No orientation debt; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (puddles as "mirrors without frames") constrains choice by charting the path to the pavilion and charges the final image ("puddles began to vanish... leaving only salt rings"). Coral’s "frozen mid-bloom" specificity directly shapes tactics—cutting prisms for broth. Avoids white-room syndrome via tactile, lived-in details like "blistered peppers hissing like dunes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing remorse without erasure) tightens through one decisive deepening: tasting the keeper’s memory via coral filament. Cost is unmistakable—"gums with rust," "threatened to splinter everything"—and reshapes tactics (cooking broth). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; coincidence (flood revealing pavilion) complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sandpaper rough memories, not erase them" crystallized when broth "scoured my throat with brass, then softened." Final image (keeper eating quietly, salt rings vanishing) offers resonant answer—remorse integrated, not fixed—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lies in "sturdy brittle" endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chef’s sensory lexicon ("taste of stored remorse," "salt note that made my jaw ache") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in high-stakes moments ("I blistered peppers until they hissed") with taught elision (dream disorientation). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during coral contact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "puddles stitched the courtyard like mirrors without frames" advances setting and character POV. Minor scaffold in "the words rattled like dry crockery in my chest" slightly dulls immediacy. No loops; high density where "barley for patience and lime for admission" does triple duty. Final line’s "salt rings" recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: culinary magic transforms remorse into tangible broth, avoiding tropey "erase memories" clichés. Fresh inflection in coral’s "porous" ice archive—remorse made durable yet transformable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure; specificity ("coral icebound pavilion beneath dunes") anchors universals.</comment>
