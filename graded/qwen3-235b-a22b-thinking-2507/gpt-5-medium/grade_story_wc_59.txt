<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince's interior contradiction (conquest upbringing vs. repair mission) manifests in specific actions like unwrapping the egg "like forgiveness for a storm," but abstract phrases like "quaking reverie" slightly dilute embodied emotion during high-pressure hatching scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the hatched creature's song reconfigures the world with visible cost (gears ceasing complaint, engineers weeping), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic cradle assembly to lightning-triggered hatching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices—chains must "sing" for hatching, stalactite acoustics tune the cradle—and the rose window charges the final image when Dawnspoke's feather "perched on every helmet," meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: hypothesizing → scavenging → cradle assembly narrows options under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in "gears complained like old judges" and the prince's "sadness turned useful" endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "vines to climb iron like tutors" and rust growing "petals" offer non-literal resolution to "can beauty return?" without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in how the prince notices "dust from murals of ancestors who chased birds with nets made of chainmail," with rhythmic control deepening under pressure ("He fasted, listened, and spoke only in lullabies").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story with purposeful density ("feathered with light the color of old brass polished by tears" charges closure), and final line resolves through image-charged action without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "Dawnspoke" as "crossroads given breath"—neither lost species nor machine—transforms mechanical dystopia through specific, verifiable details like "fishers of cloud fog," avoiding trope reliance.</comment>
