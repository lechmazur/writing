<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in poet's "warmly attentive" micro-choices (kneeling to write in sand) but boy's grief lacks layered irrationality; embodied "wind inside him" avoids labels yet final shift feels slightly tidy for high-band 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "ribbonless yet tethered" crystallizes stance on incompleteness; Accumulative lens holds through density shifts but kite-snap coincidence slightly softens protagonist agency in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drake's feather functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (writing tool → kite ribbon) and charges final image; "cobalt lagoon" evolves from reflective surface to active pressure point with puddled sand enabling the sand-script.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incompleteness) tightens via kite snap's "loud asymmetry," but escalation relies partly on external event (wind snapping string) rather than pure protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost ("song richer in torn places") is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven dawns" as braided mistakes—final image ("kite becomes one more cloud with a handle") reframes loss without moralizing; "discord becomes a harbor" earns resonance through prior sand-scripting, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("reeds breathe in burnished hush") and rhythmic control under pressure ("wind answers with laughter sharper than he can bear") exemplify voice; slight register drift in "lacquered leaves" barely touches peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crimson diamond leaping beyond reach" demonstrates high density with propulsion; final line ("dawns to weave themselves") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle—flawless line craft in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven dawns" as braided mistakes transforms cliché; risk-taking in quiet closure (no kite retrieval) heightens stakes, but "wise mentor" trope slightly tempers ingenuity despite poet's specific feather ritual.</comment>
