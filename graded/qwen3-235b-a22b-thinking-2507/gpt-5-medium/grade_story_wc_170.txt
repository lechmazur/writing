<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("borrowed heartbeat" vs hospital pallor) drives choice; embodied emotion in "tremor in my ribs" avoids labels. Final renunciation of command ("never to command") earned by prior causality with visible cost in mirror work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "hospital pallor" replaced by citrus road/hands "I had yet to hold." Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density ("hanging strands of water") to reweighted stakes in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains choice (followed to find door) and charges final image ("reef remembering sunlight"). Terrace's wet stone breath anchors setting early while mirroring internal transformation—environment directly shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (mirrors showing defeat vs possibilities) tighten through protagonist's agency—singing lullabies alters mirror's behavior. Escalation via Accumulative lens: sensory density ("colors trembled like shy birds") reweights cost until bells "rang like a joining" with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror motif: "spill futures the way rain spills color" evolves into final image of "kitchen with sun on the floor." No moralizing—resonant answer in "hands I had yet to hold" reweights prior hospital defeat without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone breathed its wet scent") modulates under pressure—diction compresses during singing ("vowels carry like boats"). No head-hopping; experimental lyricism taught early ("prism parapet after rain") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("narrow as a thread of rain and different as heat") propels momentum. Figurative language in peak beats ("fog lifted from within, like a sleeper turning over") clarifies rather than obscures closure. No register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical fragility and artistic hope via "borrowed heartbeat" trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—mirage painter's "exhausted smile" transforms cliché. Specific citrus road image avoids generic optimism.</comment>
