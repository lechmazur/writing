<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyr’s diminutive stature fuels his quiet power; Serane’s embodied tremor and unraveling signature reveal internal conflict through physical detail rather than labels. Final renunciation earned by the ink pellet’s visceral action on her skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: Serane’s name blurring under ink reconfigures identity with undeniable social stakes. Orientation anchors by line 5; rune-driven escalation narrows options coherently under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet functions as micro-setting—constraining choices (writing messages, rolling onto Serane’s finger) and charging the final image. Dust motes and rune-etched columns mirror internal states through action, not overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via book sequence: each volume deepens Serane’s realization with escalating cost (heir meaning "heavier," lineage knots). But escalation relies on pre-planted books rather than her active choices under pressure, limiting agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truth arrived like tides" avoids abstraction; final glossary-sealed scrap offers resonant, non-literal answer to imposture. No moralizing, though "winter" in messages slightly over-signals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vellum leaves like pressed storms," "laughter bound into indexes") filters all detail. Prose modulates rhythm under pressure—short phrases during Serane’s undoing ("Columns did not fall; instead, the air arranged falling").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink recognized kinship before law did" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "retinue glittered like borrowed noon" risks diluting momentum, but final image ("slept like potential thunder") charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "unmasking pretender" trope through specific tools (ink pellet, rune) and emotional truth—Serane’s "childhood syllable surfaced like a drowning star." Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
