<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under stress; flawless competence during fog crisis undermines "genuine struggle" requirement despite strong embodied emotion in water-refraction method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through "settled wheels" image reconfiguring tension with visible cost ("depot exhales as though rails unclenched a fist"), but fog complication lacks sufficient prior vulnerability to deepen the earned calm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Water bowls function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges closure; "rain's drumhead" coordinates directly enable the drone's final success, making the tool indispensable to tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through fog thickening (textural density increase), but the artisan's seamless adaptation lacks the "visible price" required for 8.8+; raindrop solution feels earned yet minimizes the cost of near-failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "quiet geometry of routes" without moralizing; final image of drone landing "warm with work" offers resonant answer to navigation-as-trust, but lacks layered ambiguity about the cost of precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metal vowels," refraction-as-compass) sustains Accumulative lens; rhythmic control under pressure ("anchor chain keeps climbing, rattling the morning like beads") earns 9+ despite slight register drift in "quiet geometry."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts; high density with "timbers groaning like a great throat clearing" justified by POV, but "metal vowels" edges toward mixed metaphor without sufficient payoff in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness-as-asset through water physics transforms tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes via tactile navigation, though "maiden voyage" framing slightly dilutes originality despite strong execution.</comment>
