<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as "giving away coincidence" is intriguing but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; the prickle of embarrassment about prophecy-fulfillment shows character-particularity yet remains surface-level without deeper struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—"panic extracted from marrow" crystallizes in the ash curtain without panic—but early lens ambiguity (hybrid Accumulative/Situational) slightly weakens causal pressure until the evacuation sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand beach actively constrains choices (safe ridge path, wet-shine breadcrumbs) and the bottled fireflies charge the final image as "revised stars," fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure with volcanic specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating light-bottles and arrivals, but pressure relies too heavily on coincidence (sputtering engine, closed road) rather than Mara's agency; the conceptual cost of transformed fear lacks visceral felt weight in key beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through firefly motif reweighting—"revised stars practicing new steps" offers resonant non-literal answer to transformation without moralizing—avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty while deepening through evacuation practice as "sung softly" safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("glass chiming softly," "marrow of the village"), but slight register drift in "destitute philanthropist who gave away coincidence" momentarily distances voice from embodied immediacy during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; high density with "ash that curtained stars without panic" doing triple duty—image, tension, theme—while rhythmic control ("slow dance of celestial bodies") sustains propulsion without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms volcanic evacuation trope through firefly-evacuation mechanics; emotional specificity in "texture of transformation" avoids abstraction, though the "destitute philanthropist" angle lacks fresh inflection beyond the core motif.</comment>
