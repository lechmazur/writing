<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mistook spinning for direction" and "clumsy nocturne," but backstory block risks BRR limits; emotional progression avoids tidiness yet "sold a rumor once that broke her" edges toward summary without sufficient embodied immediacy in peak regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the "clumsy nocturne" crystallizes options with visceral cost ("peaches and iron filings, summer and storm"), while Accumulative/Textural lens holds through scent-mechanics escalation; one minor causality drift in metronome repair timing barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perfume bottle functions as micro-setting—constraining choices via circuitry and charging final image with scent-memory—but orchard pressure feels slightly external; "violet glass clouded by decades of patient sighs" achieves 9+ specificity yet falls just short of full environmental constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly via orchard deadline ("truck backed nearer") driving protagonist agency (calling foreman), but secondary pressure from gossip-column identity lacks full integration; cost is unmistakable in "clumsy" performance yet moral calculus between career survival and apology could deepen further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" reweights organically through broken metronome and column offer, avoiding moralizing; final image of shared nocturne delivers non-literal thematic answer where "imperfect miracle, it was ours" crystallizes earned ambiguity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterful ("dust sang under my shoes," "orchard kept its last lullaby"); rhythm modulates flawlessly from lyrical opening to staccato tension ("Forgive, and then stopped like a throat in smoke"), with zero POV leakage or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Letters assembled like shy fish" demonstrates high information density, but "violet glass clouded by decades of patient sighs" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; no loops or scaffold, though one borderline figurative string ("peaches and iron filings, summer and storm") skirts density limits.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes via "gossip-column exorcist" specificity and metronome circuitry; emotional truth in "stealing peaches between nocturnes" avoids abstraction, but "imperfect miracles" concept slightly echoes familiar refrains without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
