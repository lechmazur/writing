<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "luminous doubt" enabling action; micro-choices like testing dreams against pelicans' circles prove earned stakes. Final renunciation of sole guardianship lands with visible cost in soaked hair and monsoon's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when seed sprouts: monsoon becomes "punctuation, not erasure" with felt cost in physical exhaustion. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density (pollen, red rain) reweights memory's survival without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hibiscus pollen constrains the climax—its "thin red rain" triggers planting—while final "vowels that will not wash away" charges closure. Ridge blooms actively shift tactics, rejecting postcard description for pressure-driven specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative escalation: humidity-altered flower testimony and "bruise of rain" tighten pressure. Cost legible when monsoon's arrival shifts from threat to "commas sewing breath," though "it waited" slightly softens tension before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—releasing "boasting" while keeping "lullabies"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights memory as "vowels that will not wash away," answering the central question without abstraction or balanced toggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "petals debate like cautious jurors" filters reality through the checker's empirical whimsy. Iru's dialogue ("stories feared drowning or erasure?") contrasts with adult lexicon, while rhythm modulates from lyrical to urgent under monsoon pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "droplets spelling names on our hands" achieves high density without muddle. Only "metronome of recollection" risks abstraction but redeems via immediate tactile action (seed trembling), preserving propulsion through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "collective memory" trope through specific mechanics: tidebook testing against pelicans, releasing curses while keeping warnings. Emotional truth in "both [drowning and erasure]" avoids binary thinking, synthesizing ecological/cultural stakes with risk-taking coherence.</comment>
