<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shielded openness" vs. methodical curiosity; micro-choices like tracing the seam reveal hierarchy of values when verger crosses himself. Final framing of the tear as "wound/seam" earns closure with visible cost of surrendering control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (silent videos → whispered names) to Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in "let their whispers belong to the room" as villagers relinquish ownership, reconfiguring the hush from mystery to shared inheritance without resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault constrains every choice: damp dictates video analysis method, lime bubbles guide discovery, and the seam's cold air enables the climax. Final image of vault "breathing like a bellows" charges closure by transforming setting into living witness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: comparing silent videos narrows options from abstract curiosity to physical verification. Cost crystallizes when villagers enter—sacrificing the framer's controlled methodology for communal vulnerability—"careful feet" replacing his initial precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pricked names" as "dotted constellations" reframes silence as accumulated care. Final shop note avoids moralizing by embodying the non-literal answer—"Open to history, open to quiet"—reweighting the map's tear as invitation rather than wound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "lamps warming peeled paint until faces emerged" shows professional bias. Rhythmic control peaks during seam discovery ("hushed threading... breath moving through unseen embroidery") with compression taught early via "shielded openness" framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "sheep threaded between stones like needles in old hands" demonstrates high-density imagery. Minor cadence dip in "methodically curious" repetition avoids scaffold by anchoring to physical action (video comparison → seam tracing).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms chapel trope through architectural hush and cartographic obsession. Fresh synthesis in "wound is also a seam" reweights mapmaking as relational act. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry—silence as data source feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
