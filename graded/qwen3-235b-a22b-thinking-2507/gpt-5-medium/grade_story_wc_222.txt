<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cautious abandon" and trembling hands during swaps; the final renunciation of wages feels earned through prior penance promises, avoiding stock thief tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands flawlessly: the queen swap makes "wrongness pour out as starlings" with visible cost in the sundial's silence, under unbroken Causal lens from first pawn touch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid constrains every choice—its constellation cracks and notch fit directly enable the climax, charging the final image where its light "threw into the rafters" to wake the bell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the thief's agency: each swap narrows options (e.g., pawn's vow requires aloud reading), culminating in the queen's impossible demand to "embrace unknown," paid with silence as tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "swapping words with weather" reweights "apprentice of wonder" into earned play-as-prayer, avoiding moralizing while the final silence answers the wind's letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"thawwater leaving tight throat" embodies the pawn's moan through thief's lexicon; rhythm compresses under pressure ("drip, and time began ticking audibly") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "sacredly playful" risks abstraction but is saved by immediate concrete action ("monks teaching sparrows to bow"), though one borderline lyric phrase prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes thief tropes into "amending catalog of thefts" with weather-as-memory; the chessboard's "squares widening to mouths" transforms a familiar object into indispensable closure imagery.</comment>
