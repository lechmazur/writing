<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I doubt as a way to listen" and refusal of quick flood, but water woman's philosophical question risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in that beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with visible cost ("work was slow... none dared disturb"), perfectly calibrated to Accumulative lens where breadcrumb sequence tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fountains aren't backdrop but active constraint—dry rill, fish tiles, and drain where ruby oval appears directly shape Ilias' breadcrumb navigation, charging the final image where "pigeons bathed like princes" as trickle returns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Broker confrontation crystallizes the core trade-off between "quick flood" and slow remembrance under Accumulative pressure, but secondary stake ("last story cracked") lacks concrete on-page test before resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Patience was not waiting but remembering together" emerges organically from mortar repairs and syllable-counting, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "sidereal patience" through geese returning as city remembers its routes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("colors trembled on stone," "vapor on tile") and rhythmic control persist through peak stress (broker refusal), with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the final "until rain" cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pigeons bathed like princes" exemplifies textural specificity. Only minor deduction: "realistically imaginative" repetition edges toward template cadence in broker confrontation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "skeptic" trope through "doubt as a way to listen" and sidereal patience as civic action; broker's arc (grandmother's smile → counting syllables) risks sentimentality but earns emotional truth through lime-mortar texture.</comment>
