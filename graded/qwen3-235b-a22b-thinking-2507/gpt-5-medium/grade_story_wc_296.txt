<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("warlike serenity" vs. "unmilitant notch") shown through embodied action ("spine rise like a mast"), but mayor's transformation lacks layered emotional contradiction; "trembles" oversimplifies his cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies through "expanding circles" until CR closure ("circles widen and stay calm after battle") with visible cost—the mayor's shattered facade and druid's unbending heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard vortex constrains every choice (mapping currents, seed deployment); final "ordinary halos" recharges the setting's meaning while the coin from trees charges deliverance's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through druid's agency (deploying seed), but mayor's confession resolution relies slightly on the seed's external action; cost ("trembles," "breathes them fully") feels earned though minimally visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "truths bite back" theme emerges through the seed's action and final image ("circles widen... calm after battle"), reweighting "warlike serenity" as earned vulnerability without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalog them by the ache") with rhythmic control under pressure; elision of magic trick's failure taught early and paid off in "mirrors turned face down" closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("frozen confession stalled where the mayor tried to speak") with clear propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent phrases, but closure imagery remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic ecology and political corruption; "flesh-eating seed" transforms trope through specific logic (eats only lies). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry ("apples orbit like moons" as charged micro-setting).</comment>
