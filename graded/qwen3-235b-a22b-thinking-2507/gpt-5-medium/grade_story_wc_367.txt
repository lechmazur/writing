<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shadowed elation" and accidental prophecies, but "ancient shadows" motivation lacks concrete friction; child relationship deepens stakes with soup-feeding micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands in final vow with conceptual cost ("weathered joy"); Accumulative lens holds through patterned light-steering beats; cost proof in "ballast" laughter anchoring against melancholy sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald glass bones constrain steering choices and charge the final vow; tactile details like "cheek against green coolness" evolve causally from bottle-archives to beacon foundation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "braid of fused silica fibers drinks light like rain" compresses physics and poetry without muddle; final line's "emerald vow" recharges opening shadows with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via "total internal reflection" physics and post-print context; "kelp-haired child" synthesizes news/prophecy into fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
