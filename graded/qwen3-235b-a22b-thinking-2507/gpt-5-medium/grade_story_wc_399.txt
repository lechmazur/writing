<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (guiding walker, anchoring points), but prophet remains atmospheric rather than active despite "absence that hums," slightly weakening motivation's causal chain in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: "Tomorrow we will do it again" crystallizes refusal to abandon ritual with visible cost (fatigue, valley's forgetfulness), perfectly calibrated to Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet constrains every major choice (walker reading motion, sewing calm into air), charging the final image as it "settles like an animal"—environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through midday wind "wanting to scatter vowels," forcing protagonist agency (anchoring points) that narrows options; cost is visceral in "strangely honest in his fatigue" during the sewing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "blare collapses, echo endures" dramatized by ink handling and wind resistance, with final image ("echo settle against my ribs") resonating without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("creek hiding under planks," "talons folding"), with rhythmic control tightening during wind crisis; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("feet blackened by drift soot and quiet intention" does triple duty), figurative language never muddles even in peak beats like "sew calm into the air."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via kinetic parapet mechanics and peripheral awareness method; specificity ("mask divides his face," "drift soot") avoids abstraction while risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
