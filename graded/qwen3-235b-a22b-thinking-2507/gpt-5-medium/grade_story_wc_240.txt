<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("teach farm to listen without fear"/"loosen grip") and embodied grief ("unhooking tight dress") earn closure; Kian reflection anchors micro-choice (cat coaxing) without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("neither harder nor softer, simply more true") under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via mist/thread/cable sag; "quiet wildfire" crystallizes reconfigured stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm constrains every choice (spore sensors, slate glow paths); "cracked laser pointer" charges final image ("light as falling permission"); humidity/herbal/damp shifts mirror emotional calibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (security vs. permeability) deepen through cat anomaly; Mara’s agency tightens pressure via laser adjustments; cost legible in "lungs remembering how to exhale" as system reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fungal physics ("water finding shape") not moralizing; final image reweights "letting go" as lattice openness without sentimentality; "membranes vs. walls" crystallizes without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("perimeters as melodies") persists under stress; "sag of cable" spatial choreography tracks; lyric compression ("damp turned herbal") taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "practical embroidery" metaphor integrates action; minor overwriting risk in "quiet wildfire" offset by payoff; final line ("edges again") avoids closure muddle with precise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion detection with fungal networks; "feral cat as known anomaly" transforms security tropes; emotional specificity in "tight dress stitched around heart" avoids generic grief.</comment>
