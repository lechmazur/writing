<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "keeping distance to love" powerfully embodies the core conflict, though "featherly determined" leans label-like without sufficient action demonstration in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("I breathed in that ache"), the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through wood-code alignment, and the terrace's final movement reconfigures the sacred threshold concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wooden bench functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tracing grain to read codes) and charges the final image ("kept the pattern for whoever comes next"), fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement with vivid sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase (codes aligning with wood grain) successfully reweights the "necessary distances" stake, though the lack of tangible opposition slightly weakens pressure legibility under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the terrace/seam threshold metaphor; the final line ("field postponed its welcome") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "sacred thresholds" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sap knot to sap knot, the memory of storms spoke") with rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful compression taught early (logbook codes) pays off in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with exceptional propulsion, though "prism terrace slowly sailing" risks slight overwriting in the opening beat without immediate grounding in character action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corn maze architecture with meteorological codes transforms familiar "search for father" tropes; the "necessary distances" concept feels inevitable through specific, lived detail rather than abstraction.</comment>
