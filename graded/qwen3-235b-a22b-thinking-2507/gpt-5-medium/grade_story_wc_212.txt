<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("furiously tranquil" hands), but grandmother's off-page influence slightly overshadows active micro-choices during vortex stabilization; "texture of borrowed time" risks thematic echo without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "city beyond panes tip toward spring"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly with density building to cap-planting, though "tiny room reopen to birdsong" slightly dilutes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains every action (frost-veined windows guiding light, breath-fog prayers); acorn cap evolves from pocket token to wheel hub to hearth, charging the final planting with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as vortex unfurls ("seeds align, from amaranth skulls to beans"), narrowing options to humming sequences; cost legible in "thaw a promise" but secondary entropy concept lacks mid-beat pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "keeping is not storage but song" reweights prior vault failure without moralizing; final cap-planting answers "texture of borrowed time" with roots "solving the dark."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "breath hangs like frost-laced bells" and "citrus shivers"; rhythmic control peaks with "roots braid through years of rubble" under pressure, no elision untaught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("pinwheel of germs of forests yet to be"), but "texture of borrowed time" strains lexicon in high-stakes beat; "wild serenity" slightly abstracts the creature's physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via seed-vortex biology; "decreasing entropy" as unlocking mechanism feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in conceptual closure ("solve the dark" arithmetic).</comment>
