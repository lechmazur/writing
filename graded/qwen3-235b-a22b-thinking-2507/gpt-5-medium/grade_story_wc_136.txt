<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "analytically artistic" tension—e.g., tracing arrows while "letting instinct sharpen measured stride." Final renunciation of rigid mapping earns closure via map-folding action with visceral cost ("constellations of avoided conversations" on skin).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "Unbutton them, and step through where lines resist closure softly" crystallizes stance with felt cost (surrendering patterns). Accumulative lens holds—arrows/punch density escalates pressure toward reconfiguration, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phantom ticket punch constrains every key choice: pressing it "clips circles from darkness," later offered as proof. Final image charges closure—maps folded until "lost borders" directly reweights opening cobblestone maps with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "aligning arrows, aligning heartbeat" forecloses avoidance path. Cost legible when "constellations resolve into ramparts"—avoided conversations become literal barriers, altering tactics (folding maps) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "hang each unsaid word on stars like lanterns" reweights silence without moralizing. Final image—"promising routes etched with kinder measures"—resonates as non-literal answer to central conflict (rigidity vs. emotional openness).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in cartographer’s gaze: "cracks in pavement forming arrows" filters setting through profession. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when train "moved without mechanical motion," compressing diction while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chalk, rain, and something like thunder" achieves textural specificity. Near-miss: "trembling certainty" repetition risks templating but earns resonance through closure reprise ("answered with trembling certainty" → final step).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms mapping tropes via "spaces between lines" premise. Fresh inflection: phantom punch as emotional ledger. Risk-taking heightens stakes—abstract "fortress" rendered tangible through pavement arrows and skin constellations without gimmickry.</comment>
