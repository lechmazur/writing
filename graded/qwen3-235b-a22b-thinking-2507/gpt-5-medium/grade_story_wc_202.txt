<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "keep still while moving" and "paid in awakenings," but micro-struggle under pressure lacks escalation; "anchors of intuition" drives choices yet internal conflict remains observational rather than visceral during pivotal lens placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: naming the child reconfigures the painting's anonymity with felt cost ("swallowed two worlds"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation in brushstrokes-to-breath transformation; cost legible in the painter's lowered eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (handling linen-wrapped shard) and charges closure by making "letters rise like fish." Market ropes actively pressure movement ("wind pulled on suspended market ropes"), elevating beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: translating pigment into coordinates requires swallowing sensory "tar of wharves," narrowing options to verbal offering. Conceptual cost ("the sea practiced forgetting her") reweights closure under Accumulative lens without physical action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pigments mixed with river ash" becomes non-literal answer to honoring overlooked histories. Final image ("Her name surfaced twice, as if practicing survival") reweights memory without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "weather held in linen" and "steam into cups shaped like gulls" persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in closure cadence ("suddenly the scene quit drowning"); no head-hopping despite painter's presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "shy, silver" fish metaphor propels closure with precision. One abstraction ("anchors of intuition") slightly dulls pressure in high-stakes beat, preventing 10.0. Sentence rhythm accelerates during name recovery ("gathered them before they fell back").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator archetype with material specificity ("berry salts, old recipes for remembering"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure transforms "elusively tangible" into emotional truth; no derivative tropes despite lighthouse motif.</comment>
