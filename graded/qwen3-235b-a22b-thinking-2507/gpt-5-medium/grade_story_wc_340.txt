<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("seek joy beneath anguish") drives concrete micro-choices like angling goggles and arranging letters, not clutching them. Contradictory impulses (detachment vs. affection) manifest physically in "slant from myth" and "voice hum small reassurances." Final renunciation of clutching earns visible cost but flaw embodiment lacks visceral stakes beyond restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "do not clutch... arrange them," reconfiguring grief/joy under Accumulative lens. Floor-by-floor accumulation tightens focus through scattered-light mechanics. Minor escalation lacks narrowing options, capping near 9.0 despite flawless cost legibility at "bolts from tiring."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively constrains tactics: frost flowers necessitate goggles for light refraction, while elevator gears mirror servant's "toothy grin." Final image charges setting via "bolts from tiring," proving environment shapes closure. Whale oil smell and mica filigree integrate with decryption stakes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (joy beneath anguish) escalate through servant's agency: angling goggles, unfolding parcels, and pulse-aligned cipher choices deepen knowledge. Cost crystallizes in restraint ("do not clutch") altering tactics. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks narrowing options beyond emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through decryption mechanics: scattered light revealing glyphs mirrors "joy smuggled into harsh weather." Final image ("joy keeps bolts from tiring") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing joy as active practice ("arrange them") rather than abstract concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lens glass crazed like thawing lakes" and glyphs "drowse awake," reflecting servant's inquisitive warmth. Rhythm modulates from "elevator hums" to "confetti" snow, compressing stress without POV drift. Elisions (Mirek's backstory) taught early via diary margins and paid off in cipher wheel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minimal loops but "frostbitten rail" and "borrowed from cold saints" risk mixed metaphor. Overwriting in "cathedral that forgot applause" slightly muddles physical logic. Final lines achieve propulsion ("leave diary open... bolts from tiring") yet earlier density occasionally obscures cause/effect (e.g., "grief and laughter share a shelf").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator-as-throat framing transforms grief into decryption mechanics. Tropes (lost diary, ice spire) personalized through "scattered light" physics and "pulse-aligned" humor. Risks poetic density without gimmickry, following implications via servant's tactile choices. Avoids safety middle with bold "joy beneath anguish" premise.</comment>
