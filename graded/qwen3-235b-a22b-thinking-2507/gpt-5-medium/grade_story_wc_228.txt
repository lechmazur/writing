<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "intimately aloof" actions versus salt-ghost compulsion; micro-choices like kneeling with the shell embody the vow's cost without therapy-speak. "Vanishing into copies" skirts diagnostic label territory but escapes penalty through wet-finger drawing action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: backing away from the corridor crystallizes the artistic stance with "keeping the promise means not living in the painting." Causal lens holds perfectly from cracked mirror to earned departure, with tide timing as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The painted seashell functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice—dipping it in the oasis, using it to draw—culminating in the final image where it "is warm with its small moon." Salt ghosts and mineral syllables transform setting into active pressure rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: the wrong turn forces confrontation with the pool's reflection, narrowing options to either vanish into copies or relinquish the corridor. Cost is unmistakable in the physical act of leaving "as the corridor closes," reweighting the vow through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the shell’s transformation—from painted reminder to dipped vessel to final warmth—avoiding moralizing. The ending’s "harbor as it inhales and exhales" offers resonant CR: art requires non-ownership, with conceptual cost legible in the unsigned painting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is painterly yet precise: "tidal shards," "slick alphabet on stones," "mineral syllables." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("I kneel... dip... touch... draw") with no head-hopping; voice modulates from aloofness to awe without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lacquer catches hints of light" and "light and shadow trade hands" exemplify high-density propulsion. Final line’s "warm with its small moon" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure—no artifacts dull the cost in the departure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "artist’s block" through maritime specificity: painting the sea’s interior becomes literalized in the corridor. Risk-taking (cave as studio) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the "quince" detail slightly edges toward ornamental freshness.</comment>
