<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "written against the current" versus market pressure, but "lucidly watchful" remains stated not embodied; micro-choices like taking emblems lack concrete physicality under pressure despite strong thematic alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when protagonist chooses "the river" over market demands, with cost legible in "footsteps and pauses, nothing ornamental"; Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to river immersion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spiral shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (clicking metronome) and charges final image ("pockets bright with offerings"); mist evolves from atmospheric detail to "legible silence" shaping the pivotal river crossing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase reweights "collecting shapes of hopes" stake through cameo arrivals; cost crystallizes when market's "ladder of triumphs" contrasts with river's "footsteps," narrowing options to irreversible artistic stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shapes of different hopes" motif charged by emblems' weight/lightness duality; avoids moralizing by showing "sanding edges" cost in river immersion rather than stating artistic integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "shoreline holds the rumor of tides" synesthesia; rhythmic control shifts from "swirling hush" to "articulate chill" under pressure without head-hopping in Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion except "bee bright" metaphor slightly jars lexicon; zero loops but "forever hallway with many doors" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat, capped just below 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Risk-taking elevates through Accumulative structure where cameos aren't characters but "fragments" that deepen stakes; transforms "against current" trope via river/road braiding that charges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
