<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "scheming pacifist" concept; Rell's embodied "prickles" and jaw tension avoid therapy-speak. Final kneeling earns closure through cellular memory trigger, though protagonist's interiority remains slightly distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Rell kneels to "return unspent years," with visceral cost in "resentment loosens from his tongue like old thread." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout via sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary functions as micro-setting: the mute music box constrains choice (Rell's flinch) and charges the final image (box-as-compass). Sensory hierarchy—factory dust on mother's hand—anchors emotional stakes without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (releasing resentment) tightens via Rell's physical reaction to the broken pin, escalating to factory memory immersion. Cost is undeniable in "prickles unwind," though agency leans slightly passive under sanctuary's guided pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "arithmetic of absences" and cellular memory—not stated morals. Final image (mute box as compass) reweights resentment as navigable, avoiding sentimentality while charging prior material with "silence ring[ing] until remembered hands arrive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("walls soften like breath," "silence hums like breath held") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in factory sequence where lyric compression pays off closure; no head-hopping despite second character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "belts carry not metal, but the breath" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "shifting grace" repetition (-0.1), but final line’s "unsung melody pace my own bones" achieves crystalline closure resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "healing sanctuary" trope through broken music box mechanics and cellular memory specificity. Risk-taking in soundless setting deepens stakes without gimmickry; "factory rows inside him" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh imagery.</comment>
