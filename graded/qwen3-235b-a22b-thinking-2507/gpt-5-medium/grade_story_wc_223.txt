<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "crisis actor real crisis survivor" and shedding victim costume, but secondary characters lack distinct voices beyond functional roles; micro-choices like "cutting apologies while holding elbows" reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when narrator chooses to "travel with nomadic penumbra," making cost legible through "corridor full of legible silence" and visible forfeiture of historian role; Accumulative lens holds with spelling sequences tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's marble rim and chessboard scuffs function as micro-setting that charges final image; "taped shoes skidding" and "pocketed salt" constrain choices while embodying the "small gestures" theme with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through spelling sequences ("water" to "stay" to "hush") deepens dominant stake of preserving unrecorded humanity under Accumulative lens; cost crystallizes when narrator forecloses historian identity for nomadic witness, though interregnum pressure lacks tangible opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "legible silence" and traveling penumbra offers non-literal answer to archival dilemma; theme emerges through concrete acts like warming hands with salt rather than abstraction, avoiding moralizing despite high lyric density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "luminous absence that refused to be empty" and rhythm modulates under pressure; controlled elision ("real blast braided my lungs with phrases") taught early pays off in closure's resonant compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "scuffed by hands that once waited their turn" exemplifies high-density prose; only minor risk in "luminous absence" bordering abstraction, but "refused to be empty" grounds it in character-specific observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival impulse with embodied gesture ("walking that spells words"); risk-taking heightens stakes through "nomadic penumbra" as active metaphor rather than passive mood, transforming crisis documentation tropes via tactile specificity.</comment>
