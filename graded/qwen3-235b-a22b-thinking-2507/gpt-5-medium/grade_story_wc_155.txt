<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet doesn't intensify under pressure. The fresco fragment anchors emotion but doesn't drive pivotal choices like film restoration. No flaw-driven mistakes complicate the process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "the orchard district looked briefly dressed again" crystallizes ephemeral joy with felt cost ("pockets smelling of pith and laughter"). Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative lens held throughout without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog actively constrains tactics (as screen) and charges the final image; pomegranate seeds evolve from static shard to "urgent punctuation" reweighting joy's fragility. Micro-setting (fresco fragment) directly enables color correction choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (lost joy) deepens through community corrections narrowing options—e.g., "boy with wings" becoming mirror maker forces artistic recalibration. Cost manifests in joy's fragility ("pockets smelling of pith"), earned through protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "laughter has weight" motif; final image reweights pomegranate seeds as "urgent punctuation," offering non-literal answer about joy's collaborative, transient nature without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("fog hung like old theater curtains"); rhythmic control deepens under pressure with purposeful compression ("time kinked"). "Daydream that hummed" early teaches temporal distortion paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; only minor structural repetition in "fog made my studio... lanes my corridor..." (line 7). Zero figurative muddle in peak beats—e.g., "film remembered its path, looping into a circle" crystallizes closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms muralist trope via "painting with light" and collective memory; joy's fragility avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric structure, community as co-creator) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise lacks one fresh inflection beyond execution.</comment>
