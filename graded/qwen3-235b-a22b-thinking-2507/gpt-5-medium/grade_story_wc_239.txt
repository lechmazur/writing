<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("I am the end of history witness") with minimal contradictory impulses; epiphany at lectern feels unearned despite strong embodied moments like circling "to make room within" under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the dizziness of broken sequence fade" crystallizes conceptual cost of becoming the "hinge," with Accumulative/Textural lens holding through the spiral's reconfiguration of time/memory stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple library functions as essential micro-setting: meteor stone lectern and spiral floor constrain choices (exits leading through center), while the dictionary's physicality charges the final image when placed beneath the scroll.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist's attention ("walking the spiral to bind what could be recalled") narrows options under Accumulative lens; conceptual cost of "dizziness fading" unmistakably reweights the final image's "world inhaled" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the deferred civilization's scroll reweights "listen" without moralizing; final image "world inhaled as if remembering how" offers resonant answer to central question of memory's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "letters looked wanderingly exact," though slight academic drift in "by training and by accident" momentarily disrupts voice; rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional throughout the spiral walk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "nations ended, lovers forgot, and echoes took the seats of kings" propels momentum without muddying closure, though one minor academic register slip ("by training and by accident") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "library witness" trope through cosmic stakes and emotional specificity of "deferred" civilizations; "journeying inward while walking out" synthesizes physical/spiritual action in a fresh, inevitable way without gimmickry.</comment>
