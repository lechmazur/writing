<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in his broker-to-witness arc; embodied emotion in "whispered nothing" and "tolerable stings" shows cost without therapy-speak. Flaw: Ghosts' pressure lacks tangible opposition beyond his own guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when he opens the box—"colors flooded...glowed like honey reborn"—with visible cost in his whispered complicity. Accumulative lens holds: sensory density (ash swirls, shadow angles) tightens toward this irreversible act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The skeletal comb lectern constrains choice (holds the box) and charges the final image when bees "traced his wrists." Apiary setting evolves from "burnt hives" to "crumbling constellations," directly enabling the covenant’s resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by his agency: queen’s arrival forces reexamination of the covenant. Cost is unmistakable—"Loss was not abstract; it had a ledger and a signature he had worn"—as he slides the lid open, accepting complicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of the "narrow stripe of blue" road answers the central question ("keep what cannot be said") through resonant action, not moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars like the hexagon sigil, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ash swirled, angle of shadow") reflects his beekeeper-broker duality. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short clauses during the queen’s arrival ("She haltingly lifted...") contrast with lyrical closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("mosaicking silence into fragments of concentrated daybreak"). Minor scaffold in "He was tranquilly perceptive, as if..." slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t obscure closure’s warmth imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes apocalyptic tropes through beekeeping specificity ("lectern" of comb, "orchard contracts"). Risk-taking (ghosts as "mute eloquence") heightens stakes without gimmickry; the covenant’s moral weight feels earned, not derivative.</comment>
