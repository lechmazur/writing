<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's "mathematics of fair trade" motivation drives concrete choices, but Arman remains underdeveloped as passive prop; micro-choices like signing witness with vintage ink reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ink pot's "tides that answer to hands" reconfigures fairness with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic "waiting actively" pressure; breach timing slightly convenient but redeemed by felt cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room constrains choices (service elevator, gel-cold skin), but vintage ink pot as micro-setting charges closure decisively; "deathly vitality" anchors sensory specificity though occupational details lack early tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "waiting actively" rhythm toward breach, but security camera "blinks politely" undercuts tension; cost of father's legacy is legible though breach timing feels slightly convenient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of ink pot "tides" reweights fairness theme without moralizing; "invisible passport of touch" crystallizes concept through action; "mathematics" metaphor risks abstraction but redeemed by ledger's tangible proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: "pumps cough, vents sigh" shows distinct perceptual signature; "inverse function" momentarily drifts academic but rhythm control sustains Accumulative lens through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquefies rigid thinking" is only questionable phrase but integrated purposefully; final line "new vowel of fairness" achieves crystalline density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms asylum trope through funeral home lens; ink pot as moral compass feels fresh; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry though "mathematics" framing borders on familiar.</comment>
