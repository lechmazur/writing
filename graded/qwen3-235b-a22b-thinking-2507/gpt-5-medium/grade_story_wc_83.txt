<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "laughter tries to grow where sorrow sits" but "bleak exhilaration" risks label-speak; geode-as-oracle embodies trauma without diagnostic language yet wedding backstory lacks dramatized choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("wounded hymn" reweights "unused potential"), but commander's role creates minor stake ambiguity; Accumulative lens holds through basin discovery's data-chart blurring and moth-light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode crystal charges final image ("small cathedral keeping vigil") while constraining choices—light through facets bends attention during basin sequence; observatory's silent fans evolve from tool to living entity as it "tilts like a witness".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via basin discovery where "stairsteps of data blur" into actionable intelligence, but commander's misunderstanding of "price" lacks visible consequence; cost is felt through shoulder's "blazing corridor" yet remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unspent will of world" motif reweighted by final "grip forming in the dark"—no moralizing, but "bruise that reads the weather" slightly strains organic emergence; closure answers "where potential pools" with visceral lift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "circuit breakers cool like ice forming inside iron ribcage"; compression taught early pays off in "moth colored light" sequence, though "intangibly tangible" repetition risks voice convergence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("data blur; a basin appears where once there was a cliff"), but "intangibly tangible" appears twice with minimal variation; final image avoids figurative muddle despite "wounded hymn" abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perturbation theory with trauma avoids physics clichés, yet "bruise that never fades" leans toward trope; geode's dual role as compass/oracle transforms "unused potential" concept with emotional specificity.</comment>
