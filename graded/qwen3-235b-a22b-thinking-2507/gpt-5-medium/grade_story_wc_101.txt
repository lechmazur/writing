<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s "gently persistent" trait drives concrete choices (pairing teens/elders, declaring dignity) with embodied cost during patrol confrontation; single-POV limits interior contradiction but micro-choices under pressure (timing runs, recording exchanges) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: bell’s final polishing reconfigures meaning from survival tool to communal gratitude with undeniable conceptual cost (shift from "frost prints" to "faces wobbled there"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-setting constraining choices (donation logistics, patrol evasion) and charging closure; "frost prints" to "wind could ring thanks" evolution mirrors emotional thaw with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patrol confrontation escalates sanctions pressure into visible cost (Mara’s silent defiance forcing tactical refinement), narrowing options through Accumulative deepening; "fewer lists, fewer boots" lands conceptual price without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final bell image reweights "anonymous donations" into earned intergenerational trust without moralizing; "scarcity braided with care" emerges organically from knitted sweaters/rhyming lessons, avoiding thematic echo despite dialogue proximity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pad-soft steps," "bruised clocks of infants") sustains Accumulative rhythm; "amplified quiet" motif modulates from brittle fear to resonant hope without POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "carrot tops under snow" and "winter lung kept working" achieve high density with visceral propulsion; single borderline overwritten phrase ("nerves stretched thin... blistered everything") avoids penalty via voice consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell as "bridge rung into air" transforms anonymity trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure (patrol as density peak, not reversal) heightens stakes without gimmickry, resisting abstraction through "kerosene pooled in jars."</comment>
