<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("cautiously hopeful" vs shelving hope), embodied in "breathed in dust and stubbornness" before interference. Micro-choices like tuning transmitters with mittens reveal values, but cosmic trickster lacks concrete opposition reducing relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost: rejecting committee chair for "breakfast without chair" crystallizes stakes. Lens (Accumulative) holds through density buildup, but cost ("messy, slower, unowned") feels slightly abstract versus tangible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting constraint elevates: astronomical charts evolve from "tea-stained maps" to closure annotation charging final image. Radio studio pressures choices ("duct tape spelled warnings" on cables), with "breath" motif concretely shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation ("broadcast countersigns"), narrowing options via subsonic interference. Cost legible in rejected tenure, but signal's escalation lacks visceral narrowing—pressure accumulates without sufficient tactical constraint shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "breath" motif's evolution: from signal's manipulation to final annotation "teach people their breath." Avoids moralizing; Charged Poise ending reweights discourse without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static had tempers; silence had accents") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("hiss became breath... sound of deciding"), with elision ("two shards" of studio/theater) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("peeled," "hummed," "tugged"). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting. Minor deduction: "cosmic tricksters teach you with your own echo" slightly abstract but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes radio trope with academic politics into fresh "ethereal grit." "Teach people their breath" reconfigures power dynamics through specific campus details (janitor switching lights, councilmember's pancake request).</comment>
