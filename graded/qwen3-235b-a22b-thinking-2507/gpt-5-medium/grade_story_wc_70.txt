<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands" embodies involuntary candor’s push-pull. Final choice (revealing box) earns endurance via established ritual stance, with cost legible in "truth leaves no pocket for delay." No diagnostic labels muddy peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Mara left... I took my place again" crystallizes refusal to abandon ritual, with cost in vulnerability of the reveal. Orientation nailed by word 20 ("lightning collection tower"), accumulative lens held through sensory density ("steel smelled faintly of bloom") without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lacquer box functions as micro-setting that constrains climax action ("Open it, she said") and charges final image ("steel smelled faintly of bloom"). Lightning tower pressures choices (stair access, capacitor location), avoiding postcard description through tactical integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ritual vs. urgency) tightens when Mara solves riddle, narrowing options to reveal box or risk desecration. Cost—toll keeper’s vulnerability—is unmistakable in "truth leaves no pocket for delay," though accumulative escalation lacks one palpable physical price beyond emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wonder prefers careful company" earned by Mara’s calibration scene, not stated. Final image reweights "why we build jars for lightning" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite Mara’s "charge for stories" line being character-specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "paper moth of a riddle," "stormfruit" rods. Syntax modulates under pressure (short imperatives: "Open it. I could not refuse"). Dialogue voices diverge cleanly—Mara’s technical precision ("harmonics housing") vs. toll keeper’s lyricism—without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystal wafer cradled by dark wood" during climax). Final line "steel smelled faintly of bloom" crystallizes theme without muddling action. Figurative language ("thrum like bees discovering meadow") enhances propulsion, never obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "involuntarily truthful" toll keeper transforms eco-tech tropes through ritual stakes. Emotional specificity in "fields answer with silence" avoids generic allegory. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, though drone premise echoes mild familiarity despite transformation.</comment>
