<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son") drives micro-choices like lattice placement, but motivation ("chasing hush") remains abstract despite embodied details like counting tide beats. Emotional progression lacks concrete cost in key beats, with "thread a labyrinth" telling rather than showing stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully when narrator covers the drain ("surrendered without words"), reweighting truth as "brine of a promise kept" with felt cost. Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3) caps score despite valid Accumulative/Textural escalation through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lattice constrains three key choices (confessional, speaking tube, drain) and charges the final image where it "turns the knobs" on hidden truth. Copper roof heat and salt-locked doors actively shape tactics, with sensory details ("surf speaking in a low sleepwalk") reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. protective silence) tightens meaningfully when boat approaches, forcing narrator's lens-like measured response. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure before this beat; "bodies under stairs" introduced too late to deepen tactics earlier despite conceptual cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: lattice transforms from confessional tool to truth-concealer, reweighting "hush" as active protection. Avoids moralizing but final image ("hush would be guiding them") slightly overstates resonance without sufficient prior tension in the calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("surf speaking in a low sleepwalk," "gulls nod at wrecks") modulates perfectly under pressure. Rhythmic control in closure beat ("light through in segments that made a beam") teaches and pays off patterned elision, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copperlight repose" and "jar keeps a firefly" achieve high density without muddle. Slight overwriting risk in "hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup in hands," but rhythmic propulsion and concrete verbs ("set the lattice across") dominate peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms prison tropes through specific details like salt-green locks and map-buried iron. Emotional truth in "truth can taste like iron" avoids genericity, but "cry wolf" motif risks template familiarity without sufficient fresh inflection beyond the lighthouse's physical constraints.</comment>
