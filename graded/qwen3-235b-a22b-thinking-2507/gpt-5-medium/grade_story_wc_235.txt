<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly ("jealous of past selves" vs. present clarity), but minor abstraction in "continuity is a trick river" slightly dilutes embodied cost. Final choice to patrol after funeral earns endurance through micro-choices like bargaining with nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: grave "waited without accusation" while protagonist packs scroll, accepting cyclical time. Cost is palpable in "jaded wonder" coffee—bitter yet sweet. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as dates reconfigure meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cabin stove and birch bark scroll constrain choices (e.g., brewing tea as patience ritual) and charge the final image: scroll packed with first aid kit. Snow's evolution from "rasped windows" to "sentinel" mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: bargaining with nostalgia narrows options to acceptance ("did not resurrect myself; I only gave endings a place to meet beginnings"). Cost crystallizes in "bitter as spruce pitch" coffee—visceral and inextricable from the final patrol decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (tracing erratic dates), not abstraction. Final image—"patrol the day after my own funeral"—resonates as non-literal answer to temporal disorientation, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow hissed like applause withheld"; "ravens rehearsed insults until poems") sustains under pressure. Minor register drift in "continuity is a trick river" slightly jars, but rhythmic control elevates compression into purposeful lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("I wrote fast... I wrote slow"). Figurative language precise ("letters climbed like ants"), though "magnesium" metaphor risks slight abstraction. Propulsion flawless—every line advances atmosphere or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms dream-chronicler trope through ranger specificity ("spruce pitch" coffee, patrol logs). "Feral nostalgia" as active force—not abstract—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, synthesizing time/memory with visceral terrain.</comment>
