<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "measured meals by syllables" and "only holding the air together," but the poet's redemption feels slightly abstract despite embodied details like the widow pressing the box to her chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in the widow's tears and "spaces between them grew fewer," though the music box's activation relies on wind coincidence rather than full protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The feral loft actively constrains survival ("windproof shadows gathered like commas") and charges the ending ("purred like a cat remembering its name"), with saltwood and rope becoming tangible symbols of generational connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the music box's activation, narrowing the poet's options to sharing jars; visible cost manifests in the widow's trembling and the village's "happy ache," though escalation leans slightly passive with wind-triggered discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The final image of the music box "ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet" reweights the translation theme without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while making grief's transformation viscerally resonant through bottled gull bargains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dawn's earliest whistle" and "lonesome splendor" sustains rhythmic control, with zero register drift even during high-pressure beats like the ballerina's bow to the sands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "iron and tea" scent detail exemplifies textural specificity, though "light trembled as if reading a diary" risks slight metaphorical muddle without undermining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "healing through music" via barnacled mechanics and bottled weather, with "translator between generations" made specific through gull bargains conversing with lullabies—no middle-ground hedging.</comment>
