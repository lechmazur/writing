<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (blithe yet shadowed) act in scene; final choice to plant poppies earns closure via prior causality with visible emotional cost ("blithe mask soften into respect"). No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: understanding the widow's deception forecloses ignorance, crystallized in "blithe mask soften into respect." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; chess clock timing drives irreversible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sovereign case and tapestry border constrain choices (catching falling threads, decoding knots) and charge the final image (poppies honoring truth). Micro-setting (needle, thread) directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by gardener's agency: ladder climb tightens options, pulling asters deepens knowledge. Cost unmistakable in emotional shift when recognizing the lie; chess clock creates live pressure narrowing tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final poppy circle offers resonant answer to "shape of intentions" without moralizing. Theme emerges from thread knots as "verbs" and absence-as-truth, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars (burlap sack, deeds).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("velvet unwinding," "migrating birds" echoes) creates distinct texture. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("untangle not by force but by kindness"); elision taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("knots sit like punctuation"). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" territory barely dulls closure. Final line recharges motifs with crystalline precision ("story that has untangled itself").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery trope via thread-as-map mechanics. Fresh inflection in honoring both truth and deception through poppies. Bold risk in quiet closure earns distinction; avoids symbolic convenience.</comment>
