<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("logically emotional") manifest physically in breath control and key offering; seeker's hunger shifting shape shows embodied change with visible cost in her aching smile when returning the key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "help me keep the stone singing only for safety" crystallizes stance with cost ("smile that did not hide its ache"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (stone's chord) reweights the ransom stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains tactics (skiff navigating ice) and charges closure ("drift-ice knocked like neighbors"); recurring key and stone directly shape the final image where lighthouse beam becomes "a rib set back in place."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marek's adaptation choice under Accumulative lens; stake tightening forecloses ransom path when seeker returns key, with palpable cost in her emotional shift and shared responsibility burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image of co-keeping offers resonant answer to power stewardship: "two keepers without malice" reweights "ransom" through concrete labor, avoiding moralizing while charging prior motifs with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("graphed feelings against facts") shapes all description; dialogue carries subtext ("storms behave like creditors") with distinct voice (seeker's "village drowned" vs Marek's vibrational lexicon) under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stone opened its throat" to "lighthouse, relieved, lifted its beam" shows relentless propulsion with high-density imagery that never obscures causality in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through vibrational physics ("sonic absolution"); emotional specificity in both characters' motivations creates fresh synthesis where co-stewardship feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
