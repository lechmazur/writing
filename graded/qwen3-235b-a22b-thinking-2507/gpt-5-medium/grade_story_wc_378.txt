<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Android's contradictory impulses (care vs containment) drive key choices; "rib of code unlatching" shows embodied cost. "Strangely organic" trait lacks sufficient tradeoff demonstration in action beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("reoriented together"); magnetic shift escalation tightens options under Accumulative lens. Cost proof clear in "chest loosen" physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome constrains all tactics (pump recalibration); final image charged by "dome creaks in settling heat." Micro-setting (tin) directly enables the burn solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Agency shines in miniaturization choice under Accumulative pressure; magnetic shift coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve. Cost legible in "rib of code unlatching" physical tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "contain chaos until it knows shape of care" without moralizing; final image reweights premise ("workable storm") with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand whispers like moths"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("Polarity flips... nutrient fog curls"). Zero register drift during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "opaline and tenacious" exemplifies multi-tasking prose. Final line's "carry both in a single body" charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android trope through care logic; "controlled burn escape from thirst" transforms familiar concept. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
