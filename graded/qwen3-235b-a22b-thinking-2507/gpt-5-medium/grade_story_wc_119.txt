<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("accidentally prophetic" vs. desire to "transpose life") drives the final choice. Embodied emotion in "envelope sweating against my ribs" and micro-choices like pocketing the envelope establish authentic struggle without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "You already know" reweights "open secrets" with social cost ("fear goes quiet"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through density (microdots, sugar, light) culminating in the projected message’s felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens actively constrains choices (feeding fortunes to it) and charges the final image ("light scattered over the town"). Specific tools like the fortune-stamping machine drive action, avoiding white-room syndrome with harbor-tide mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: microdot preparation tightens stakes through sensory density ("boiled sugar, inked rice"), narrowing options to the lighthouse projection. Cost is legible in the agent’s misinterpretation ("report that nothing happened... ricochet until admission").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not moralizing: "You already know" answers the central question by reweighting "open secrets" as communal mercy. Avoids thematic echo—no final-paragraph sermon, only resonant image where "rumors... pool where they irrigate the dry."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("neon fizzed out like a tired constellation"; "biscuit that tasted of almonds and warnings") persists under stress. Rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("fed it fortunes as if we were priests") avoids uniformity without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "almonds and warnings" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("tide thought things over") serves momentum without muddle. Final line’s "listened" delivers closure with propulsion, no closure-beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through specific harbor logic (fortunes as microdots, lighthouse as projector). Fresh synthesis: "open secrets" as weather-calming mechanism avoids derivative safety-middle choices while feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
