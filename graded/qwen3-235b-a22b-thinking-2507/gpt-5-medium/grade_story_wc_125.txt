<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "knots I tied to seem heroic" versus present vow; embodied emotion via rope's "warmth of consent" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice of looping rope around waist during peak pressure reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when rope presses against mirror: "felt its old fibers take on warmth of consent" with visible cost of confronting past knots. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through dust-footprint patterning, though clock-prison vision slightly disrupts causal flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto’s chill and dust constrain choice (breathing patterns, footprint weaving) and charge final image where mile markers become "constellations." Rope’s rust/rain smell evolves from prison relic to "warmth of consent," directly shaping the mirror scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of time) tightens via energy being’s canyon/silt vision, forcing moral calculus: "ethics of change are playful or cruel." Cost is legible in "knots I tied to seem heroic," but escalation lacks one visible price paid before the mirror climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "patterning footprints through dust like a loom might weave a childhood" reweights "texture of time" as noticing "alibis." Final vow avoids moralizing by tying "metaphors accountable" to rope’s physical warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "violet arithmetic," "silt that had been mountain, then lake, then field, then throat." Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("silk shawl") to urgent ("tug of the rope... as grammar") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "bruises" metaphor gains precision through canyon/silt imagery. Slight density risk in "braided the night with a history," but momentum holds via concrete verbs ("patterned," "unfurled," "pressed"). Final line’s constellation metaphor crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-discovery trope through grotto’s dust-palimpsest and rope-as-listening. Risk-taking (energy beings as silent partners) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "ethically playful" vow gains freshness via "mercy quick" specificity and rope’s tactile proof.</comment>
