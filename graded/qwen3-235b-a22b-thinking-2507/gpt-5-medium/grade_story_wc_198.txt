<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in sax as both amulet and memory-trigger, but teacher's absence lacks concrete micro-choices; embodied emotion ("memory smells of ash") elevates beyond stock nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "a ring where the sentence nearly closed" reconfigures prophecy with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens held via dewdrop-to-disruption pattern without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains every choice (sound must "climb the glass"), culminating in final image where "absence I have made" charges the glass panels; micro-setting gate met with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prophecy's progression creates relentless Accumulative pressure, but "listeners beyond the ridge" lack tangible escalation; cost is legible via "threadbare law" yet secondary pressure feels underdeveloped at peak stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Vested hush" evolves from garment metaphor to lived oath without moralizing; final line ("the oath holds") resonates as non-literal answer to secrecy vs. memory, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "light quietly vivid, as if past rinsed"; rhythmic control under pressure ("sound go wandering... blur the joining") with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "condensation joining points like constellations" achieves textural density without muddle; minor deduction for doubled "eerie nostalgia" phrasing in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via saxophonist's negative-space method; fresh synthesis of music/fog/prophecy feels inevitable, though risk-taking stops short of radical structural innovation.</comment>
