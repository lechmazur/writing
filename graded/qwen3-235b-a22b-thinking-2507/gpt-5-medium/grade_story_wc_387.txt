<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("demure audacity") manifests in micro-choices like the councilor confrontation; embodied grief ("coaxing grief into spirals") avoids labels; flaws compound when public skepticism tests motivation without retreat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the child receiving the whisk reweights "hidden effort" with undeniable social cost (sash repurposed for service); Accumulative lens holds as density shifts from observation to collective action with visible cost on the final stones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet runoff patterns directly constrain the teaching method; the bamboo whisk charges the final image ("cradles it like a crab") while evolving from tool to heirloom; firefly season's ephemerality tightens the demonstration's stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: councilor's "fireworks" skepticism forces the narrator to deepen the demonstration into participatory labor, narrowing options to collective action with visible cost (sash drying stones).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (night sweeper, hinge-oiler) avoiding moralizing; the final image ("tomorrow, for hands") offers non-literal answer to "hidden effort" by reweighting the whisk's purpose without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("water threads... murmuring like apprentices gossiping") filters all detail through the mender's tactile worldview; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical reflection to urgent action ("We pour tea for each ghost of labor") without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "whisk spins, a hummingbird trapped in duty" demonstrates high-density propulsion; only minor artifact: "scintillatingly somber" repetition slightly dulls the closure beat's novelty despite thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "appreciate labor" trope through specific tools (bamboo whisk as "pocket lighthouse"); risk-taking in quiet climax ("we do not clap") heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through moon-path motif.</comment>
