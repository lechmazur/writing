<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (archivist duty vs. protecting future children) act simultaneously in the prophecy confrontation; the refusal to record earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in "roots crack the rooftop" consequences. Flaw: Field trip memory reflection slightly overextends BRR limits without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when folding the parchment—"future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath"—with undeniable conceptual cost in altered timelines. Orientation anchors instantly ("After foghorn falls silent"), and Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the humming of the harbor note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cracked basin constrains choice throughout (immersing fingers, sinking wax thread, carrying echoes against thumbbones) and charges the final image where water "soften[s] back into rain." Orchards' "velvet disquiet" evolves from atmospheric detail to active pressure as branches "bend from a wind that has not yet traveled."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency when childhood memory tightens the prophecy's personal cost ("a child will grow with a pin in her breath"), forcing the renunciation that forecloses archiving. The "roots crack the rooftop" cost is legible on-page when refusal becomes the only path preserving "softer vowels."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "unwritten mercy" reweights archival duty via the folded parchment, avoiding moralizing. Final blessing "describing weather, not fate" resonates as non-literal answer to the central question, though "accidental prophecy" concept slightly over-explains early ("most dangerous kind").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rainwater that remembers the roofs it crossed") and rhythmic control shine in the prophecy sequence where syntax compresses under stress ("Do not swear the vow you cannot keep"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in the basin's child-voice response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "verbs that rustle like moths" and "blush and pallor carried by air." Minor overwriting in "frostbitten Greek" risks register drift but avoids muddle. Final line's "mercy can keep ripening" delivers propulsion without figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival duty and ecological prophecy transforms tropes: the orchard's "bruised quince" becomes a stake-bearing micro-setting. Bold risk in making the wax cylinder's destruction the resolution ("fold the parchment... unarchived") heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
