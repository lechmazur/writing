<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rebellion had grown into its own discipline") and embodied emotion ("skin oils... began to react") drive the final conceptual renunciation. Micro-choice of declining correction reveals hierarchy of values with cost in the citrus peel memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands unmistakably: "home is a rate constant" reweights the premise with conceptual cost ("chambers inside our breath"). Accumulative lens holds; dust-to-reaction density shift forecloses ritual path via earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fly amber functions as micro-setting that charges closure: pressed against the pane, it becomes "a fossil alphabet spelling yes," constraining the protagonist's final action and making home's redefinition tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as dust accumulates into "chalky guidance," then "skin oils... began to react," narrowing options to conceptual surrender. Visible cost in the dissolution of physical home into "chambers inside our breath" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chemical metaphors ("valence," "rate constant") without moralizing. Final image—"dust and rain agreeing to hold our secrets"—resonantly answers the central question by reweighting "homecoming" as process, not place.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("compounds of memory," "bronze quiet") modulates under pressure: basin ritual uses clipped clauses ("Skin oils... began to react") for acceleration. Zero POV leakage; scientific lexicon stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each line multiplies meaning ("amber caught the drop and jarred a tiny current of sunlight loose"). Final line achieves textural specificity without muddle: "kindness of dust... holding secrets" crystallizes conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes pilgrimage trope with chemical kinetics ("rate constant") for fresh emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes: the amber's transformation from "trapped wing" to "lodestar" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
