<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("warm coldness," steel arms cradling empathy) acts in scene during renaming ritual; final choice to bind harm to repair earns endurance with visible cost in "warm coat of frost" breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: renamed men moving with "work begins to move them" crystallizes options under accumulative lens, with conceptual cost legible in "warm coat of frost" and past loosening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Plaza actively constrains choices (bottle caps read on stepping stone) and charges closure: "shattered sky" evolves from "sentence" to "ceiling" then releases as "past loosen inside me" with ash motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: plaza tightening when arsonists arrive narrows options to difficult naming; cost is undeniable in "breath... warm coat of frost" as men begin unglamorous labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ending offers resonant answer via "Sila" (bridge/pause) and renamed roles; reweights opening's "shattered sky" without moralizing, embracing complexity through "not absolution, not forgetting" labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ash drifted in slow halos," steel tingling) modulates rhythm from halting to flowing under pressure; zero head-hopping despite multi-character scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "brazier hidden inside armor" crystallizes theme through concrete image; minor register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" offset by immediate sensory grounding ("footprints drift like low fog").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" transforms forgiveness trope through non-erasure renaming; risk-taking heightens stakes via "difficult naming" that binds harm to repair without safety-hedging.</comment>
