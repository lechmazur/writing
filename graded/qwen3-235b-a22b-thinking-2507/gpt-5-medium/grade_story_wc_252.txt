<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grace I hide in my muscles" and naming tension, but crowd's silence lacks embodied contradiction; flaw touches climax where stakes peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost in "ropes unknotted like old grudges" and crowd's windless cheer; Accumulative lens holds through whale-song escalation to crystallized naming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dock worker's hands holding "ropes, crates, and the occasional future" charge the final image; scrimshaw's whalebone constrains choice when held aloft, though eelgrass detail lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency when detaching mooring lines "like meanings," but "after violence becomes impossible" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "kissing knife she no longer needed" reconfiguration; avoids moralizing but "freedom in embracing true nature" risks slight abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bruise remembering a fist," "salt buckets and backs of knees") creates rhythmic control; no head-hopping despite crowd presence, compression taught early through lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold but "chain singing as it learns it was never a chain" risks mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat; final image's "seawater drying in our hair" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate lore as redirection ("new blade was a song that cut chains into ribbons") transforms tropes; risk-taking in "calamities archived by charms" deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
