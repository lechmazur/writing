<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (bureau duty vs. memory preservation) act simultaneously in scene; final choice to gather people earned by mentor's lesson and embodied in "precisely humane" stone-naming ritual with career-risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options (expunge vs. communal remembrance) with visible cost (disobeying bureau) when former residents carry stories away; Hybrid lens holds but drought exposition slightly dilutes causal pressure before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reservoir constrains choices (mud-printed foundations dictate walking path) and charges final image ("ridgeway and lake reflect each other"); "mirrored hush" evolves from sensory detail to thematic anchor though drought description occasionally overpowers action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve memory vs. bureaucratic erasure) tightens when photographs reveal "map of debts," forcing warden's agency; cost legible via bureau order violation, though secondary pressure from frogs/loons slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sapphire label's transformation from curiosity to communal touchstone; final image ("people carry it away in their mouths as something living") reweights inundation without moralizing, rejecting clean erasure for living memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("foundations print the mud like patient bones"); rhythmic control under pressure ("photographs draw him toward the intersection... memory there behaves like undertow"); one filter-verb stack ("he feels the ridgeway...") barely dents consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("street names glint on rusted corners"); "lacquered by time" slightly clichéd but offset by "freckles with droplets" specificity; drought paragraph's figurative density risks muddle without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms drowned-town trope via sapphire label's precise hue and "map of debts" photographs; risk-taking (lyric accumulation over confrontation) heightens stakes as community braids "separate versions into one careful rope of meaning" without gimmickry.</comment>
