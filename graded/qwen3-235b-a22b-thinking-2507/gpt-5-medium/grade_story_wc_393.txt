<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chaplain’s embodied motivation ("listening for lives") and Jonah’s off-page presence through letters create authentic secondary pressure; minor deduction for Jonah’s characterization leaning slightly on telling rather than showing his resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost in Jonah’s "nodded without asking for mercy" and the ticking heart’s "beat inside the beat"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through sensory reweighting at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clockwork heart functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (thorn removal) and charges final image; prison booth lacks equivalent specificity, slightly diluting closure’s environmental resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening (heart repair) forecloses Jonah’s apology-without-action path; cost legible in his silent acceptance of rhythm over mercy, driven by chaplain’s agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clockwork mechanics ("rhythm to live it") avoiding moralizing; final line reweights apology as "map of steps" with earned ambiguity, though "guilt is gravity" skirts thematic echo without crossing into sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures shine (chaplain’s "listening for lives" vs. proprietor’s tactile precision); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density; minor deduction for verbatim repetition of "vibrant hush" creating subtle scaffold in a tight frame, preventing 9.0+ despite exceptional clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through clockwork specificity and "light through storm clouds" motif; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
