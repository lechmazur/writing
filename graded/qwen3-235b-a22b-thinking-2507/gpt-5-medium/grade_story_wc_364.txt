<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction under stress; Iven's resolve dominates without visible fear, though memory trade (parents/dog) shows embodied cost. Bruised wrist and traded memories anchor stakes, but micro-choices during storm lack nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is potent Earned Stasis: arches settle "a handspan," rubble sighs into stackable shapes with cost in Iven's bruised wrist and sacrificed memories. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through three-night ritual, though rubble's "sigh" lacks explicit physical consequence beyond Iven's toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard planet's floating arches actively constrain choices—roots weave ladders, mine shafts become "arteries." Magician's silk functions as micro-setting, its tightening dictating bargain validity. Final bells ringing "in a key of azure defiance" charges the setting with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is Accumulative mastery: each night's ritual intensifies density until Night 3's storm. Cost is unmistakable—Iven trades childhood memories and suffers a bruised wrist. Agency drives every beat; "bartered awakenings" reweights stakes through concrete trades rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "bartered awakenings" manifest as literal memory trades. Final bells reconfigure "azure defiance" as communal resilience without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "long hour between understanding and confusion" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("azure defiance," silk "glowed like water sliced thin") with rhythmic control—short sentences during storm ("Everyone ran... but Iven walked"). Minor register drift in "bartered awakenings" phrasing, but compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; lines multitask ("mending hinges so doors could choose to open again" conveys hope + occupation). Figurative language sparse but potent ("wind with grit and blue fire"). Final line avoids overwriting while charging prior motifs ("awake and deliberate").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bargaining with nature" trope via specific mechanics (honest-oath silk, memory trades). "Azure defiance" reframes resilience as collective patience. Emotional truth in trading childhood memories elevates beyond familiar humble-hero archetype.</comment>
