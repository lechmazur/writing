<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fiercely meditative" carver needing ribbon's poem marks to "loosen grip on certainty." Father's silent grief at lettuce beds embodies "contradictory impulses" without therapy-speak. Final kite-curve choice earns endurance of collective grief with visible cost in "ash gold evening."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "finished the daughter's stone by setting her kite in a single spare curve" crystallizes migration imagery into undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds—butterfly patterns and poem exchanges tighten pressure relentlessly. Storm scene proves "grief itself held the panes" with visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: condensation affects carving, cracked roof guides butterfly landings, seedlings demand measured tides. Final image of "ash gold evening" charged by soil that "glowed faintly, as if floor remembered sunlight." Micro-setting (ribbon) evolves from tool to emotional conduit with father.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"discover shape of collective grief without breaking it"—tightens through mother's spectral pressure ("gust steering from too much ornament") and migration deadline. Father's poem selection forces "shallow then deeper" carving that mirrors his emotional control. Cost is legible in "breath that did not shatter itself" amid thundering calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "grief migrates in widening rings" shown via butterflies, not stated. Final kite curve reweights opening "thundering calm" into earned wisdom. Zero thematic echo—mother's "roots refuse bricks" lesson becomes embodied in carving process, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: carver notices "glass ribs singing like tide," measures "breath between letters." Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("wind threads fern shadows") to clipped ("chisel followed the seam") under pressure. Mother's presence filtered through "hush that teaches"—no head-hopping, only embodied focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dirt path glowed faintly, as if floor remembered sunlight the way skin remembers touch" shows multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language sparse but potent ("butterflies tested the cracked roof"). Storm scene avoids purple prose: "nothing inside broke, as if grief itself held the panes." Final line’s "ash gold" crystallizes tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carving + butterfly migration as parallel grief processes. Transformation test passed—changing to "tombstone maker" breaks living/death interplay. Risk-taking in making mother’s mentorship a "gust" feels inevitable. "Movement is shape of collective grief" reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
