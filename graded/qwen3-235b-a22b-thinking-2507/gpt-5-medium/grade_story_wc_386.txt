<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied details ("silt moves as if remembering," "frost-burned hands") and micro-choices like warming the globe between breath and lamplight. Sofia’s symbolic weight slightly overshadows her individuality, but the protagonist’s contradiction—truth-weaver who "could have shouted"—earns the climax’s restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the foreman’s "lowered eyes" and Sofia’s husband turning the "stuck" crank crystallize the conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—the tapping rhythm’s density intensifies until the globe’s clicks match logs, narrowing options with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier ice shrine actively constrains choices: portholes enable "windows of connection," while working in "borrowed starlight" forces ritualized precision. The snow globe’s physicality—"melted" state, "rusted crank"—charges the final image, reweighting truth as fragile yet enduring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the globe’s clicks "match their maintenance logs," forcing the foreman’s surrender. Protagonist’s agency shines in methodical escalation—inviting dreamers to "listen together" transforms evidence into communal truth, with cost visible in the harbor’s "flickering" rhythm and the company’s retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "weaving truth carefully" becomes the metered hymn that exposes corruption, avoiding moralizing. The final image—snow globe "shin[ing] in borrowed starlight"—resonates as non-literal answer: truth salvaged through quiet persistence, not victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"sky brightens like an eyelid," "silt moves as if remembering"—with rhythm mirroring the tapping motif. Voice modulates under pressure: short, visceral phrases during the dive ("cabin gape like pulled teeth") contrast with lyrical restraint at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels narrative ("melted snow globe" → "melted snow globe shine"). Figurative language serves pressure: "rivet that failed was a rehearsed scapegoat" compresses causality without muddle. "Milky bruise" description epitomizes textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost whisperer" trope through rhythmic evidence-gathering—Sofia’s taps as "lifeboat for evidence." Fresh inflection: corruption exposed via music-box clicks, not testimony. Avoids safety-middle with morally ambiguous resolution: "exposure is a gentle blade" prioritizes healing over vengeance.</comment>
