<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: rejecting false comfort yet creating labor-intensive hope. Micro-choice of placing lanterns where market stood reveals hierarchy of values with cost (solitude for integrity). Sailor interaction slightly underdevelops status dynamics but single-POV baseline excels with alchemist-specific perception ("ground kelp into ink"). Final renunciation of wish-based existence earned by prior refusal of easy bargains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "felt a faint ticking... no one needed wishes anymore" crystallizes the paradigm shift with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each small act (writing invitations, ringing bell) tightens the dominant stake. Orientation clear by 40 words; cost proof irrefutable in the final image reweighting the bottle's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (can't pour from it, so people pour into it) and charges the closure image with ticking. Paper-lantern cove pressures tactics: tide carries shell invitations, lanterns become tools. Final image ("broomstrokes, handshakes") recharges setting details with earned specificity—no generic postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wish-based existence vs. labor-built trust) signaled by paragraph 2 and deepened through accumulation of small choices. Escalation driven entirely by Iria's agency: solo work → sailor arrival → communal sweeping. Cost unmistakable in "poorly punctuated world" becoming "market arguments," with final line confirming paradigm shift ("no one needed wishes anymore").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: revival as "rehearsal that never ends," charter as "recipe and song." Final image of bottle-ticking offers non-literal answer to "how to rebuild civilization" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—sailor articulates "something that asks instead of answers," but subtext lives in kelp ink and broomstrokes. Complexity embraced: wishes aren't evil, but reliance on them forecloses growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alchemist's concrete focus ("pried dates from timbers," "stack nets like drying rack") modulates rhythm under pressure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally—close during problem-sorting, expansive during revival planning. Dialogue natural with subtext ("debt to the city"); sailor's lexicon ("polished by storms") distinct from Iria's. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in embodied cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "wrote a charter that began as a recipe and ended as a song" does triple duty (action/theme/voice). Sentence variety accelerates with scene needs—short bursts for lantern-placing, lyrical cadence for revival planning. Final line "felt a faint ticking" crystallizes Accumulative lens without figurative muddle. Every word advances story, character, or atmosphere; no overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost town revival" trope through specific alchemist lens: civilization rebuilt via "habits of how hands meet," not magic. Fresh inflection in amber bottle's irreplaceable logic (no opening → collective pouring). Risk-taking heightens stakes: entire closure hinges on imagined bottle-ticking. Avoids abstraction with verifiable details (bell "polished by storms," kelp ink). No derivative elements—fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
