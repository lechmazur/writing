<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I am all of them, but only until the tide turns" and the librarian’s acceptance of contradictions as methodology; embodied emotion via "kelp coat dries into paper" concretizes identity flux without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via "remembering is just wonder doing chores" and the creel’s waiting promise; cost is the librarian’s eternal vigilance ("as long as tides turn pages") under Accumulative/Textural lens where pattern intensification reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bamboo creel functions as micro-setting: it constrains choices (gathering loose words), charges closure (rinsing to "sweeten the words"), and embodies the theme through tactile, evolving use across three beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening: the woman’s crisis crystallizes the librarian’s abstract duty into concrete action (pouring words onto bells), narrowing options to "accepting contradictions" with visible cost—the librarian’s perpetual labor against forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the creel’s labor: "remembering is just wonder doing chores" reweights preservation as sacred routine without moralizing; the final image ("bread on the sill") offers resonant hope grounded in prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "salt-flecked panes," "barnacles chant Dewey numbers," and "minnows of thought" filter reality through the librarian’s gear-adjacent consciousness; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("She breathes, and the kelp coat dries into paper").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("titles, they are shores; they tell the minutes who to become") propels meaning. Near-miss: "chlorophyll on the floor like a signature" slightly strains metaphor but pays off in closure’s thematic charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "librarian" trope through tidal mechanics and gear-heart; "migrating identities" gains freshness via kelp-coat physics and the creel’s fin/anchor duality. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring cost.</comment>
