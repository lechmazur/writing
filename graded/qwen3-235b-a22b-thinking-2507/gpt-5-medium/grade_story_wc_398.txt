<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (love vs. self-trust) embodied in the map tremor and admission "cannot to the second"; final choice to write new terms earned through vine grafting metaphor with visible cost of unspoken truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options via folded map/scar image; conceptual cost legible in "she nods to the first and cannot to the second" under Accumulative lens where density tightens through letter/map motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Burned letter edge and pruning knife function as micro-setting that constrains choices (writing new terms) and charges final image ("scar folded into a future"); sensory details filtered through vineyard expertise ("air tastes of apple skins").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (reconciling love with self-trust) tightens texturally via map transformation; cost undeniable in trembling map and inability to speak truth, though escalation relies solely on Accumulative deepening without secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (pruning knife/map-writing), not moralizing; final "verdicts loosen" reweights "destined mismatches" with resonant ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo despite traveler's "gift" comment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trellis creaks as if remembering a slower century") and rhythmic compression under stress ("Not doomed, I answer..."); dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquism, voice modulates from hushed opening to passionate subtlety.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; every line does triple duty (e.g., "shoes borrowed courage from gravel" establishes setting/character/emotion); final "verdicts loosen" recharges opening "valley hushes" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "destined mismatches" through vine grafting metaphor; cartographer/vineyard tension avoids generality, with risk-taking lyric structure heightening stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
