<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("turn back only if called" vs. obligation) and embodied emotion ("crack like a knuckle confessing") compel the climax. Final choice to step into the glare earns visible cost through mother's ledger and city's hunger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: stepping into the glare reconfigures watchers as "measures, not mercies" with bruising pressure. Accumulative lens holds via pattern density (five-six-five rhythm) tightening options to one irreversible path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle shells constrain choices (crack underfoot, limpet seams) and charge the final image ("turtles keep their vast time"). Reed whistle's notes function as micro-setting, altering tactics at each pressure point with salt-scars specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's pattern-reading agency: ledger interpretation forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in "pressure that bruises" and the mother's thinned-into-silence fate, though hunger's stakes could tighten earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("step into the corridor of glare") reweights "What do you see?" into a non-literal answer about measurement vs. mercy. Theme emerges through ledger's lattice and tide knots, avoiding moralizing while charging the cost of questioning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barnacle constellations," "pulse of shell") modulates under stress with rhythmic compression ("crack blossoms into hollow"). Voice remains cartographer-specific without head-hopping, even during watcher confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunwashed dread" to "light keeps ringing like a bell" recharges motifs with propulsion. Peak beats ("pressure that bruises") avoid figurative muddle while heightening tension through precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for lost parent" through turtle-shell city logic and watchers as non-merciful measurers. Emotional truth in "quietly driven" compulsion avoids abstraction; the ledger's grammar of crossing feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
