<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "discoverer vs person" tension; embodied cost in "trapped freedom tightening when struggling" avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of ledger/jar earned by prior micro-choices, though chimera twin remains underexplored as active character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "one hand letting go of the ledger while the other planted the empty jar" crystallizes identity trade-off. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with "as memories alter" refrains tightening pressure toward the garden's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned ship setting actively constrains choices: carousel horses guide movement, fog prevents docking, salt-furred prizes evoke lost history. Emerald card's green reflections mapping constellations directly charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: emerald card tests transform from observation to soil-pouring action. Cost becomes undeniable when "chimera twin discoverer self unclasped," sacrificing identity for the garden's "silence of a name unsaid" with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("poured the soil," "breathed until solace woke") rather than abstraction. Final image—"compass that pointed toward whoever I would become"—resonantly answers "trapped freedom" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fog muffled carousel bells," "ferris wheel leaned like a compass needle." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("stitching footsteps through narrative threads"), with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruise-colored circle of hush" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" (Q5 comment) avoided, but "recaptured only the silence" slightly overwrites a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival ship decay with identity quest avoids trope clichés. "Unkindled solace" as cold soil—not metaphor but tangible object—transforms abstract theme into charged specificity, making the garden's "trembling names" inevitable.</comment>
