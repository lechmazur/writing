<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("hunger for meaning" vs fear of collapse) manifest physically through the vial; final choice to return earns endurance via UV revelation's embodied cost during bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: scent-density escalation culminates in Charged Poise closure where "tears answer like rain returning" reconfigures grief's cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting actively constrains choices (UV light required, humidity affects scent release); "crystal shadows" evolve into "patient ink" charging the final image of disciplined bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through scent progression: curiosity → vial-triggered collapse → bloom-induced reconfiguration; cost legible in physical collapse and single tear collected for the archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ambershade's vapor ("shadows inside brightness"), not statement; final "work finally named" reweights grief as soil-nourishing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "smells stir uninvited storms"; syntax modulates from lyrical ("crystal shadows cut the aisles") to fragmented ("My eyes sting with a phantom") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "feathered vapor climbs, not cloying sweetness but a tone like rain on crystal" achieves triple-duty propulsion; minor deduction for "disciplined lightning" metaphor tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via extinct botany lens; "sachets of grief" and pollen-as-memory create fresh emotional calculus where scent actively shapes present shores.</comment>
