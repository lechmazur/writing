<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in crisis; courage realization leans toward tidy resolution despite strong embodied ache ("kneel and the ridge hums with stories I did not live"). Micro-choices under pressure (not reaching yet) show promise but flaws don't compound meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "what takes my hand is warmer than fear" crystallizes cost through conceptual repricing. Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks one meaningful deepening—pressure grows through texture alone without narrowing options until the final reach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Palm/star micro-setting constrains choice (final reach) and charges closure ("fits where the star was pressed"). Yet the bay setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than actively shaping tactics—sand clicks like clocks but never impedes movement or alters decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage) tightens through deepening ("ridge asks for patience"), but pressure feels externally imposed by guides rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is legible ("warmer than fear"), yet the single deepening lacks the visible price shift required for 8.8+ under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: courage as "shimmer keeping pace" reweights "unused courage" without moralizing. Final image ("skiff nest inside my chest") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "courage never disappears" edges toward abstraction that slightly dulls earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide slackens like a sigh") and rhythmic control under pressure shine, but elevated diction ("gently persistent") occasionally clashes with POV lexicon during crisis. No head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early via "vigil in twilight" repetitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("vigil in twilight" verbatim repetition) dulls momentum. Otherwise high density with clear propulsion, but "water is thin and silver" slightly strains physical logic without pattern payoff, triggering a -0.3 artifact deduction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courage as tactile "shimmer" avoids stock metaphors. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, though "leash" trope risks derivativeness—saved by specific bay imagery and earned emotional truth in the final reach gesture.</comment>
