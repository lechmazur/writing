<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels via scientific lens ("preprocesses reality," dust-pattern analysis), but internal conflict between past "flamboyant fireworks" approach and current humility remains summarized, not embodied in micro-choices under pressure; Mara's flaw (bias for explosions) lacks visible struggle during sweeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal" reweights disaster response with conceptual cost (abandoning drama for patience), but the felt cost remains abstract; Accumulative lens holds through dust/star pattern parallels without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices: broken panes frame clouds "like equations," compost barrels supply "earthy arithmetic," and butterfly dust charges the final image; micro-setting (dust slide) directly shapes Mara's calibration project and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (stripping drama from disaster) are coherent, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure point; neighbors' arrival offers communal warmth but no narrowed options or tactical shift, missing the visible price escalation required for 8.8+ under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust/star parallels without moralizing; "kindled humility" avoids sentimentality by rooting in concrete actions (tracing spirals, pinning plastic sheet), though "recovery is not a rescue" slightly edges toward thematic echo in notebook entry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pulsar glitches" framing silt patterns) and rhythmic control shine; sentence cadence mirrors scientific precision ("Each stroke gathered a faint brown whisper"), with lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's dust resettling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose density excels but minor synonym loops ("residue tell its layered chronicle"/"long sentence the storm had written") and repeated "dust patterns" phrasing slightly dilute momentum; no closure-threatening artifacts, yet prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and greenhouse recovery feels inevitable; transforming "butterfly wing dust" into calibrated light-filtering topography demonstrates risk-taking that heightens both stakes and emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
