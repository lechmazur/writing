<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I was not delaying, I was listening to time" amid partner's perceived abandonment. Embodied emotion thrives through tidal metaphors ("foam tightened by wind") without therapy-speak. Only minor deduction for partner's silence lacking one more micro-action beyond the smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "grotto silting shut" foresight crystallizes in "carry the grotto in my pockets." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—"year inland/year coastline" deepening reweights stakes. Orientation flawless from "ancient grotto under stars" anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Grotto actively constrains choice: "dripped like slow metronome" pressures decision time, while "sea glass light" refracts the pivotal "sidelong seeing." Jade cicada (micro-setting) charges closure when "tucked between notebook and heart," evolving from mentor's gift to "stubborn glint" of trust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: "listening to time" transforms the pause into "shared migration." Cost is visceral—"notes smearing, grotto silting shut"—and reshapes tactics (carrying coast inland). "Year inland/year coastline" sequence deepens under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "shell remembers the seam" becomes "press ourselves gently," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("carry the grotto in my pockets") resonantly answers the central question. No thematic echo; "star fed hinges" stays earned through mentor's backstory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defines voice: "catalog reefs, warmly observant" shapes every observation. Rhythm mirrors tidepools—short clauses ("Larval stillness, sudden split") then flowing sentences. "Texture of time" abstraction instantly grounded by "foam tightened by wind" sensory detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "barnacles while your words hovered beyond saying" multi-tasks setting/conflict/character. Only hairline slip: "saline plausibility" slightly abstract but rescued by "gull feather soft" immediacy. Final line "arch had formed... finally passable" crystallizes closure with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "career vs love" trope through marine biology lens—tidal-pool chronicler isn't gimmick but defines conflict processing. Risk-taking in all-internal pause pays off via accumulated sensory weight. "Star fed hinges" feels earned, not derivative, through grotto setting.</comment>
