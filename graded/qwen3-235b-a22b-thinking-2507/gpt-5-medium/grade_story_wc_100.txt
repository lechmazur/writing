<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "inadvertently stubborn" choices under pressure; embodied emotion in "names feel waterlogged" avoids therapy-speak. Final promise of permanent addresses earns closure through prior causality, though micro-choices lack visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when lanterns answer "as permission," reconfiguring SOS to SOR with conceptual cost. Orientation perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds consistently. Minor lens ambiguity mid-story prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choices (slipping between bubbles) and charges final image with "patient registry." Shelves leaning "like old divers" and thin water embody urgency without static description. Micro-setting (lens shards) shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving rest addresses) tightens meaningfully when mantled thing tests the dome. Protagonist's agency in aligning shards despite warning creates visible cost. Escalation driven by accumulated pressure under Accumulative lens, though antagonist lacks sufficient causal progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: revitalizing lens transforms distress signals into "SOR." Final image of library keeping "lights" reweights rest as location without moralizing. "Distress that asks, Where shall we rest" crystallizes the non-literal answer organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("measures days by weight of names") filters all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in staccato distress signal description. No head-hopping; elision of descent taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "water is thin as breath" achieves high density. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" metaphor risks overwriting but doesn't obscure closure. Final line's "kelp tea and candles" demonstrates strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater library transforms funeral tropes through specific details (books on tethers, shelf-numbered streets). "SOR" signal is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
