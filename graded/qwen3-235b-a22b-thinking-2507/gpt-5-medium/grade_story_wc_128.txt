<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's "cautious exuberance" manifests physically in thrumming/steadying beats, and her cargo-broker specificity (demurrage waivers, manifest-combing) grounds motivation. Jun lacks contradictory impulses—his "whimsically attentive" trait never backfires under pressure, limiting interiority depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the ledger-key exchange, crystallizing "cycles of compassion" through shared custody. But Hideo's identity resolution ("by midnight they find him") lacks earned friction—no visible cost during the search weakens the Accumulative lens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The locket functions as micro-setting: its "worn brass blinking like a moon" evolves from envelope discovery to emblem charging the final image. Harbor tools (rope bookmarks, pilings) constrain choices—Mara drafts ledgers "near her office" where dockhands "moved crates," proving environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recognition vs. secrecy) tightens through Mara's micro-choices: taking the mistaken envelope, initiating the Harbor Ledger. But pressure lacks escalation—no moment where exposure risk forces a trade-off; the "cautious exuberance" promise never crystallizes into a narrowing choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "cargo also sings when lifted properly" reweights labor, while gulls falling quiet as people sign offers non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing—wisdom arises from Mara forgiving "demurrage for a choir," not abstract claims.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's cargo-broker lexicon ("stevedores," "demurrage") creates distinct perceptual signature, but Jun's dialogue ("pages breathe calmer when trumpets are sleeping") slips into generic lyricism. Voice convergence in emotional peaks weakens character distinction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in paragraph 3 ("waits," "smiles," "asks") creates filter-verb stack dulling immediacy. Overwritten moments like "cautious exuberance thrums in her; recognition can be risky" sacrifice clarity for lyric density in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "community recognition" trope through maritime specificity: "rope-splicers," harbor-ledger-as-music-score. But "mistaken envelope" device feels familiar; true originality lies in locket's dual role as object/emblem driving causal chain.</comment>
