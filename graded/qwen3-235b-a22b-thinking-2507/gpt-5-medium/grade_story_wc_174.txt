<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in halted drawing of the woman and "tools for theft" realization; embodied cost in shaky puppet-penned letters. Slight abstraction in "half-lit epiphanies" edges toward thematic echo but redeemed by concrete micro-choices like offering the stick without speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "no applause, only that meteor hush made of listening" crystallizes the ethical shift with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds through density build to the woman's entrance; argument's cause is implicit but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Radar dome's scaffolding actively constrains choice (measuring "body toward healing," strings as constellations). Vellum and story stick function as micro-settings charging closure: puppets' "shaky" writing on vellum embodies the earned transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening pivots on Sorin's promise to "write with the spoken present," narrowing options from extraction to collaboration. Woman's entrance forces irreversible stance crystallization; cost legible in abandoned applause and "breath brittle" vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: puppets cutting threads to write on vellum reweights "ethical storytelling" without moralizing. Final meteor hush offers resonant non-literal answer—listening as restitution—avoiding thematic echo despite "explore ethical storytelling" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Calligrapher's perceptual signature ("vellum glimmering like moon-drifted puddle") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control in climax ("sentences curved like fish moving upstream") avoids lyric drift; single POV stability anchors the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; dense imagery ("smoke that forgot its fire") serves atmosphere without muddle. Minor density in reflective blocks stays under BRR limits, but "half-lit epiphanies" repetition risks thematic echo—saved by earned payoff in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppetry ethics through tactile details (story stick as "prosthetic conscience"). Avoids template by grounding moral shift in specific tools: reversing strings reconfigures power without sermonizing, transforming seedy-bar satire tropes.</comment>
