<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I want the same" amid teaching starlight navigation, with chain link embodying embodied constraint. But students lack differentiation beyond "most become quiet," weakening relationship crucible under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through "horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall," with conceptual cost in redefining stars as pressure. Alien return feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chain link functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("chain that holds us") and constrains night crawls. Benthic pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactically constraining, missing 9+ gate for final tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating without stars) tightens through edge geometry practice to alien encounter. Protagonist agency weakens at climax—the aliens drive resolution, missing visible price payment for 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "edges remember the lights" and pressure-based stars without moralizing. Final line offers non-literal answer to navigation question, though "stars are pressures" flirts with thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "sonar scrolls" and "tide stamp" imagery. Rhythmic control falters slightly with "patient lantern fish" diction clash, but elision of alien communication is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts; "salt-pitted chain heavy as small moon" exemplifies density. Minor scaffold in repetitive "I tell them" phrasing prevents 9.5+, but propulsion remains flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms alien tropes through tactile navigation physics. "Pressure as stars" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with benthic constraints creating emotional specificity that avoids generic marvel.</comment>
