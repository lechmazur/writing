<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid ("grip reality loosely like wet paper") but lacks concrete contradiction under pressure; motivation clear yet passive witnessing avoids hard choices, missing visible cost in pivotal flood scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "silence tethers me" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("judgments loosen like old laces"), but flood resolution leans on swan's guidance rather than earned protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge actively constrains choices (retreat during floods enables book-mending), charging final image; "mildew surrenders its hunger" exemplifies setting-as-action with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (witnessing neutrality) signaled early, but flood escalation resolves via swan's instruction rather than keeper's agency; cost ("loosening judgments") feels conceptual without tangible tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mushrooms rearranging alphabet" rather than moralizing, but "I call every whisper a tide" risks thematic echo; final image reweights witnessing as renewal without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("roots argue with ladders"), rhythm modulates under pressure; minor density issue in final paragraph where "regenerative silence" repetition dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"River unwrote its anger" violates physical logic (mixed metaphor), muddling closure beat; otherwise stellar specificity ("mildew surrenders its hunger") with zero scaffold in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Origami swan transforms navigation trope into irreplaceable logic; "silence as compost" synthesizes archival work with ecological renewal for fresh, inevitable insight without gimmickry.</comment>
