<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tool-based perception ("learn by touch"), but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; the apprentice's "steadily curious" trait enables ledger-keeping yet never conflicts with fear or doubt under pressure, missing 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly when historians find the mural—cost is legible in their tears and laughter—but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) persists past midpoint, narrowly avoiding the -0.3 penalty; "ribbon festival" tape image crystallizes reconfigured stakes without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Measuring tape functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (kid's route, mural walk) and charges the final image; rain-beaded skylight pressures all action (drenched clients, "coins washing" sounds), but cryptocurrency timeframe lacks tactile integration beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("map cultural patterns that survive floods of belief") tighten through the phone-screen and mural scenes, with visible cost in payment shifts (recipes for coins), but "reverse engineering" method isn't tested under rising pressure—escalation relies on accumulated examples rather than protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally from "ribbon festival" tape image reweighting prior measuring acts, avoiding moralizing; "cultural patterns that survive floods" insight is earned through phone-screen cracks and mural discovery, though "inherited mystery... to be carried" risks abstraction without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("rain stitched the glass," "knuckled backpack"), but "cryptocurrency crashes" jargon breaks voice consistency; rain/confide motif modulates tone effectively, though cartomancer's dialogue lacks distinct idiom versus apprentice's narration during high-stakes scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spidered shatter points" and "alley smelling like wet cardboard and basil" exemplify textural specificity; every sentence advances multiple elements without figurative muddle, even in dense scenes like the tape walk to the mural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms cartomancy into urban cartography via measuring tools, but "reverse engineering" premise edges toward tech jargon; specificity of "chipped mugs pinning butcher paper" and "faded wristbands" creates authenticity, though one fresh inflection (tape as emotional tool) falls short of 9+ risk distinction.</comment>
