<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in reeds "unsure whether to sing or remain rooted," but the guard's late appearance lacks prior causality for his tears; micro-choices like breath synchronization reveal values under pressure yet feel slightly choreographed rather than emergent from flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation fails past 120 words ("we gather" without POV anchor), capping score; closure achieves Charged Poise as boundaries dissolve with visible cost (fear lingering, guard's tears), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) risks undermining escalation legitimacy despite resonant final hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choice (breathing test bends stone, ice crossing), charging the final image, but white-room syndrome weakens spatial choreography; "mineral, ink, snow" sensory details lack consistent POV filtering, diluting environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("fear lingers") signaled early but never concretely tested; escalation via breath synchronization deepens pressure, yet the guard's emotional shift lacks causal escalation—tears feel coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, muting cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "paraphrase" action reweighting the decree ("Keep afraid, lest meaning live"), avoiding moralizing; final image of "breath writes looping script" offers non-literal resolution, though secondary "dissolving boundaries" motif risks overstatement without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "lantern-moth hush" and "quartz colonnade" hums, with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; elision of backstory ("winter the ban began") taught early and paid off via window-tape peeling, though collective "we" POV slightly blurs focalization consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stunning texture ("snow pressed into pages," "tears commas of brine") but mixed metaphor in "thrumming like throats remembering unspoken oaths" followed by "tunes itself to pulse" creates coherence drift; template cadence ("They say... They paraphrase... They teach") dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of political metaphor through sensory-bound "dissolving boundaries" (ice cracking, fogged glass), avoiding abstraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, yet "cloud-shadow poet" archetype edges toward trope without sufficient lived-in specificity to fully transcend.</comment>
