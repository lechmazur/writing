<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices like tracing parade routes reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; "walking without leaving anywhere" embodies contradictory impulses. Final renunciation of monuments for practice earns closure, though the woman's interiority lacks the archivist's depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated." Accumulative lens holds throughout, with density increase in the valve ritual crystallizing options under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The trumpet valve constrains choice (turning ports to create sound) and charges the final image ("metronome of remembering"). Harbor's rain-mist evolution directly alters tactics, with masts as staff lines mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when valve ritual forecloses passive waiting for parades; cost is the emotional weight of "navigated absences." Agency in choosing practice over performance drives escalation under Accumulative lens, though exile's urgency could press harder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "metronome of remembering" reweights exile's meaning without moralizing. Final image answers "how to return?" via practice, avoiding false equivalence while embracing memory's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "salt takes shape in a handprint" and gulls punctuating cloud-staff lines. Rhythmic control mirrors "staggered intervals," with compression under pressure ("rain turns from memory into mist") enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tide carries moonlight" crystallizes theme without telling. Minor register drift in "hearten the harbor" redeemed by concrete action. Final line achieves high density: "steady and exact" charges prior motifs with earned cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through harbor-as-ledger metaphor. "Navigated absences" synthesizes memory mechanics into fresh emotional truth. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring the resonant final image.</comment>
