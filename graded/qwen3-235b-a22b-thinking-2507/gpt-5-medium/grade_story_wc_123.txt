<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "credibly curious" motivation versus restraint, embodied through micro-choices like decoy charts. Flaw: antagonist lacks depth beyond functional pressure, limiting relationship crucible despite single-POV allowance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("integrity is a barometer too") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure deepens via sensory density, but the single lateral move slightly limits escalation complexity for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: courtyard's fig tree enables escape, fountain's metronome click corrects posture, pebbles court breeze. Final image recharges "layered tranquility" with cost, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. rogue control) tightens through protagonist's weather expertise, foreclosing direct confrontation. Cost is visible in decoys and pigeon's flight, but escalation lacks secondary pressure for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through weather-as-truth metaphor without moralizing; "storms tell truths where institutions edit them" earns resonance. Final barometer image reweights integrity as conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barometric tremors braided with rumor") modulates under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext ("You are not being hunted..."), but minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" moments prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "pressure fell not forward, but sideways" crystallizing Accumulative escalation. Closure beat ("pigeon became a dot... pressure rising toward rain") achieves textural perfection without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and surveillance state avoids tropes; "rogue quarantine" reimagined through weather logic. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but emotional complexity slightly edges toward 8.9.</comment>
