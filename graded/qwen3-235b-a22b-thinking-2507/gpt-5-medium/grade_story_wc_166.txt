<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "exile vs vocation" is embodied through dance metaphors ("spontaneously anchored"), but cartographer's motivation remains abstract; "shoulder trembling like a string" shows visceral emotion without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("law cannot seize what is only visible between two people"), but the causal arc from exile to vocation lacks a tightening beat; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as atmospheric pressure chamber, but "basin's moon" fails to constrain choices; body-as-setting shines when the shoulder becomes "a sky" and "instrument," charging the final image with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs state-enforced amnesia) tightens through the verse's creation, with visible cost in "exile tilt into vocation"; escalation is lyrical but lacks protagonist-driven pressure shift beyond observational method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the moonstone verse as embodied resistance ("harbor of a shoulder"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "nostalgia ban" into "garden listening when stars grow tired" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct "tide dancer" lexicon ("adagios," "clandestine barometer of longing") permeates voice; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("wind moved the leaves like black water"), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "obsidian grace" metaphor sustains density without muddle, though "cosmic verse on mortal skin" verges on overwritten abstraction in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes dance/cartography into fresh resistance metaphor; "verse on skin" transforms exile trope through specific embodied stakes, avoiding generic lyricism with "moonstone cabochon dust speck" precision.</comment>
