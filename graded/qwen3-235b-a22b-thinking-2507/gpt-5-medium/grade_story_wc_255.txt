<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ivo's colorblind pursuit of visual beauty, but Mira remains functional; "innocently cunning" trait lacks visible struggle compounding choices despite strong embodied motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("imperfect song finds him") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but non-closure accumulation cap applied for vague timeframe and static phoenix motif diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reed tongue constrains choice (trading brush) and charges the final image ("sings with chips and waves"), while furnace heat and plant arrangements shape tactics with sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation as Ivo trades brush for reed, but "courage weighed by touch" remains abstract without concrete test against the dominant beauty-in-imperfection stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (wavering glass, singing spaces) without moralizing, though "his job is to listen open" borders on thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reads furnace smoke by flavor") and rhythmic control under pressure; plant language teaches the pattern early, paid off in closure with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("thin as a promise sharpened by breath"), but "whispers colors he knows by story" slightly violates colorblind POV consistency in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory trade-offs (color for rhythm), though "bartered awakenings" concept risks familiarity without deeper transformation of the core premise.</comment>
