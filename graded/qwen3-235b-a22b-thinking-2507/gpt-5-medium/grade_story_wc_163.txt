<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "belonging without pretending to be native" is embodied through map-to-companion shift; Rin’s role lacks sufficient friction to test the core motivation under pressure despite credible micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("tasted like consent" reconfiguring sunrise), but the sentinel algorithm’s "breathing on time" requirement lacks early setup, slightly weakening causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater city actively constrains choices (rip tides deadline, corroded ports), yet "shadowseam wonder" leans abstract; the burnt feather’s carbon memory concretely charges the final image as irreplaceable tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation via shared exhale deepens the dominant stake (rhythm of belonging) with visible cost—tide clocks "cupped in ribs" reweights tactics as the city shifts from threat to consent, driven entirely by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "maps as companions" without moralizing, but "luminous respite" borders on thematic echo; final image’s "breathing I hear the old city answer yes" avoids platitude yet lacks conceptual repricing’s sharper cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("midnight shivered the surface into ink"), with syntax mirroring tidal rhythms; no head-hopping, and "burnt feather as quill" lexicon stays rooted in the astrologer’s professional bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver fish hung like drowsy stars" achieves textural density without muddle, though "shadowseam wonder" risks abstraction—rescued by "half-light edges" grounding the phrase in sensory action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes underwater city trope with landscape astrology into fresh emotional calculus; "rhythm of belonging" avoids cliché through specific cost (mapmaker becoming listener), though "lighthouse fire" backstory feels slightly derivative.</comment>
