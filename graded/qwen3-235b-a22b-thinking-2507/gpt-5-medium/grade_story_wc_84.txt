<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via technical lexicon ("soldered from broken sextant") but pilgrim's "cities that welcome only the finished" backstory lacks embodied stakes. "Perpetually surprised" trait manifests physically in trembling hand yet remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "belonging is not found but tuned" crystallizes accumulation with felt cost in "spaces between letters agree to hold you." Accumulative lens holds from first glyph to final directive without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory's brass gears and fissured stones actively constrain choices (pulling rope, drone navigation). The matrix chip functions as micro-setting, charging closure when it "brightens" to reveal silence as letter—environment shapes tactics relentlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when blanks become "rests" not errors—a single deepening driven by pilot's algorithm adjustment. Conceptual cost ("vowels of home" as breath) is unmistakable in the pilgrim's tongue-stored thunder and "patient appetite" of absences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through action: "missing pieces" evolve from map cracks to algorithmic rests, culminating in non-literal answer "spaces between letters agree to hold you." Zero moralizing—final image reweights belonging as active tuning, not destination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drone pilot's technical voice ("movable type," "bearing from wind") contrasts pilgrim's lyrical fragments ("storing thunder"). Perceptual signature thrives in "cracked tiles as punctuation," though "conceptual repricing" phrasing slightly breaches POV lexicon near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" motif risks overuse but redeems via "dusk becomes thinner" evolution. Minor scaffold in "perpetually surprised" repetitions, yet propulsion remains relentless—"drones pull bearings from the wind" compresses three functions into one crystalline phrase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms drone tech into poetic instrument: matrix chip translating sky to movable type feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (silence as letter) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure's "write our way out" crystallizes the synthesis.</comment>
