<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt/endurance) drive the library agreement; "bargained innocence" concept crystallizes flawlessly in "lighter than guilt, heavier than air" closure moment with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "forest firefighter" anchor arrives at 78 words, just past 120-word threshold; Charged Poise closure lands with felt cost in box's weight shift but penalty applies per test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Porcelain box constrains every choice (held "like fragile second heartbeat") and charges final image; ridge path's "new grass would thread" actively pressures the mother's arrival timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (translating pain) deepens via joint paper-repairing micro-choice; "rewove a missing hand" action narrows options toward library agreement with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("teach meaning inside harm by reflecting deeply") reweights "bargained innocence" without moralizing; "calibrating steps to heavens" offers non-literal answer to pain-transcendence question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots whispering on grit," "sky-songs"); "voice a cracked cup" modulates under pressure. One filter verb ("tried to enlighten") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-overwriting in "breathed their thin, ash-scented breath" barely avoids density penalty; zero loops but "hard softness" risks cliché until redeemed by concrete use in final step calibration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope via paper-children artifact; "bargained innocence" concept synthesizes emotional truth with fresh moral calculus on traded youth for town's breath.</comment>
