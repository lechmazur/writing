<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in hiding while seeking strength through vulnerability; embodied emotion in "kneeling to align ears with panels" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to speak names earns closure via prior causality, but micro-choices lack sufficient visible cost escalation beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "spared collision" crystallizes the cost of solitude-as-connection under accumulative lens. Lens clarity established by "flourishing stillness" motif at midpoint; power failure beat reweights stakes with conceptual cost ("transparency" enabling station's kinship).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass constrains choices during power failure and charges the final image ("small sun" kinship). Micro-setting specificity—copper smell, cold glass arcs—drives tactics while avoiding white-room syndrome; environment is active participant, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) tightens through meteor storm/power failure, with agency as attention ("polish marks into guidance"). Cost is legible in "cracked heart answer," but escalation lacks a tangible price beyond emotional shift, capping near high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "spared collision" reweights vulnerability as strength without moralizing. Final image answers the central question by transforming solitude into kinship, avoiding sentimentality via "salted face with ice" specificity and earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in janitorial POV ("fingerprints held tired hopes like fossil pollen"); rhythmic control peaks during power failure with compressed diction ("dead engineers stepped nearer"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from melancholy to quiet triumph without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "primal elegance of maintenance" strains coherence; otherwise zero loops with high density ("honeyed light draped gauges like shawls"). Final line achieves propulsion without muddle, but one elevated phrase prevents 9.0+ under tightened penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "cosmic janitor" trope through specific emotional calculus (maintenance as meaning-making). Fresh inflection in meteors honoring "old boundary" feels earned, but avoids risk-taking beyond lyrical depth; specificity anchors universals without gimmickry.</comment>
