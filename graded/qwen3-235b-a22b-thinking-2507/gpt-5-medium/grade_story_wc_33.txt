<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when mailman delivers unsigned letter ("do not ask for proof")—embodied rebellion via micro-choice with visible cost ("heart ungoverned"). Mina’s wisdom avoids therapy-speak by rooting insight in concrete action ("cracks the lid"). Slight abstraction in "foster futures" prevents 9.7+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "lighter for knowing where to go" crystallizes the "linking absences" method with undeniable conceptual cost (the jar’s sealed weight vs. "brittle hush"). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to the storm’s revelation where "faces I have never met" reconfigure promise currency. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bottle constrains every choice: "arm hairs rise as if saluting thunder" physically pressures delivery, and its sealing directly charges the final image ("room brightens"). Creek’s battery casings and coal-lit doorway provide tactile constraints that shape Mina’s wire-bird ritual. Micro-setting as environment fully qualifies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing broken promises) tightens through the bottle’s visceral danger ("vibrates the lid") and social risk (wrongly routed letter). Mailman’s agency drives escalation: choosing to stay with Mina and deliver without proof. Cost is legible in "boots prudent, heart ungoverned"—a visible tradeoff between duty and emotional truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "broken promises are our currency" shown via taped notes and traded envelopes, not stated. Ending’s non-literal answer ("linking absences") reweights the jar’s storm as cataloging absence—not fixing brokenness. Mina’s wisdom avoids moralizing by arising from the mirror’s fogged revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: mailman’s trade shapes observations ("maps hold their breath," "promises whisper as coins"). Syntax modulates with pressure—short phrases during bottle tension ("Every step vibrates"), lyrical flow at twilight. Zero POV slippage; "respectfully rebellious" refrain evolves contextually from warning to identity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "the air folds into a brittle hush" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language serves character: "dipped lights, tiny shadows stitching contraband" filters smuggling through courier’s lens. Final line’s rhythm ("one route more") recharges "linking absences" without muddle. One borderline metaphor ("saluting thunder") prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms courier trope via "linking absences" method—fresh inflection where healing means connecting voids, not mending brokenness. Every detail serves premise: drone border’s hum becomes part of the "brittle hush," battery casings inform creek’s penny-taste. Avoids safety middle by making the boy’s silent posture change the climax.</comment>
