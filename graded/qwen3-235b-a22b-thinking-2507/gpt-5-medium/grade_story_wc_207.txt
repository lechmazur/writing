<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "failure is the only map" and grief's "hinged awakening" that "clicks but does not close." Embodied emotion ("sound scrapes rust off memory") avoids therapy-speak, but motivation to "find where explanations fail" leans abstract despite father-revelation payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: grief that "clicks but does not close" crystallizes in the sitting-by-lagoon moment. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density ("water like black with inquiry"), though factory backstory reflection slightly drifts from present-frame micro-choices near midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon constrains every choice—navigating by smell, boardwalk hinge failure—and charges the final image when rain-memory releases the ledge. "Resonant hush" motif evolves from setting detail to embodied cost ("water hushes me into failing properly"), meeting 9+ gate with environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: unscrewing jars releases scents that open paths, culminating in scarf discovery. Cost ("grief that clicks but does not close") is legible, but factory shutdown timeframe's pressure feels underexploited—more could leverage the "decades" of drowned hush for visceral urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image—father teaching knots—resonantly answers "where explanations fail" without moralizing. Theme emerges through hinged awakenings (grief, scarf, lagoon) reweighted by "courage," avoiding abstraction. Scarf's discovery as earned wisdom ("some awakenings hinge on love") exemplifies organic thematic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petrichor collector," "morsel of last summer's cloud") controls rhythm under grief-pressure: short clauses during psychometry ("boots vanishing... laughing man") contrast lyrical calm later. Zero POV drift; "resonant hush" motif modulates tone through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids scaffold with high density ("lamp coughing itself out"), but minor synonym churn in grief description ("opens on corroded pins... clicks but does not close") risks thematic echo. Final lines ("walk home lighter, hinged awake") achieve crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "hinged awakenings" mechanic—scarf discovery reconfigures knots as courage, not closure. Emotional specificity ("laughing through clenched teeth") avoids generality; factory ruins as "apology someone finally means" synthesizes setting/theme with fresh, non-obvious precision.</comment>
