<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I swore at theories... but patterns did," with embodied emotion ("breath tasted of iron"). Final renunciation—forgiving the wheel but not people—earns cost through prior causality of valve turning and father's truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "carried the memory of the weight, not as proof, but as a tool" crystallizes the shift from seeking truth to wielding it. Accumulative lens holds as pattern-tracking tightens to the valve turn, reconfiguring the ghost myth's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The valve wheel constrains choices (appraising weight, turning it) and charges the final image ("set it back to open"). Sensory details like "droplets quivered like verdicts" filter through the explorer's tactile focus, avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: mapping radio timestamps leads to valve turning, narrowing options to confronting the truth. Cost is unmistakable—"weight arrived in my arms... from the stubborn metal of intention"—reweighting the dominant stake of swallowed truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Normal means are heavy; they sit in the muscle" avoids moralizing. The final image ("town would keep hearing its factory ghost shift... I would keep hearing the metronome") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to truth's weight without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lamp made a yellow coin," "breath tasted of iron") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("Cold dripped... in slow beads") to clipped tension ("I turned the wheel slow") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "Beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary, and grease made the beads shine." Figurative language remains precise in peak beats (e.g., "droplets quivered like verdicts"), with no muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through specific, grounded choices: valve wheel as truth-object, "factory ghost shift" as town myth vs. personal reckoning. Emotional specificity in "I did not forgive the caller... I forgave the wheel" avoids generic templates.</comment>
