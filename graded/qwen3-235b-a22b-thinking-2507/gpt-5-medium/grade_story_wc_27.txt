<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action: "knees gave, not in fear but in release" embodies contradiction without labels. Micro-choices like closing the circuit with skin reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight overwriting in "hummed the way grief hums" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "knees gave... as if someone finally returned a name she had been loaning" crystallizes emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening to "thunderous serenity" reconfiguration. Siren chirp as "permission" edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: deckplate vibrations guide her to stones, rust constellations become navigational data. Vintage opera glasses transform from "absurd" prop to "proof of alignment," charging the final image. "Orbital equations" slightly generic but anchored by character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's deepening engagement: listening to deckplates → circuit-closing with stones → demanding coordinates. Cost legible in "risk waking whoever silenced them" and rebellion's transformed purpose. Stones' communication mechanism borders on convenient despite early setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "translate need into navigation" crystallizes without moralizing. Final line reweights "thunderous serenity" from oppressive quiet to active hope, avoiding thematic echo. Resonance built from "dew on wire" specificity, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "chipped frame," "fissure a comet," siren "like a bird deciding not to speak." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from lyrical to urgent. "Orbital equations" slightly jars voice but not enough to break consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lights blinking awake like cautious eyes" shows textural specificity. Minor dual simile ("patient as the tide... floor remembered") but distinct concepts. Closure beat pristine: "rhythm stayed in her bones like a compass" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes through specificity: non-combatant protagonist ("hunted echoes") redefines revolution as orientation. Risk of making pause the climax pays off via "thunderous serenity" becoming active hope. No safety-hedging; vulnerability heightens stakes.</comment>
