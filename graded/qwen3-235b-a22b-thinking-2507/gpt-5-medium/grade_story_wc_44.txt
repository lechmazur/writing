<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("paper hears secrets first") and "quietly deliberate" trait manifests in mirror arrangement, but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal loop-closing. Final renunciation of impatience earns cost, yet emotional progression remains slightly abstract without visceral embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "noon is an agreement" crystallizes with undeniable cost when the gold line "slips under skin." Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through image density ("multiplying doorway of uncast shadows"), though "spoons bend reality" setup lacks full payoff in closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mirrors as "throat," automaton key) constrains choices and charges final image ("gold line across mirrors"). Observatory’s perpetual night directly pressures the shadow quest, but "kitchens below" remain ornamental, missing opportunity to integrate spoon motif with core stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening understanding: "disciplined question" narrows options, "multiplying doorway" intensifies pressure. Scholar’s agency drives every turn ("whispered the rune," "traced a line"), with conceptual cost legible in the contract’s visceral integration. One tightening suffices masterfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "loops" and "sealed awakenings," culminating in resonant CR: shadows "wait inside decisions." Final image reweights the central question without moralizing, though "alphabet of loss" risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete signing action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink behaves like weather") shines, with rhythm modulating from measured ("collimators asleep like cattle") to urgent ("clicked against decision"). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly undermines POV consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters with paraphrase loop: "Every movement repeated, then repeated again." "Spoons remembered old tremors" / "spoons remembered their lesson" creates subtle synonym churn. Otherwise exquisite propulsion, but artifacts prevent 8.8+ eligibility despite strong closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow mythology via "loops" and "sealed awakenings" feels inevitable. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off, though "budding rune scholar" trope lacks sufficient transformation. Emotional truth in "refusing to be impatient" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
