<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure reveal layered values: idling motor to "kiss the stairs" and reading letters silently with the engineer showcase embodied contradiction (truth-seeking vs. serene acceptance). Final renunciation of roaring earned through prior causality ("my mind had learned to move by training instincts"). Single-POV constraints limit relationship depth but interiority remains flawlessly concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "serenely I stood in upheaval" crystallizes the protagonist's refusal of revenge, made legible by the physical settling of truth ("weight of truth settle where it needed to settle"). Causal lens holds through salvaged letters forcing stance crystallization. Persistent constraint (engineer's ledger) shapes the final meeting's tactics and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial constrains choice and charges closure: its compass guides navigation early, then "holds still" as witness to truth's weight during departure. Canal setting pressures tactics via chain retrieval and floodgate angles. "Slime-green seal" and "weak blue of dawn" avoid cliché through tactile specificity, though "twilight" description edges toward ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: salvaging the box narrows options to confrontation with the engineer, with cost legible in the "hindsight clarity" tide that lifts but doesn't resolve. Dominant stake (truth architecture) tightens when letters match childhood memories ("no child had ever learned to skip stones"), altering tactics toward the meeting. Cost is felt in the engineer's "face that had seen several versions of the same dawn".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "architecture of lies" becomes physical via vellum maps and ledger payments, culminating in the final image of "ripples like new lines on a map" that reweights the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—engineer's "river demanded bending" frames complexity without false equivalence. Closure offers resonant non-literal answer through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in stress-filtered details: "lantern glass polished by rain until all edges appeared honest" reveals the narrator's truth-obsession. Rhythmic control peaks during salvage ("rope tightened; the hook had found metal") with intentional fragments. Zero head-hopping; compression ("pried the lid under weak blue of dawn") taught early pays off in closure's taut lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion rarely falters: "grating complaint rose through the water like a story finally asked to speak" merges action and metaphor without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in "serenely radical correction" (elevated diction) but redeemed by concrete payoff. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary to match pressure (e.g., "I pushed from the steps into soft current" vs. earlier complex clauses).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality through synthesis: "architecture of lies" trope transformed by canal-specific details (floodgate angles, ledger payments) and the fresh inflection of "serene upheaval" as active endurance. Emotional truth anchors universals—"my father had worked the locks" grounds the city's deception in familial betrayal. Risks unconventional closure (quiet departure) without gimmickry, heightening stakes through restraint.</comment>
