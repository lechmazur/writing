<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "skepticism stitched into every step" versus "breath trembled," but Mara’s shift from disbelief to whispering a name lacks one micro-choice showing active surrender of control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns deepen meaning across beats, with "skepticism drained away in measured drops" crystallizing Earned Stasis; cost legible in Mara’s "bleak relief" as she accepts her grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor’s mineral veins and frost patterns constrain choices—prism amplifies light only through pillars, while window frost forces tactile communion; final image recharges "shifted hush" as luminous acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when frost reveals Mara’s handprint, narrowing options to belief or denial; cost is visceral in "mouth formed the name she swore she would not say," though escalation relies slightly on atmospheric pressure over active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "objects witness" refrain without moralizing; final line reweights "truthful lies" as earned wisdom, avoiding abstraction by rooting insight in Mara’s thawing breath and car window.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "refractions moved like shy fish" and "breath making banners"; rhythmic control peaks when frost "resembled faces from fractured arcs," compressing tension without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost softened, revealing a slow mandala" achieves high density with propulsion. Near-miss: "truthful lies" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate tactile payoff in palm-warming glass.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism via quartz physics and car-window frost; emotional specificity in "helpless hour outside a clinic" transforms trope into indelible human truth without quirky ornament.</comment>
