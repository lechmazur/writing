<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps," embodying grief’s futility. Minor deduction for "damp astonishment" bordering on label-only feeling without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the cost is welcome if I can read its texture" crystallizes acceptance with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of reconfigured meaning in the final bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living bridge garden actively constrains choice (e.g., "bridges carry me toward a pavilion"), charging the final image. Micro-setting of the halo fragment’s taste ("iron, sap, hush of rain") shapes the narrator’s pivotal acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: pressing the shard multiplies distances, forcing confrontation with grief. Cost is unmistakable when the narrator "cannot snatch the past without tearing it," narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "grief into singing" reweights to "quaking reverie that holds still," avoiding moralizing. Final image resonates as a non-literal answer to time’s texture without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in tactile specificity ("ink sweating like dew," "lichen threaded with rain"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("lungs holding the pale roar") modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("paths elongate into whispers and the whispers tighten into stairs"). Figurative language serves propulsion without muddle, even in peak beats like the library fire disintegration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms maze trope through hyperbolic geometry and retrocognition into grief’s texture. "Quaking reverie" risks abstraction but gains freshness via embodied stakes (e.g., "rough as weathered bark and smooth as breath").</comment>
