<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as guide fails to foresee music's choice; embodied cost in trembling pearl refusal. Baker's dough-scented breath revealing character-specific motivation without summary. Flawless micro-choices under pressure like the guide's aborted hand movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation: cave tones evolve from rain-steady to polyrhythms to cradle beat. Charged Poise closure lands when pearl swallows sigh, shaking chalk from "forgotten names" with visible cost in guide's shattered certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal ribs constraining pathways via breath-pressure directly charge the final image. Sensory specificity ("scale that tastes of salt") filters through baker's occupation; environment evolves causally as chords burst into polyrhythms. Final cloak image charged by setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when pearl refuses guide, narrowing options to surrender. Escalation driven by baker's agency (whispering dough sounds) under Accumulative lens. Unmistakable cost: guide's certainty emptied by chord, crystallized in "I did not see it coming" repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: loaves proofing as metronomes, market gossip in pearl's hum. Final image reweights "everyday magic" without moralizing; baker's laugh embodies why the cave exists. Zero thematic echo despite prompt-like title phrase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: guide notices "pathways only patient ears can inhabit." Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during polyrhythms. Minor deduction for "bright darkness" repetition diluting final image's uniqueness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts but "bright darkness" repetition creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beat. Figurative density ("unseen forces spread like warmed butter") remains legible. Final line's "woven dusk" avoids cliché through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms pilgrim trope via baker's yeast-craving; mundane magic reframed as "humble spell of morning routines." Specificity like "bubbles clicking like tiny metronomes" creates freshness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
