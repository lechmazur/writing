<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "small stone star" and margin-walking; micro-choices like sleeve smudge reveal values. Oracle's "fault-tolerant" trait lacks depth in pivotal confession moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost in "tension leaves shoulders" during snow-scale confession. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory density escalation to "compass of auroral sorrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Botanical illustration constrains choices (breath-holding exercise) and charges closure as "map." Weather station itself feels slightly generic despite strong "anemometer lee" micro-setting detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency through naming truth "at the edge," with unmistakable cost in physical release. "Swaying certainties" deepens stakes via stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gentian's evolving weight metaphor; final image reweights "auroral sorrow" as compass without moralizing. "Truth becomes lighter when shared" resonates as earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "teal color of rain charts" and compression ("rib of galvanized rooms"). Rhythmic control intensifies under stress with zero head-hopping; elision taught early via fever break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "soot line crosses, a hinge" cadence. One borderline figurative stack ("small stone star") prevents 9.0, but zero closure artifacts preserve momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via "fault-tolerant oracle" frame; emotional specificity in "mass could absolve meaning" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking heightens stakes through weather-instrument metaphor coherence.</comment>
