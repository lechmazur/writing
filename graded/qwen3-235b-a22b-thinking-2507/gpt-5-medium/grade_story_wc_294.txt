<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "polished calm" as evasion tool vs. fence-like patience anchors choices, but coders vanish without emotional consequence; final insight ("circle is where hunted/hunter trade names") lacks prior causal struggle to feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost ("sun felt borrowed," tire rut discovery), but accumulative lens weakens under pressure—investor withdrawal lacks tangible escalation beats, creating two distinct non-closure issues (-1.5 cap).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train environment charges closure via tiger car rut discovery; "bright lions peeled" and "paper money crackled" constrain choices and reweight the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths circle) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—investor pullout occurs off-page with "soft apologies," missing visible price that alters tactics per band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ribbons tied, bright, persuasive, and useless" reprise, but final conceptual cost ("trading names") feels undernourished; resonant non-literal answer nearly achieved without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("smelled like rain and passwords," "tongue was a ticket stub") sustains rhythmic control, though "patience of fences" briefly drifts into authorial lexicon during high-stakes shutdown.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("taped bills above bunks" conveys action/emotion/theme), but "unlearn their names" risks abstraction in pressure beat; final image ("borrowed sun") narrowly avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms startup trope through circus train specificity ("map changed color at dusk"), yet "paths circle" premise lacks bold risk—emotional truth in "ticket stub" tongue saves from middle-ground hedging.</comment>
