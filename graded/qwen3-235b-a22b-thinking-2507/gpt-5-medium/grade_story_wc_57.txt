<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "patience is not passivity" made concrete through micro-choices like humming to ease the knot. Embodied emotion in "dock ticking like a clock beneath the snow" avoids labels. Final endurance earns trust with visible cost (dawn return), though "infinitely patient" label risks abstraction without the physical proof of seed sheen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: fisherman's dawn return crystallizes stakes with tangible cost in "seeds bundled" and "rope rewrapped." Accumulative lens holds through knot-decoding deepening, with "hidden splice" yielding carrot-seed method narrowing options. Cost proof undeniable in "dormant skins take on a sheen" showing labor's physical result.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow isn't backdrop but constraint—memory's "color I could weigh" enables knot-reading in low light. Rope's micro-setting (wool/hemp/nylon textures) directly charges closure by altering tactics. Fulgurite glass transforms from tool to trust symbol, making environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge before "unraveled in salt") tightens when hidden splice resists, escalating pressure through protagonist's agency ("hummed low"). Cost is visceral in "breathing through fulgurite" and dawn's physical toll. Accumulative escalation reweights stakes perfectly as each knot reveals survival wisdom with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "frayed end kept counsel" embodies "mercy and yield" without moralizing. Final image ("harbor keeping us") reweights "secret weavers" as living practice, not myth, with conceptual cost in "dawn" return. Avoids binaries through drought/watering tension, offering resonant answer to preservation dilemma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "seed husks settle into loam" filters observation through collector's lens. Rhythm varies under pressure ("Something yielded; not fiber, but time" compresses diction). Patterned elision (weavers' wordless communication) taught early and paid off in rope's "slow grammar," with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog thickened, wrapping lamp and mast and me" demonstrates varied rhythm. High density: "clove hitch held drought beaten by night watering" does triple duty. Closure beat ("harbor keeping us") avoids figurative muddle, with "warm rope" charging final action. No artifacts dull the earned stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope through specific mechanisms (knot decoding, fulgurite conduit). Emotional truth in "patience is not passivity" made concrete via seed test. Risk-taking in making rope the archive feels inevitable, with "oceanic hush" modulating tension without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis elevates stakes.</comment>
