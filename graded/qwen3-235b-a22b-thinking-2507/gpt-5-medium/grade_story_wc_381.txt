<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; motivation clear but archetypal. Embodied emotion ("sleeves damp") strong, yet flaws lack compounding stakes. Final endurance feels earned but lacks visceral cost escalation beyond atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "the future exhaled and tried again" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds via density increase in "code untied like wet shoelaces," though escalation lacks causal agency. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (mapping silence via currents) and charges closure ("water bead like a planet"). Sensory hierarchy excels ("alder leaves," "mason-jar fireflies"), though "terrestrially cosmic" occasionally drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing "iron noon") tightens through the code's stubborn fear, narrowing options to breath-guided stillness. Cost is legible in "stubborn kind of memory," but escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water’s "grammar without grievance" and final "room for futures," avoiding moralizing. "Listening keeps the world from hardening" risks thematic echo but lands as earned subtext via concrete action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paper thunder," "velvet riverbed") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor abstraction in "tranquil blaze of listening" slightly dilutes POV coherence, but lyrical compression remains purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density occasionally blurs clarity ("terrestrially cosmic shimmer stitched across shadow"), yet propulsion holds. No closure-dulling loops, though "wet shoelaces" metaphor risks mixed vehicle. Final image ("water after stone is lifted") crystallizes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual with ecological prophecy; "mapping silence" transforms trope through tactile specificity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, though some phrases ("cosmic patience") edge toward familiar lyricism without full transformation.</comment>
