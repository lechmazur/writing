<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority excels in embodied observation ("hand resting on rail," "pulse grazed") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet static—no evolution beyond initial patience-driven quest, weakening final renunciation’s earned weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully (echo’s "soft refusal" blooming into truth), with visceral cost in time debt ("bells counted a number that did not match the hour"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via cadence breaks deepening sensory density, though midpoint lens clarity slightly wobbles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canal system and pendant constrain every choice (water’s "hush, rush" dictating timing; pendant sculpting time), charging the final image. Micro-setting mastery: lichens/clouds inked to "guide returners" reweights the nursery’s fragility under closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (time debt for uncaging echoes) escalate through protagonist’s agency (borrowing sighs), narrowing options to repayment. Cost is visceral in bells and "nap tug," but escalation lacks one deeper trade-off—e.g., physical toll—to tighten tactics before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: echoes as "larvae" of unresolved tension reweights memory’s birth. Final image ("drawing truer than my eye") offers non-literal answer to "where echoes are born," avoiding moralizing, though secondary stake (artistic legacy) feels underwoven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows, stubborn ink"; "minnows schooling at pier") modulates rhythm under pressure. Lyric compression ("hush, rush, hush, rush") taught early pays off in closure’s cadence shift, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion shines ("water surged, then balked"), but "giant’s nap" metaphor risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold ("I do not stop time; I only convince it to lilt") slightly dulls closure’s immediacy, though density remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: time-borrowing as artistic process (not power fantasy) transforms "echoes" into biological larvae. Risk-taking heightens stakes (repaying debt to a sleeper), with specificity ("comma-shaped creatures") avoiding derivative tropes while charging closure.</comment>
