<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs purpose in pauses) manifest in concrete micro-choices like reading frost patterns; "pauses were doors" earns closure with visible cost of renouncing easy solutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("doors could be shut behind you"); Accumulative lens holds through frost-led revelation, though arson backstory edges toward excess reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Canyon actively pressures choices (wind as "instruction"), frost patterns constrain the key revelation beat, and mica-sand quarry charges the final image—exceeding 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist's agency (ledger → frost match → wind memory) narrows options to the annealed solution; cost legible in renouncing guild/destruction paths, though timeframe lacks urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through glassmaking ("pauses were doors"), with final image reweighting purpose without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glass hears better than it sees") modulates under stress; rhythmic control in "Song nested in stone..." beat teaches patterned elision paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("flaking its own moons onto my lap") with clear propulsion, though "charred like a black sun" edges toward mixed metaphor in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revenge trope through glassmaking specificity ("annealed" solution); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via frost translation mechanism.</comment>
