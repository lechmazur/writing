<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's "carefully reckless" flaw drives the salt ravine rupture and motivates the symphonic solution; embodied guilt ("heart fugueing") and micro-choices like faltering mid-composition show contradictory impulses. Lio's motivation remains underdeveloped despite his crucial return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "trust... a choreography of shoulders turning toward one another" crystallizes the cost of vulnerability with the lamplight as "promise kept." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation to the room's overtones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive functions as micro-setting where shelves have "throats" and wind answers paper placement; the glass ink well's "wavering glyphs" constrain choices early while the stele's "hush" charges the final image of collaborative revision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's agency tightens stakes through composing the suite—each movement's syntax and cadence narrows options toward Lio's return. Cost is visceral in "the stele's hush were releasing him" and the need to "confess doubts aloud" during revision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "interlock makes integrity audible" and the final "door held open by joined hands" reweight trust as choreography without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while charging the lamplight image with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic metaphors ("dust motes hung like annotations"); rhythmic control shifts from lyrical reflection to staccato tension during the salt ravine memory. Dialogue carries subtext through brittle delivery and purposeful indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion through verbs like "fugueing" and "unblurring." Figurative language serves stakes ("ink breathing into letters shaped like opened doors") without muddle, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic theory and emotional repair through "symphonies of truth"; transforms reconciliation tropes via extinct phonemes and stele mechanics. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
