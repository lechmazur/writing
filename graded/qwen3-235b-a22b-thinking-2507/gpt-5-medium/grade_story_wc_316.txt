<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("frost after the void," "sick morning scars") and contradictory impulses (numbness vs. thawing) culminating in earned joint custody decision. Micro-choices like role-switch test reveal values under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "frost inside me drain" delivers felt cost while "future felt vivified" crystallizes options. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup (static gusts, river memory) with no causality breaks; orientation anchors immediately via "floating rock dojo."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brain jar functions as micro-setting: its static affects teeth and river-stone taste constrains the climax. Final image charged by "breathed its answer through our teeth," making the object indispensable to closure's sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Neri/Rae's sparring—only their alternating current vivifies the mind. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the role-switch test, with numbness defeat providing unmistakable cost ("plug pulled" on emotional ice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "river where child would not step in, then did" crystallizes the circuit concept without moralizing. Final image reweights "complementary opposites" as vital circuitry, avoiding abstraction through "taste of river stones" as password.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static to our teeth," "sick morning scars") and rhythmic control shine during sparring. Compression ("history rewrites itself") is taught early; dialogue fragments reveal Neri's measured syllables versus Rae's tyrant-breaking laugh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("blades of attention slices through pretense") propels momentum. Minor figurative muddle ("slow rivers of breath") doesn't obscure closure's crystalline "future felt vivified" payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope through circuit logic: custody as alternating current feels inevitable. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, abstract closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by "river stones" specificity.</comment>
