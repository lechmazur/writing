<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns") and embodied emotion ("heart big as a boiler") ground the crawl space dweller’s motivation; micro-choices like etching the arrow reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the final cache ledger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (enduring invisibility) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but the tape’s "humming an index" lacks causal linkage to the notebook’s location, weakening escalation’s pressure coherence at the critical beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pipe chase and tape fragment function as micro-setting that constrains choices (unlatching panels, cache placement) and charges the final image ("etched a small arrow"), with sensory detail filtered through the dweller’s tactile expertise ("mothcolored murmurs," "cedar and iron").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as the outage lowers "the world enough that whispers could surface," but the tape’s agency in locating the notebook feels coincidental rather than driven by the dweller’s methodical choices, muddying escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("cache became a ledger of kindnesses") rather than abstraction; the final image of etching the arrow offers a resonant answer to "how visibility might be crafted from service" without moralizing, reweighting the premise through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sapphire hush," "tide pooling after night withdraws") and rhythmic control under pressure ("shuffling with pads of felt on knees") teach the lyric pattern early; elision of the dweller’s backstory remains anchored to present micro-choices like caching the button.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold ("drew a ferromagnetic tape reel fragment bound in copper thread" does triple duty), but the repeated phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" creates a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "sense memory" as tactile artifact rather than metaphor transforms the helper archetype; the crawl space dweller’s methodical service reframes visibility through constraint (ducts, grates), avoiding sentimental tropes while heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
