<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in micro-choices: whispering arguments, chip trade offering, and the ceasefire current through hands. "Hopeful desperation made me brave" risks label-speak but is redeemed by concrete action ("offered the liaison a trade"). Brother's scaffold observation crystallizes status dynamics under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "danced between allegiances that no longer felt like opposite shores" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("bought us only a season"). Orientation anchors immediately ("raft city where carnival never stopped"). Accumulative escalation holds via density increase (graffiti → raft realignment) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Raft city functions as active constraint, not backdrop: "pathways bent until VIP zone met fish market" literally reshapes conflict. Chip micro-setting charges closure ("touched the chip... ceasefire current"). Sensory details filter through Nessa's professional bias ("color grammar," "ballast hold") while avoiding symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentrification vs community) tightens through Nessa's agency: encoding messages → chip trade → proving self-regulation. Cost ("only a season") is legible and scales to length. Escalation driven by protagonist under Accumulative lens via density increase, though climax slightly over-tidies the liaison's conversion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "prosperity without memory was just new accounting of hunger" sets up final image reweighting dual allegiance. Avoids moralizing; closure ("danced between allegiances") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without stated moral. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "I think in loops and ledgers" informs compression ("tents breathed like lungs"). Rhythmic control under pressure via syntactic shortening ("Hopeful desperation made me brave"). Near-slip: "hopeful desperation" borders on label-speak but saved by immediate action ("offered trade").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("grime of beginnings, salt and oil and a scuff of my mother's laugh"). Only hairline flaw: "hopeful desperation" risks therapy-speak in peak beat, but redeemed within three lines by trade action. Final image ("steered toward future") avoids closure muddle with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gentrification reframed as "flow engineering" vs "survival with choreography." Chip mechanic transforms trope through specific raft physics. Risk-taking (lyric compression for pressure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "grammar grows" slightly over-articulates insight.</comment>
