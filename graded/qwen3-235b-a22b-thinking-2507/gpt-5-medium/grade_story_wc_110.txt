<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("coward, learning to be freed by honesty") manifests in micro-choices like pocketing then returning the lens; embodied emotion in "shiver" when hints "ache" avoids diagnostic labels. Final confession earns endurance with visible cost in "held it too long," though curator/troupe reconciliation slightly overshoots single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when projector rolls the water-promise scene amid "bright ripples," reconfiguring mistrust with conceptual cost of the registrar's exposed fear. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via doodle-pattern escalation, but "the square inhales" slightly overstates the cost’s physicality for this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chipped lens constrains choices (eavesdropping via puddles, screen setup) and charges the final image where "truth... sleeps in" through light. Rain-crystals actively pressure action (wet screen, bolt-refitting), avoiding static description; micro-setting drives closure’s tactile resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (mistrust vs transparency) tightens when registrar projects doodles publicly, narrowing options to confession. Cost is visceral in "held it too long," but escalation relies slightly on crowd’s instant acceptance rather than protagonist’s agency under Accumulative lens—minor friction in pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "ambiguously clear" truth emerges through doodles’ evolving meaning, not statement; final water-promise projection reweights the oath with conceptual cost of fragile trust. No moralizing—resonance stems from "tender" proof and "gentle" laughter, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (light/reflection-focused noticing) creates distinct texture: "puddles murmuring like glass throats," "drying tarps." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("heartbeat is a drum"), but "crystal whispering forecourt" slightly overwrites early tension. No POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("apologies condense on benches"), but "tender and ambiguously clear" echoes earlier phrasing, risking synonym loop. Final image’s clarity ("truth... sleeps in") avoids muddle, yet "crystal whispering" borders on mixed metaphor in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms community conflict through light-based communication ("doodles on concert tickets"), avoiding trope. Emotional specificity in "tear over sprocket teeth" feels fresh; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though rain-crystals verge on familiar lyricism.</comment>
