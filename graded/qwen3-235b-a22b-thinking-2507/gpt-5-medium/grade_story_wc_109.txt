<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Oracle’s contradictory impulses (obsession with silence vs. bleeding urgency) drive her map-making; courier’s shift from shivering skeptic to transformed carrier is earned by his embodied "space where fear had been" realization, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: bleeding fingers, flaking gold, and the star’s potential death crystallize the oracle’s "walking tide’s erasures" stance under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legible in "she will stay to finish the map."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fort’s wet stones directly constrain choices (bleeding grooves, sleeve-tearing) and charge closure; "gold leaf bruising like ripened fruit" evolves into "scratched map," making environment indispensable to the final image’s promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulated silences narrows options: courier’s admission about the scroll tightens stakes, and his thawing into "steadier breaths" carries felt cost as fear’s space becomes purpose, driven by oracle’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "book of almost-music" offers non-literal answer to "how night speaks," reweighting the "map of endless night" through concrete action (scratching stones), avoiding moralizing while embracing erasure’s complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("breath a gull does not take," "marbled hush") and rhythmic control in "star delays between shivers" teach the lyric pattern early; voice modulates perfectly from skepticism to shared calm without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gold smear... crack... shine" shows purposeful pattern variation; "storm-whitened lips" exemplifies textural specificity without muddle, even in high-pressure closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "oracle" trope through negative-space cartography; "map of how night moves through us" synthesizes erasure and endurance into fresh emotional truth, with risk-taking (quiet climax) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
