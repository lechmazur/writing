<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("survivor of erasure" yet "ocean coughed me back") drives every choice; embodied emotion in "fingertips taste bitter" avoids therapy-speak while showing trauma's physical residue; final silent return of the label earns endurance with visible cost in widow's trembling hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: placing the label crystallizes the widow's impossible choice (truth vs ledger) with felt cost in the clerk's retreat; Accumulative lens holds throughout as fragment-layering tightens to this reconfiguration; "world sifts through me" proves conceptual cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Container labyrinth actively constrains movement and enables eavesdropping (vent scene); the poison label—recurring micro-setting—charges closure as "small verdict" on the crate; oily constellations mirror internal state without overt symbolism while affecting nighttime navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming erased history) tightens when mechanic reveals widow's involvement, forcing crystallization at the stack; pressure accumulates through fragment-gathering until widow encounter forecloses reconciliation with visible cost in her fear and clerk's departure; agency lies in the narrator's silent choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from particulars: "certificate recorded attempt as success" embodies bureaucratic erasure; final label-as-verdict reweights history without moralizing; widow's "mourning colors faded into commerce" crystallizes capitalism's theft of truth through concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("eyes are sieves") dictates every observation; rhythm mirrors container stacks with clipped cadence ("clanks and low vowels"); mechanic's dialogue carries subtext through indirection; zero register drift even under peak stress ("taste of hospital light and gulls").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fingertips taste bitter" achieves triple duty (sensory, thematic, causal); final line recharges "cargo" motif with devastating precision; no figurative muddle in climax despite high-pressure beats ("world sifts through me" crystallizes stance).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic erasure through port-specific alchemy (stevedores, tides, container stacks); risk-taking in structure (no dialogue climax) heightens stakes; "oily constellations" and "rubber boots" reweight familiar tropes with visceral specificity that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
