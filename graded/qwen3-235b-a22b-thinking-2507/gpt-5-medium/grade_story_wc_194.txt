<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ending the dynasty by decree" versus newfound understanding; embodied emotion in throat tightening and unclenching door. Micro-choices like weighing the crank as a gavel reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Slight underdevelopment of initial shame motive prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "build bread ovens where its pillars once cast shade" reconfigures the dynasty's end with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to ash revelation. Minor escalation dip in ledger musings prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia room’s acoustics actively enable standing waves; ash tray constrains revelation method. "Golden shadows" evolves from tea-like pools to "lamp-lit commitments," charging the final image. Micro-setting (gramophone mechanics) shapes the entire climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (truth vs. inherited shame) tightens through deepening intuition, not reversals, fitting Accumulative lens. Protagonist’s agency in interpreting ash messages drives the cost: realizing the dynasty’s end was mercy, not failure. Cost crystallizes in "something inside me unclenched," unmistakable on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bread ovens" replacing thrones—no moralizing. Final image reweights "ending" as survival without abstraction. "Plague of power" metaphor avoids cliché via concrete stakes. Hairline slip: "eloquently silent" borders thematic echo but stays embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "sepia," "breathing brass," and ledger "marching ghosts" filter all observation. Rhythm modulates from ceremonial spin to "careful notes" in the city. Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction without voice drift ("wavering light I began to muse").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "needle descended onto a blank disc, nothing recorded, yet the horn exhaled" achieves triple duty. Figurative language ("rings grew like the age of a tree") enhances clarity. Only microscopic deduction: "marching ghosts" slightly generic but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden truth" trope via standing-wave mechanics and ash typography. "Plague of power" synthesizes political/familial stakes uniquely. Risk-taking (revelation through vibration) heightens coherence—removing ash mechanics would break closure. Freshness in "build bread ovens" as radical hope.</comment>
