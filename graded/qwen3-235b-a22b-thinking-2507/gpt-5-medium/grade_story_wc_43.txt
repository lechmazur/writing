<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (father's joy/loss, son's distance/return) act simultaneously in the shard scene; final choice to "carry the shard now" earns closure through embodied micro-choices like the son's "barely" sway.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when the son takes the shard bare-handed—"I will ask the world to be gentle"—with cost legible in the father’s breaths thinning to whispers amid the pulsing stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting objects (clementine peel, vinyl shard) constrain choices and charge the final image: the shard’s physicality drives reconciliation, while the "light pool on the blanket like a gentle river" reweights the water motif from illusion to transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by therapist’s agency: "hymning the mundane" deepens into shared history, narrowing options to this fragile moment; cost is felt in the son’s whispered "this time he stays" against the father’s fading breaths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image—"room holds the last note like a vow"—resonantly answers the central question (can brokenness be held gently?) by reweighting "pulsing stillness" from clinical observation to sacred cradle, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: therapist’s musical framing ("hymning the mundane," "chords that do not rush") modulates under pressure; rhythm shifts from measured ("window latch clicks") to fluid ("breathe together") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("peel," "sway," "loosen") with high density—e.g., "sunlight pools on his blanket so it looks like water he could swim" merges setting, metaphor, and character desire in one line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice tropes through musicality: "hymning the mundane" transforms dishwashing and bus tickets into sacred text, avoiding sentimentality while making emotional truth specific via clementine scent and vinyl shards.</comment>
