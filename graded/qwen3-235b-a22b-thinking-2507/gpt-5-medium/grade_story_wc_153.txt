<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied flaws: gripping shard reopens scar at dawn, "saving fear from hearing your ask" reveals self-sabotage. No therapy-speak; emotions layer via physicality like "fierce tenderness cracking my ribs." Mara's reflection as "shoulder paused near the door" shows micro-choice stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "I will share the hinge and let it breathe us" crystallizes refusal to decide with visible cost—the scar closing "a small white door learning how to stay open." Accumulative lens holds; pressure deepens via condensation messages fracturing into "near-answers," reweighting the hinge's meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gargoyle shard functions as micro-setting: constrains navigation (steering by unreadable condensation), charges closure via scar's transformation. Mangroves press choices as "gossiping elders," not backdrop. "Salt-sanded" shard and fogged lantern directly alter tactics, satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("moment before deciding") tightens through protagonist's agency: evoking spirits leads to condensation messages demanding "let your wanting be small enough." Cost is visceral—the scar reopening at dawn, then healing into a "small white door." Pressure accumulates relentlessly under Accumulative lens with no coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shards of concrete action: unsent letters become "proof of breath" when spoken aloud; the scar's wound transforms into a "door learning how to stay open." Final image reweights the hinge without moralizing—"let it breathe us" resonates as non-literal answer to hoarded tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: syntax fractures under stress ("Bring me that hour, I ask, fierce tenderness cracking my ribs"), flows during reflection. Purposeful compression ("Mara sent me here, without sending") teaches pattern early. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during water-memory scene without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via multi-tasking lines ("salt-sanded, torn from cathedral roof we sheltered under" compresses history, setting, emotion). Figurative language never muddles closure: "droplet words fracture into halo" precisely captures thematic shift. Rhythm varies—short imperatives ("Anchor the skiff") amid lyrical stretches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation tropes through specific, grounded choices: singing mangrove spirits, shard-as-compass, condensation messages. Emotional truth avoids templates via "tenderness hoarded" shame. Risk-taking (navigation by unreadable paths) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure image feels inevitable.</comment>
