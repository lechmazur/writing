<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guilt/hope) manifests in micro-choices like "garden the edges like speaking softly" and the final return with "better map of sunlight." Embodied emotion peaks when bread "cracks as if remembering heat"—no labels, pure sensory resonance. Final renunciation ("still refusing forgetting") earns cost through prior causality of normalized wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "lighter but not exonerated" crystallizes the cost of provisional absolution. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup (vanished bakery → litany of losses → crumb communion), with the "line thrown from shore" image reweighting stakes via conceptual cost. Orientation flawless within 20 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy and thorns actively constrain movement ("testing patience of heuristically gentle hands"), while crumbs/seeds evolve from ritual objects to closure-charging agents ("seeds crowding the seams"). Micro-setting specificity—bindweed path, cracked sill tucking crumbs—directly alters tactics and final image without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (tenuous absolution) tighten via the narrator’s escalating vulnerability: whispering names to the room → speaking litany of losses → sharing bread with the woman. Cost is unmistakable in "not exonerated," but escalation leans slightly passive; the room’s "unbending" feels coincidental rather than agency-driven under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: crumbs become "constellations," seeds "invite present to linger." Final line ("no miracle, only careful company") reframes the entire premise with earned wisdom, avoiding moralizing while charging the "sacred in ordinary" through particulate ritual. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle") infuses every observation. Dialogue carries subtext ("asked if I have been keeping watch") with distinct idiom (woman’s "oven cracked" revelation). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("breathe when wind exhales") to sparse ("We lock nothing") under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; each line multi-tasks ("leaves open like fists relaxing" conveys tea steeping, emotional release, and thematic weight). Final image’s crystalline clarity ("seeds crowding the seams") avoids figurative muddle. Propulsion never stalls despite high density—prose breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms urban erasure tropes via specific, lived detail: "sesame and ash" scent, landlord raising rent "week after son was born." Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—the "tenuous" absolution concept feels inevitable through crumbs-as-constellations, resisting sentimental resolution.</comment>
