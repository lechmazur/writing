<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through actions like mallet-tapping fruit, but lacks contradictory impulses in peak pressure; Zaya interaction shows micro-choices yet no visible flaw-driven struggle undermines the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "deck tilted but steadied" amid the knives-net hazard; Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density accumulation ("dubbed layers of sea") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard driftwood circle constrains choices (crates/oars for wind routing), but open seas setting remains generic; mallet-as-micro-setting charges final image though environment itself doesn't fully shape the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening through tower-of-beats sequence earns cost via knives-net adaptation, yet storm escalation feels slightly frictionless—prophet's competence lacks meaningful struggle against gale's force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action ("walls made noise, noise became map") with final "greener note" as resonant CR; avoids moralizing but obstacle-transformation premise risks pat resolution without deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "clouds dragged their hems low and hoarse"; rhythmic control mirrors musicality ("Bass of Anchors"), though "fractal generating" briefly drifts from prophet's lexicon under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero figurative muddle, but paraphrase loop in "Resonance was a drawing... traced it with strikes" prevents 9.5+; final image remains crystal clear despite density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical metaphysics with survival stakes; "dubbing" transforms obstacles organically through specific sonic logic without gimmickry, heightening coherence while taking bold structural risks.</comment>
