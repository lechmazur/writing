<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction emerges through embodied tension between censored voice and storm-driven urgency; micro-choices (timer placement, tracing scars) reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance earns stakes via scar cartography realization, though childhood window connection lacks prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "healed page" reweights scars through storm-lit understanding. Accumulative lens holds as scar/storm pattern intensifies pressure toward final alignment. Orientation clear by 40 words; cost legible in "path align with their own scar" beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Darkroom timer constrains choices (timing exposures) and charges final image ("courage would echo"). Observatory setting actively shapes tactics via lightning intervals and arterial lines. Micro-setting specificity (greasy envelope, milky camera) avoids white-room syndrome while filtering through poet's tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through scar cartography revelation; storm pressure narrows options to understanding. Cost crystallized in final image's "healed page" metaphor. One tightening suffices at this length, though "masks slip" timeframe could heighten urgency earlier to reach 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar/storm pattern without moralizing; "healed page" offers resonant non-literal answer to "where pain once told us we could not go." Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in concrete actions (tracing constellation, timing thunder). Final image reweights prior material through earned specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "marginalia on a page already argued with" and "arterial lines"; rhythm modulates from fragmented urgency to lyrical cadence under storm pressure. No head-hopping; focalization stays consistent through poet's sensory deprivation ("air rarefy around lungs").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in "bead of seconds crossing the wire" metaphor. Minor overwriting risk in "storm-kissed wonder" but offset by purposeful pattern. Final image’s "healed page" avoids muddle despite lyrical compression. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms censorship trope through scar cartography framework; "furiously tranquil" reframes resilience as active tension. Emotional specificity in ash-smudged fingers and bus timetable avoids generic resistance. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via observatory’s charged poise closure.</comment>
