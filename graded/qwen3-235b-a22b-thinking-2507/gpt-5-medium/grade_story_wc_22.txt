<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; motivation is clear but interiority remains observational rather than conflicted. Final choice to garden is earned through action ("fertilize with listening"), yet emotional layers stay surface-level without visible internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: reef remains dead while garden "unlaces" the battlefield, crystallizing the "submerged concord" treaty. Orientation anchors instantly ("purple sheen harbor"), but Phoenician prayer feels slightly ornamental in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty constrains every choice—salt-slick boards dictate movement, cracks hold fertilizer—and charges the final image ("blooming jetty, narrow as mercy"). Morning glories braiding planks transform bayonets into shelter, proving micro-setting’s essential role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("can growth apologize for war?") tighten through the coachman’s agency, yet escalation lacks visceral pressure spikes. The cost—reef’s irreversible death—anchors closure, but the shift from planting pods to pulling bayonets needs sharper causal weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "translates, not prays" and "fertilize with listening" reweight "submerged concord" without moralizing. Final image of battlefield "unlacing under green" offers resonant, non-literal answer to whether growth can hold ghosts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("seeds rustle like crows' feet on vellum"), with rhythm modulating under pressure—terse for planting, fluid for twilight. Slight register drift in "damp parchments" momentarily dilutes the coachman’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels with texture ("bats delete gnats"). "Narrow vastness" evolves to "narrow as mercy" with crystalline precision. Final line’s cadence pays off accumulated imagery without a single figurative misstep.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms war/garden trope via "submerged concord"—not reconciliation but a treaty between "brine memory and seed breath." Risk-taking (lyric density, dead languages) heightens stakes without obscuring the reef’s irreversible cost.</comment>
