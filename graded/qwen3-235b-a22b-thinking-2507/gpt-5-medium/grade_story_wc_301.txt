<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "River does what it was asked to do" shifting from verdict to instruction, but "methodical method" risks abstraction. Brother's death backstory anchors micro-choices without summary. Final renunciation earned through river entry's embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: stepping into the river reconfigures options with conceptual cost ("water took the number and returned a different one"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; graffiti coordinates deepen knowledge without causal breaks. Cost legible in "honest about its weight and mine."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy vein as "ledger entry" charges the final image, while bathroom tiles constrain choices as micro-setting. Station pressure manifests concretely: fox-slit embankment guides path, rusted sluice gate triggers memory. Avoids symbolism by making setting tactile ("mossed milestone matched the smeared numbers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through protagonist's agency: following graffiti transforms knowledge from "lazy certainty" to accepting river's truth. Escalation via textural deepening ("breathed until our rhythms met") reweights options with felt cost. No coincidences resolve conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete shift: "River does what it was asked to do" evolves from self-condemnation to instruction. Final image ("stop asking it to be me") reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in river's physical truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in cartographer noticing "map references disguised as jokes." Rhythm modulates perfectly: staccato "stepped in and counted to twelve" during river entry. No head-hopping; elision of brother's death taught early and paid off in sluice gate scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("daringly methodical" repetition) slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise exceptional density: "pews of nettle and pewter rails" compresses setting and emotion. No figurative muddle; final line's "ledger" metaphor charges closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms river trope through cartographer's lens: bathroom graffiti as map for grief. Emotional specificity in "hands on knees, breath like bellows" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, culminating in indispensable river entry.</comment>
