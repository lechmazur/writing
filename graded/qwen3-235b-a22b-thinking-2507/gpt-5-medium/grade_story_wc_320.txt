<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when narrator stops naming the blinking, yet grandmother’s "listen without keeping" risks thematic echo; embodied cost in leaving hush shard lands closure but ghost-dialogue friction slightly weakens micro-choice causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "left the hush in the mast" crystallizes cost of release, reconfiguring the city’s cyclical time; lunar perigee pressure tightens options via Accumulative lens, though ghost dialogue borderlines coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gorge as orchestra pit and mast as stylus transform setting into active constraint; the hush shard’s weight/lightness dichotomy charges the final image while the moon’s pull physically alters cable tension and blood flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake—"find the beginning in every ending"—drives tangible choices (tilting dishes, threading star fragment), with visible cost in relinquishing the hush; escalation via lunar perigee’s physical pull deepens stakes but ghost voices slightly diffuse protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Begin last, end first" note avoids moralizing by manifesting in action (threading star fragment), with final image reweighting abandonment as cyclical renewal; thematic resonance emerges through concrete acts like the hush shard clarifying echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct "fantasy practicality" voice ("testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder") persists under pressure; ghost dialogue carries subtext through "reel-dust" tremors without diagnostic labels, though slight register drift in matriarch’s line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Winds braided old advertisements into prayers" exemplifies textural propulsion; zero loops or scaffold, but "serenely electric" repetition risks mild density in high-pressure beats despite purposeful variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radio tower city transcends trope via "knitting shadows" and "grieving reels of tape"; lunar perigee’s fusion with human grief transforms template into fresh emotional calculus where endings "grow handles."</comment>
