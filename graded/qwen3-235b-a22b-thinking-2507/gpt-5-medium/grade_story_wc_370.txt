<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("staying while leaving") drive micro-choices organically; embodied cost in "uncreased spines" forecloses old reconciliation. Minor therapy-speak risk in "soothing looked like taking sides" barely avoids label penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "mistake as place" reweights premise through "uncreased spines" and cooled tea. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly from crumpled invitation to final mercy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crumbled invitation functions as micro-setting: constrains access as passport, charges final image when walking home "within arm's reach of midnight." Dust-to-lamp warmth evolution mirrors emotional thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: reading "Mistake and Wisdom" aloud together narrows options to braid meaning. Cost is unmistakable in "books rarely return to uncreased spines" foreclosing easy repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: paired books shelved oppositely, reading aloud as stitching. Final city image ("holds you without knowing you") resonates as non-literal answer to belonging without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile metaphors ("tea held steady like a hand"); stress compression shines in "knees knew the room." Rhythm modulates perfectly from "enlarged tranquility" to braid of meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "dust floated like waiting thoughts" establishes setting/emotion/time). Metaphors coherent even under pressure: "stitching and unstitching trust" avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "secret society" trope through mundane stationery shop; emotional truth in refusing old shapes. Risk-taking heightens stakes via "staying while leaving" as spatial/emotional state without gimmickry.</comment>
