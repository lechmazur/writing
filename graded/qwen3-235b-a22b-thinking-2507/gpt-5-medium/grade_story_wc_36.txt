<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "title fits like a scar" and refusal-turned-use of the flute, but "silence that bruises" edges toward label-speak; micro-choices (driftwood markers, note progression) concretely manifest flawed humility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("ravens carried my apology") under Accumulative/Textural lens; seamless pressure build via flute notes reconfigures stakes without causal gaps; "avalanchingly quiet" motif deepens final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flute and driftwood constrain choices (threading seams, marking lanes) and charge closure; "chalky dirt" and "dry bark" case embody setting; canyon hush evolves from oppressive to resonant without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via flute's autonomous note finding the seam, forcing confrontation with failure; cost legible in "ledger of timings" and market's fragile return; agency-driven deepening replaces reversal at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("threads need lanes as much as feet"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "canyon hush" into earned quiet without abstraction; "miscounts and pride" earns insight through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stones remember," "wind lied") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("avalanchingly quiet") pays off in closure; zero POV slippage despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "I came back to harvest insights from failure, not forgiveness" slightly stalls momentum; otherwise high density ("flute warmed as if remembering fingers not mine") with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving motif with relic-keeping; "driftwood as directional markers" transforms trope through specific stakes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
