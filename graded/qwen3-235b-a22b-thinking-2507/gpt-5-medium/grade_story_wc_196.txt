<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("broken-hearted archivist, tactfully hopeful") embodied through dust-reading ritual; final addendum choice earned by prior micro-choices like pinching proof. Micah's off-page presence avoids stock orphan tropes via bicycle-chain scratches on button.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is masterful Charged Poise: "unknown felt less cavern and more corridor" reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("heart still hurt, but it had company"). Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern density shifts narrowing options to reinterpretation, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choices (how archivist reads files) and charges final image ("dust composing tomorrow's map"). Button's physicality (sunburst scratches, blue-black thread) directly alters tactics when writing addendum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making meaning from unknown histories) tightens through button discovery, narrowing options from passive cataloging to active reinterpretation. Cost crystallizes in "heart still hurt, but it had company" under Accumulative lens without requiring physical action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("dust settling... composing tomorrow's map") offers non-literal answer to "unknown histories" question through prior particulars (breadcrumb maps, dust crescents), avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges from bike-chain scratches on button, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust settled on their boxes," "talc-gray air" filter world through archivist's tactile precision. Syntax modulates from clinical ("standardized sweater") to lyrical ("unfurl into the night") without POV drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cardboard coffin bowed inward" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final image ("dust composing tomorrow's map") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. "Exhaling a grit of rooms" risks mixed metaphor but earns payoff through file-grit motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope via archivist's dust-reading technique—specific verifiable detail (bus tokens for bike-clinic cookies) avoids quirkiness. Emotional truth in "kindness repeated" synthesizes mundane acts into fresh insight without sentimentality.</comment>
