<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chronologically homesick" tension and micro-choices like warming the shell to loosen "mute rooms," but closure lacks visible cost beyond exhaustion; the final copying act feels passive for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "the lake opens a seam like a smile no one can see," reconfiguring stakes through the nautilus shell's cooling echo under Accumulative/Textural lens, though "ruinous" method lacks tangible escalation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake constrain every choice—conducting "without frightening the silence," mapping timelines on frost—and charge the final image where "panes blushing with thaw" embodies earned transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through memory mapping as the dominant stake tightens, but escalation lacks visceral cost beyond fatigue; the hospital corridor's sudden appearance disrupts causal coherence in the Accumulative framework.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "fortunes were not riddles but instructions for breath" reweights prior material without moralizing, though "conductor of unheard symphonies" risks abstraction until the final edible time slivers ground it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whale-slow groans," "taste one and it is salt and paper") and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression ("draft after draft") taught early and paid off in the shell's cooling echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines like "the ice breathes in, out, in, out" propel with crystalline density, though "ruinous" slightly overwrites the method without deepening stakes in that beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the fortune cookie writer trope through synesthetic conducting ("diagram breaths on frost"), but the "mirrored horizon" concept leans on familiar lyric tropes without fresh moral calculus in the stakes.</comment>
