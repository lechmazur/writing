<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("charmed skeptic, blessed with doubt") drives choices, but micro-struggle during memory transfer lacks embodied specificity; "weight of years settle on my tongue" edges toward label-use despite strong overall voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "winter in my chest, a precise cold that did not sting" reconfigures the garden’s repetition; Accumulative lens holds perfectly as density tightens toward archiving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the seashell constrains every choice, charging the final image when "warm now" signifies transformation; "library of frost" reweights prior stakes through concrete, pressure-driven detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: sensory density ("crown of rusted gull cries") and cadence shifts ("map tones to gestures") narrow options until archiving becomes the only path, with visceral cost in the chest’s "precise cold".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: "library of frost where each pane contained instructions for thaw" reframes isolation without moralizing; avoids Thematic Echo by making wisdom inherent to the archiving act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless—"moths drifted with ghostly resolve" filters observation through character bias; rhythm accelerates during memory transfer ("breaths to footfalls") without sacrificing clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion, but "registration of past storms cataloging themselves" slightly overwrites in a high-pressure beat; otherwise zero loops and impeccable syntactic variation serving the Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms memory-archiving trope through "resonance structures" method and visceral stakes; "crown of rusted gull cries" offers irreplaceable specificity that reshapes the garden’s meaning in hindsight.</comment>
