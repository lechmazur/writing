<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: protagonist seeks fracture yet learns to "imprint trust," crystallized when sealing the bowl. Micro-choices like testing on the diver reveal hierarchy of values. Only slight over-reliance on metaphor ("mitosis of faith") risks abstracting emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "battered marvel" crystallizes transformed existence with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via aurora/shipwreck imagery toward the bowl's creation. Minor tension: "cells divide" motif slightly over-explains the change, diluting visceral impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains: shipwrecks provide the compass, drowned trees calibrate devices, greenhouse chains enable buoyancy metaphors. Final image charges the orchard ("trees clinking like cutlery") as micro-setting shaping the closure. No ornamental detail—every shell and chain serves the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the diver test (secondary pressure) before the patent betrayal climax. Cost is unmistakable in "battered marvel here"—permanent damage transformed but not erased. Agency drives escalation: protagonist's choices (testing bowl, sealing pattern) narrow options toward earned endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "imprinting trust" avoids moralizing. Final line ("forging futures from what was missing") reweights the central concept non-literally, charged by "battered marvel." No thematic echo—complexity lingers in "grief kept its architecture, but the rooms stopped collapsing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "Blue is a far drum, green a plucked wire" filters all observation. Rhythm modulates under pressure (staccato during fracture search, lyrical at forge). Compression taught early ("fault line turned instrument") pays off in closure without obfuscation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through dense imagery ("metronome carved from frostburn"). Minor density risk: "mitosis of faith" slightly over-explains but aligns with Accumulative lens. Final line ("battered marvel") recharges opening aurora imagery with devastating precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hearing aid designer in sunken orchard transforms betrayal into sound physics. Specificity ("shells cling to twigs by salted scars") avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes coherently—closure's "battered marvel" feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
