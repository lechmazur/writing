<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in handling burdens ("lightened by a pinch" yet "refuses to loosen"), but emotional progression occasionally abstracts ("measure of love") without sufficient embodied cost. Final choice to balance fear as "duty" earns closure with marrow-deep stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: density intensifies through burden collection until the final reconfiguration where "shingled hush became song." Cost crystallizes in ledger entries and the marrow-deep fear acceptance. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp's glow across "bronze skin of stone" directly constrains the weighing process, and the grotto's "whale skeleton" breath charges the final image. Every sensory detail (wet wool, frost-thin threads) serves the burden motif with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "calcify" threat and orientation mechanics, narrowing options until the soldier's name forces shared action. Cost manifests in the ledger's "tide marks" and the protagonist's trembling hand—visible prices that alter how burdens are held.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: "weigh griefs" evolves into "translation of gravity itself." Final image ("shingled hush became song") reweights the opening hush without moralizing, showing burdens finding "chosen way to rest" through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("river scooped a throat in stone") modulates under pressure; syntax fractures ("boundary-lessly trapped") during high stakes. Fractal Weaver's dialogue carries subtext through implied loom mechanics, never stating the thesis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost evaporating at sunrise" shows rather than tells. Minor overwriting in "echoes clicked as coins discussing afterlife" slightly muddles closure beat, but rhythmic control ("shoulders angled like sails") sustains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "weighing grief" trope through bronze grotto physics and fractal mechanics. The "shingled hush" concept synthesizes setting/theme with risk-taking—"dread like a locked window" feels inevitable yet unprecedented in its tactile precision.</comment>
