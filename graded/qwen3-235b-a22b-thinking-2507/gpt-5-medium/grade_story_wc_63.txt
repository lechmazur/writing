<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rigid precision vs. ethical mending) drive micro-choices under pressure; "grief were slop in the bearings" crystallizes embodied cost. Final shared carving earns closure through prior causality without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "I forgot the listening when storms took his skiff" makes grief visceral. Accumulative lens holds through density surge during the pendulum pause, reweighting "shared balance" with tidal ridge's emergent debts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices (rake handle discovery, final meeting) and charging closure with "mirror shards of night." Sensory details like "brass scarred by salt" reflect professional priorities without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: the pendulum pause tightens temporal pressure, forcing "tiny true cuts" as moral calculus. Cost legible in "corrected fisherman publicly" flashback during the stillness, narrowing options to incremental mending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rake handle notches rather than statement; final carving of child's name offers resonant answer to "how to cleanse." Avoids moralizing via concrete particulars like "bread cooling" hissing, rejecting "line knifed through time" abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in timekeeper's lexicon ("plank of silence," "worn tooth to shim with reed"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during pendulum pause ("Moonlight veers, gulls tilt") avoid syntactic monotony while compressing diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tidal obsidian ridge inside the tower" merges setting and psyche without muddle. Final line "tower has finally learned to listen" recharges motif with propulsion, avoiding closure-beat artifacts. Figurative density serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms clock tower trope via specific verifiable details (rake handle notches for mended talks). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through "woven wake" metaphor, avoiding safety middle with "precision without regard becomes injury" complexity.</comment>
