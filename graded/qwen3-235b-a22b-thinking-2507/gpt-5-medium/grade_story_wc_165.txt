<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feral in edges, disciplined in aim" but janitor's grief lacks embodied specificity beyond dialogue; "grief moves like a bishop" insight earned through prior action yet emotional cost feels slightly conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when janitor returns the bishop—hesitation embodies cost—but "objects are not souvenirs" line risks slight thematic echo, narrowly avoiding Q5 penalty by being character-voiced wisdom rather than authorial moral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arcade functions as active micro-setting: puddles constrain chess moves, chalk lines dissolve under tide, and "moonwater" breathes through arches—environment directly shapes the bishop's final journey across water to charge the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via performer's agency—tilting bishop to catch drip, balancing coin on water—narrows options toward the janitor's silent confession; cost crystallizes in the returned bishop, reweighting "orchestrated serendipity" as fragile human connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: janitor's pawn/bishop ritual reframes grief as diagonal motion, and final image of "training a puppy made of photons" resonates without moralizing—reweights serendipity as patient, imperfect stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("nickel nebulae," "tide gnaws chalk lines") creates distinct voice; rhythm modulates from "calculated wilderness" to quiet resolution, with "moon yards itself" showing syntactic control under pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drip perches on its miter" exemplifies high-density imagery, though "sympathy of old maps" slightly strains metaphor coherence in peak pressure—minor artifact avoiding Q7 penalty due to voice consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms street performer trope via chess/math lens: "orchestrated serendipity" avoids gimmickry through tactile details (coin circles, bishop on water), yet emotional specificity in janitor's backstory feels slightly compressed for 800 words.</comment>
