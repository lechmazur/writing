<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between "blessed pariah" status and solitary sketching ritual drives the earned endurance; embodied emotion in "headache rose like a tide under bone" avoids label-speak while layering grief and resolve during the star-drawing crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("headache rose like a tide") when layered sketches forge "a navigable field"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density intensifies through temporal peeling of constellations without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time dilation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (slow time enables glacial ink-drying observation) and charges closure through "temporally stretched hymn"; compass rose applique's physical weight becomes the final image's constraint-shaping tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist's agency in redefining true north ("drew the planets as they flowered") under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in the physical toll of "headache" during the star-migration crisis and the emotional weight of the blackout anniversary date.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the compass rose's redefinition ("past, present, elsewhere, return") and closure's non-literal answer "We will not fear the dark we carry"; avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in the sketching ritual's tactile persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "city lights below slowed to a hum, each car a beetle dragging time" shows character-specific bias; rhythmic control under pressure ("patient as moss") teaches and pays off the time-dilation pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "constellations peeled away like petals unfolding too slowly to believe" demonstrates high density where metaphor serves temporal tension without muddle; final line's "true north I had drawn" achieves propulsion through crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation physics with generational memory rituals feels inevitable; risk-taking in redefining compass points as temporal dimensions heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through the sketchbook's tactile logic.</comment>
