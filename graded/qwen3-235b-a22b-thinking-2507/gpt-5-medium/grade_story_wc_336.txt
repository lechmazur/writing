<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between preserving wonder and confronting exhaustion is embodied in pruning choices, but child's role lacks sufficient micro-tension to deepen stakes; "color of wonder" epiphany slightly unearned despite strong sap/memory texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (valley's fading memory made tangible through seed planting), though accumulative lens clarity falters slightly pre-midpoint; orientation perfect with mist-waterfall anchoring by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Waterfall's mist-beaded crack functions as indispensable micro-setting that charges closure; seed's "unnamed color" transforms from object to active constraint when planted where "worlds greet each other," though orchard details occasionally verge on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder's taste) tightens through seed's transformation from inert object to "hungry" vessel; escalation driven by Miren's agency in pruning for testimony, but child's arrival relies slightly on coincidence rather than causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (apples tasting "like first light" vs. "tired"), but "color of wonder" borders on thematic echo; final image ("memory of a lantern in fog") resonantly answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sap/memory lens) shines, but filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("Miren felt insatiably creative") dull immediacy; rhythmic control strong despite minor register drift toward abstraction during seed's glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but scaffold issues in lyrical passages ("radiant hush" repetition) and borderline abstract phrasing ("color of wonder itself") slightly muddle high-pressure beats; seed's transformation maintains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard pruning with memory preservation feels inevitable; "weaving between worlds" transcends trope through specific stakes (apples tasting of war harvests), though risk-taking edges toward poetic abstraction in mid-beats.</comment>
