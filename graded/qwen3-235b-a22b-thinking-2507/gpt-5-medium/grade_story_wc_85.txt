<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("recording the heart" vs "ledger aches with forgery") embodied through salt-stained watch hand and micro-choice to kneel on the shore. Mara's tempered regret lacks sufficient physical manifestation during pivotal confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with "holding silence like a lantern with shutters" and "sea accepted the paper," making conceptual cost undeniable. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through driftwood plank discoveries tightening options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choices (kneeling/searching) and charges final image ("publish the names the tide preserved"). Salt-stained watch hand's "compass" quality directly shapes the closure's tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in plank search, narrowing options to truth/forgery confrontation. "Withheld truth weighed... a patient tide changing stone" makes cost legible, though Mara's lack of visible resistance slightly softens the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of publishing names "in kitchens and on balconies" offers resonant answer to central question about inherited truth without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from driftwood system's transformation from marketable artifact to communal archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sea breathing like a tired archivist," "gulls stitched small commas") maintains rhythmic control through stress. Purposeful compression of backstory taught early via watch-hand vow and paid off in Abel revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("bartered the rest of the timepiece" compresses moral cost), though "sentence landed as soft as a stone" creates minor metaphor friction in peak confrontation without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogy-as-black-market through maritime archaeology; "driftwood carvings as ledger" transforms trope. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "boy ferrying records" revelation edges toward convenient.</comment>
