<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; protagonist passively receives guidance without micro-choices (e.g., "She led me to a table" vs active struggle with buried accent). Final renunciation feels unearned despite vivid sensory cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (moving "shame-encyclopedias" reconfigures emotional space), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure weakens when seer drives all escalation ("Hold fast, she said").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore functions as essential micro-setting: shelves constrain movement ("aisles curled into cul-de-sacs"), stone charges closure ("hummed like a throat"), and "shame-encyclopedias" physically manifest emotional cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes lack protagonist-driven escalation; seer dictates all pressure ("Hold fast, she said"). Buried-talents conflict narrows options only via external intervention, not organic trade-offs—protagonist never actively chooses between shame and expression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through "shame-encyclopedias" and "vowels house," but final paragraph moralizing ("home was not a dwelling but a practice") triggers -0.6 penalty for stated thesis, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("books smelled like old rivers and flint"), but dialogue lacks subtext—seer’s lines feel instructional ("Touch it... think of your first shadow") rather than character-revealing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Final-third template cadence ("I would seed... I would seed...") creates paraphrase loops; "gritty with riverbed, soft with permission" shows mixed metaphor in climax beat. Otherwise exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "bookstore" trope through mountain-ivy synesthesia and "mercury-glass" seer, but "buried talents" premise leans on familiar self-acceptance arc without fresh moral calculus beyond personal revelation.</comment>
