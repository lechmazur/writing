<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "stubborn ears" philosophy vs. director's demand for certainty; embodied emotion in "coaxed capacitors with slow heat of my palm" reveals character under pressure. Micro-choice to restructure instruments despite uncertainty earns the closure's conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: chronometer's reassembled pause crystallizes the stance shift ("unlearn the Moon owed us silence") with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through the leaf motif's evolution, with cost legible in "shaken loose a stubbornness" and the final photon memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Camera tools constrain choices decisively—the sanded burr on the arbor and loosened mounting collar directly charge the final image. Lunar observatory's micro-setting (cloud sea "starved of sound") forces tactile problem-solving, making environment indispensable to the repair climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: quake-induced alignment shift (0.0001mm error) drives restructure decision. Cost is felt in "shaken loose a stubbornness," but landslide coincidence slightly undercuts pure accumulation; pressure grows via sensor cooling lines "breathing like a sleeping animal" to the intimate moon image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "faint heat in dust that remembered shock" answers "harness the ephemeral" without moralizing. Final leaf memory reweights the premise ("fleeting as any photon"), but "dared ourselves to hope" edges toward sentimentality, narrowly avoiding thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "traffic of electrons at midnight" and "sang like glass touched with wet finger" embody camera repairer's lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the repair sequence; no head-hopping despite director's silent presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "braided shadows that looked like writing" exemplifies high-density imagery. Slight register drift in "ephemeral" (para 4) risks academic tone but is redeemed by "pawprints of noise." Final line's photon metaphor avoids overwriting through concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms lunar observation tropes through camera repairer's tactile lens—moon "quiver" as heat sink, not celestial drama. Fresh inflection in "sanded [burr] with breath," but "luminous ache" risks familiar phrasing. Avoids safety middle via conceptual stakes over technical triumph.</comment>
