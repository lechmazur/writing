<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority shines through concrete action ("palms memorizing the friction’s grammar") not abstraction; contradictory impulses (clarity vs. embracing absence) drive the rope-reconfiguration climax with visible cost in his "calmer heart."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the door vanishing after seal/ledger merge reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost ("calmer heart," "newly breathable" air); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (crossing strands dims door); its final image ("tucking in a sleeping child") charges closure by embodying the story’s "clear complexity" theme through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (translating absence) tighten through rope manipulation: crossing strands narrows options by dimming the door, uncrossing brightens it; the seal application forecloses the doorway with felt cost in the archivist’s emotional shift from tension to calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—the ledger’s restoration crystallizes "absence becomes a bridge" without moralizing; final line ("wound the rope... into a knot that held") reweights the concept non-literally while honoring ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("draft that smelled like vellum," "catalog numbers rearranging") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyrical compression ("gaps multiplied like rain puddles") is taught early and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("palms memorizing the friction’s grammar") advances plot and theme simultaneously; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the seal’s "thirst" for purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes through specific mechanics (rope braids as historical conduit); emotional truth in quiet dedication avoids gimmickry while "fables of absence" offers a non-obvious synthesis of loss and order.</comment>
