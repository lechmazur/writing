<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shyly unstoppable" micro-choices (doubts as "stubborn seed of storm weather" yet reef-building), but Gardener's arrival lacks sufficient friction; "stop confusing sharpness with safety" borders on therapy-speak without embodied cost in peak consent moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "I still wake often, but I rise gentler" crystallizes the insomnia-to-tending transformation under Accumulative lens, where "tides rock the shell home" reweights prior struggle into sustainable action with undeniable emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell functions as essential micro-setting—doubts "resurfacing like breath" in its confines directly constrains choices, while final "tides rock the shell home" charges closure with environmental intimacy, proving specificity's necessity for 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: "photosynthesize pain into beauty" evolves from abstract motive to tangible "sorrows... woven from losses turning them into lanterns," with cost legible in ongoing insomnia now "tended" rather than conquered, narrowing options to gentle endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through "blossom armistice" reconfiguration—from metaphor to "breath signatures" vow—avoiding moralizing, though "stop confusing solitude with worth" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied struggle in the Gardener's ultimatum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("curated darkness like a library, indexing heartbeats") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" recurrence teaches pattern early and pays off in choir transformation, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pearled slabs" to "pearl dust" evolution shows high density, but "stalemates can learn tenderness" risks abstract diction in high-pressure beat—saved by concrete "listened without defenses," avoiding closure artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insomnia-as-tide and pain-photosynthesis feels inevitable; "reef builds itself from patient bones" transforms trope through specific marine biology, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring closure's emotional cost.</comment>
