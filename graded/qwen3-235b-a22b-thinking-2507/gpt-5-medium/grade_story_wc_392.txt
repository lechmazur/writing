<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when turning off radios to honor "evidence covering your boots," but father's ship memory edges toward summary rather than showing transformation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "my calm now watchful because it chose" crystallizes stance with visible career cost, under Accumulative/Textural lens where salt-locked drains and missed nod reweight safety protocols.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Tunnel isn't backdrop but active constraint—salt-crusted grates physically prevent drainage, forcing the drowning; lantern's vapor-drawing wick charges the final release into the exhaled city.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen relentlessly: supervisor's chimes escalate to "algorithm liked easy drownings," narrowing options until investigator's radio silence becomes the only ethical choice with tangible professional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>"Risk becomes safety only when communities share it" emerges through workers' fatal wait for a nod, never stated outright; final rain metronome implies systemic repair without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "minuscule ripples slide toward drain grates and stall" filters crisis through investigator's trained eye, with syntax tightening under pressure at the lantern's flare.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every phrase advances tension ("salt had crusted... white teeth of thirst")—though "sedimented into the object" slightly drifts from POV lexicon in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms investigative trope through poetic precision: drownings caused by waiting inches of water, not floods, with "quorum of stillness" revealing how discipline drowns more surely than water.</comment>
