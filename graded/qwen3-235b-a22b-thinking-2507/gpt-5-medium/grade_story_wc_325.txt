<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "panic hummed, but I counted drips" and embodied claustrophobia during the entrance squeeze; micro-choices like measuring air seams with lips reveal hierarchy of values under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost when the machine acknowledges the thief ("Return when you can bear the room"), reconfiguring the protagonist's self-worth under Accumulative/Textural lens; rising tide forces irreversible departure with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cave’s physical constraints (narrowing walls, tidal pressure) actively shape every choice; the gold fleck’s phase-transition mechanics charge the final image as it’s left behind, transforming from stolen object to communal anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as the rising tide forces a single decisive choice: return the fleck before drowning, with cost crystallized in leaving it behind to honor the team; pressure coheres via Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of being "unnoticed" resonates through concrete actions—speaking names aloud, pressing RETURN—culminating in the machine’s footnote that reweights the protagonist’s theft as belonging, avoiding moralizing while charging the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("currents slicking my skin, air seams whispering") persists under stress; rhythmic control shifts from fragmented tension in squeezes to flowing cadence during terminal interaction, with all elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("belly against rock, breath rationed" compresses physical/emotional cost); figurative language ("frost lacquered it delicate") enhances rather than obscures phase-transition mechanics in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia, archival duty, and phase-transition physics feels inevitable; risk-taking in making undersea cables a conduit for human resonance (not plot device) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored in specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
