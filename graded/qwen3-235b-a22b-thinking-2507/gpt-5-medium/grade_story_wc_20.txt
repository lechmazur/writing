<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. grief) act simultaneously in "drying and refilling" experiments; final renunciation of healing for "held together" earns closure through prior causality with conceptual cost ("heavier without gaining mass").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance ("I am not healed, but I am held together") with undeniable conceptual cost in "heavier without gaining mass"; Accumulative lens holds through patterned weighing experiments that reweight the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (assay cup/furnace) constrains choices at climax when feeding "her name" into fire; final image "foundry glows like a memory" charges closure through tactile specificity ("slag river," "rainwater").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (proving names have weight) tightens through protagonist's agency in repeated weighing experiments; conceptual cost ("sorrow had mass") is unmistakable in the coin's imbalance during Mara's name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (kintsugi repair, alloy melting) not abstraction; final image "precisely remembered" offers resonant non-literal answer to grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("syllable that left golden soot," "frogs practiced a grammar") shows selective bias; rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("beam tremble like a breath deciding") with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("Libra stared... as if balance were not already the ghost tonguing my every step") advances multiple dimensions without muddle; final line recharges "luminous regret" with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through alchemical lens ("kintsugi intentions gleaming like patient lightning"); specific synthesis of "factually mystical" world logic feels inevitable in hindsight with risk-taking cohesion.</comment>
