<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through action: "Question the flood as happenstance" reveals simultaneous suspicion/endurance without therapy-speak. Final choice to hide the stamp earns renunciation via prior causality ("tired of rehearsals"), with the city's tilt crystallizing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "the city tilt in my mind" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increase ("ledgers redacted with sailcloth scabs") tightens pressure without causal turns. Orientation clear by line 5 ("sunken city far below tideline").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (stamp) charges closure: its "violet oval like a held breath" on the news bill enables the revelation of redacted imports, constraining Ossa's truth-seeking. Sensory hierarchy masterful—salt-weeping books and crab clicks filter through her archival focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: "trace honest origins" becomes visceral when pressure reveals redacted imports as "weight that drags a thing into the grave." Cost crystallizes in the registrar's margin note—"Lowered to keep the gold in reach"—reweighting the flood's meaning with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "weight that drags a thing into the grave while calling it saved" reframes "honest origins" as complicit erasure. Final image ("stillness clung to spines") offers resonant answer to central question—truth requires enduring reclaimed quiet amid manipulated history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defines voice: "ink smelled like the outsides of plums" reveals Ossa's archival lens. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in blackout sequences ("proof stands out from rumor like ink separating from water"), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via textural density ("ledgers redacted with squares of sailcloth glued like scabs"). One paraphrase near stamp discovery ("cracks feathered... ghost of violet ink") barely avoids penalty but prevents 9.0+ per global policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sunken-library archivist using ink stamp to dissect flood mythology transforms archival tropes. "Lowered, not lost" reconfiguration feels inevitable through prior particulars (redacted imports, "persuasive guilt"), avoiding abstraction with visceral stakes.</comment>
