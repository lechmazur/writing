<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs craving openness) drives choices; embodied "pulse burr like trapped moth" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice releasing hushed silence reveals hierarchy of values. Slight deduction for "intangibly tangible" label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly: father's blueprint softening shows tangible cost of redefined safety ("safe like stepping into a room you have never left"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation; gravity inversion anchors orientation by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trellis functions as micro-setting: "rooms with no corners" directly constrains claustrophobia, while doll's porcelain cavity charges final image as "second heart." Body/tool (doll) constrains choices and charges closure, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening when doll releases gilded hush forces father's stance crystallization; blueprint softening shows visible cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens via density increase (silence tastings) reweights safety concept. Minor deduction for gentle escalation pace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: honey/linen silence reweights "safety" without moralizing. Final "silence that tastes of beginnings" offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids Thematic Echo despite "home" mention—earned through prior sensory work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste how quiet changes shape") with rhythmic control; "stretching contracted like a lung" modulates under pressure. Non-standard "xenial" usage taught early and paid off. Zero head-hopping; voice consistent through emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion: "bells loosen... float past like dandelion seeds" weaves action/image. Minor deduction for "silence sprout" grammatical hiccup in closure beat, but doesn't obscure cost. Zero loops or scaffold in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia/silence through taste metaphors; gravity inversion trope transformed by "ladders sprout from drains" specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in "bones dusted with pollen" avoids abstraction.</comment>
