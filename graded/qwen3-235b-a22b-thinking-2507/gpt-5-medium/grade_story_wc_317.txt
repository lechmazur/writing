<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("innovation hated fluorescent ceilings" vs. landlord pressures) manifests in micro-choices like drafting rules on a napkin, but the landlord conflict remains abstract without active opposition, diluting the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("nerves sink beside it," "profit would trickle") under Accumulative/Textural lens; the final bow crystallizes stewardship stakes, though landlord threat lacks sufficient on-page testing to maximize cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed and brook constrain choices (e.g., "pressing seed into darkness" alters tactics) and charge the final image; sensory details like "damp in the planks" and "cedar and ozone" are purposefully filtered through Mara's occupational priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency (drafting rules, rehearsing pitch) under Accumulative lens, but the landlord pressure remains declared rather than viscerally tested; cost ("profit would trickle") is legible yet lacks concrete on-page consequence to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "orthogonal approaches" and nurturing metaphors without moralizing; the final image ("bowing to the pot") reweights innovation as quiet stewardship, though "the world needs that laboratory" edges toward thematic echo in the pitch rehearsal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mail slot clicked like a metronome") and rhythmic control persist under pressure; purposeful compression ("across the hush of a possibility") is taught early and pays off in the closure's charged stillness without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "storm-born silence answered like a vow renewed" risks mixed metaphor; near-closure "possibility kept watch like a patient lantern" slightly overwrites, dulling the pot-bowing image’s immediacy by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes escape rooms with corpse flower symbolism into fresh "innovation as slow stewardship" premise; risk-taking in rejecting spectacle ("wrong stranger") heightens stakes coherently, though mystery seed mail leans slightly tropey without deeper transformation.</comment>
