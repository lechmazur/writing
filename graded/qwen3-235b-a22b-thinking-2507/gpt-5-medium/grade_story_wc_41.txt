<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("pre cognitively forgetful") manifests in micro-choices (arranging driftwood for future self) with embodied cost; flaw-driven action ("misplacing tomorrow") intensifies pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("saw the chalked lines fading, and loved them for it"), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (causal expectations delay recognition of accumulative/textural design until driftwood compass section).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, tide, and chalk constrain choices (ear-to-metal listening, resetting markers) and charge the final image ("statues remembered for him"); sensory specificity ("salt-thread pulling from him") embodies theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing "sound of growing older") tightens through protagonist agency (chalk markings, driftwood arrows), but escalation relies on lyric density over causal pressure; cost ("forgettings he had not yet suffered") is legible yet slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chalk dust turning to milk, "laughter wearing a limp"), with final image reweighting "clinging to echoes" as statues remember for him—zero moralizing, pure resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("listened with thin bones of wrists") and rhythmic control ("gulls braided their cries into static") persist under pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught early (tapes as silent witnesses) and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("chalk fell... ticking against the plinth like a metronome" slightly elevates register in peak beat); zero loops, but "metronome" simile risks minor voice drift from character lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time/memory tropes via tide-salt physics and "pre cognitively forgetful" specificity; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
