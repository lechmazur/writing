<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mislabeled bell backstory; "technically gentle" manifests as micro-choices (gloved fingers testing braid resistance) not labels. Final forgiveness earned through grandmother bell's year-long apology arc with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "exhaustion came... names still sounding" crystallizes perpetual remembrance duty. Accumulative lens holds throughout—aurora/sound density tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Ceremonial rope micro-setting constrains every choice (braid adjustments triggering shutter/horn), culminating in "rope and I learned each other." Icebound sanctum actively pressures process—breath roses on furnace, heat/ice crackle—charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single tightening (braid reconfiguration narrowing options to activate bells) perfectly fits length. Cost is visceral: "smell like pennies and pine sap" during pouring, exhaustion against ongoing names. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bells said more than forgive; they said stay, cast, listen"—concrete verbs reweighting "transcribed memory" without moralizing. Final snow seam image resonates with "names truer when air must say them," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "draftlines," "consonant like a boot heel." Rhythmic compression under stress ("Heat climbed, ice crackled") avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within caster's plausible voice ("domestic stars" for bronze).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "snowmelt ardor" avoids cliché. Minor dip for "I am technically gentle" explanation, but redeemed by immediate application ("hands know where not to push"). Peak-beat propulsion flawless: "vowels and a consonant like a boot heel."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms casting tropes via punched card scrap as "perforated ghosts." Emotional specificity in "midwife with rasp pulling ribs" avoids genericity. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—bells speaking syllables feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
