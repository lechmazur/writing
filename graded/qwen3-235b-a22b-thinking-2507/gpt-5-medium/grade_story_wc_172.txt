<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (whispering "Release" while denying sentiment), but the ritual's ease lacks struggle—no physical resistance from the salt or emotional pushback during the egg's disintegration weakens the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("eyes watered, a sentimental leak" + "case now lighter"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; density intensifies through the egg's powder drift triggering the speakers' chorus, reweighting "forgivable" as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Salt flat actively constrains choices (cuts boots, preserves "fingerprints like brittle lace") and charges the final image—pressing his palm to salt for "proof"—making environment indispensable to the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the egg's disintegration ("powder drifted like frost"), but the drought's human cost ("Bodies drank his water") remains abstract; escalation lacks visceral trade-offs beyond his emotional leak, slightly muting the cost's scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from concrete action ("corridors need music to stay"), avoiding moralizing; the final "nearly forgiven" rain reweights his guilt without stating a moral, achieving Conceptual Repricing through the egg's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight—the philanthropist notices "fractured grace" and "loose tin" motives—while rhythmic control under pressure ("breath came back to him, stuttering") heightens the ritual's tension without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thunder unrolled like carpet toward him" exemplifies multi-purpose propulsion. One borderline-dense metaphor ("corridors need music to stay") barely avoids muddle in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms eco-guilt tropes via specific ingenuity (egg as bell, tuning fork from Lima), but the "nearly forgiven" resolution risks sentimentality—saved by the salt's unyielding sting and manufactured rain's irony.</comment>
