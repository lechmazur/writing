<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shame tried retreating" and "brother refusing the old pull," with embodied emotion avoiding labels. Silent guardian's limited POV constrains relationship depth but serves the Accumulative lens. Brother's suicide backstory anchors motivation without over-explanation. Micro-choice to share the secret earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via "water kept the lesson" with undeniable cost in brother's suicide. Accumulative lens holds through light-pattern escalation reweighting darkness. Orientation anchors instantly with "cobalt dock after rain." Cost proof solid in "my brother had chosen that darkness," foreclosing silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dental mirror (tool) constrains choices by manipulating light on water and charges the final image ("cupped, a small star"). Shutters evolve from "chatter" to "sequence of forgiveness," altering tactics. Micro-setting specificity ("footprints fill and empty") replaces generic dock description. Recurring water motif directly shapes the closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—overcoming silence through shared grief—tightens when narrator reveals the brother's suicide secret. Agency manifests in "voice returned like floodwater," driven by mirror/shutter patterns under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "clean drop from the bridge," altering the narrator's emotional state visibly. Pressure coheres through escalating light manipulations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions: mirror teaching "darkness the value of stars" reweights brother's suicide without moralizing. Final image "night newly complicated by stars" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo despite internal thought about "teaching darkness," as insight arises from concrete struggle. Complexity honored in grief's "folded sails" with no false redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "Rain left the dock the color of cobalt, slick as a whispered oath" filters all details through grief-tinted observation. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—"palm damp and expectant" compresses syntax appropriately. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "spiralingly calm" repetitions. Voice remains consistent even during high-stakes revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised clouds" to "drowned arches" evolves imagery without muddle. Each line advances atmosphere or character: "rope snoring" conveys barge movement while deepening tone. Final line "city felt slightly less alone" avoids sentimentality through concrete action. Propulsion maintained even in reflective beats like brother's backstory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via dental mirror as light-tool instead of clichéd symbol. Specificity of "tar and nettle" smell and "carved rings" on pilings creates freshness without quirk. Emotional truth in brother's "clean drop" avoids generic suicide portrayal. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through shutter patterns.</comment>
