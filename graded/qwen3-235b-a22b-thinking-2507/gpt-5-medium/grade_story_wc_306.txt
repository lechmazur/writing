<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") drives choice with embodied cost in the cloak's weight and hollow mirror, but Lark's physical reactions during decision lack granular specificity beyond "protected vulnerability."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Lark's confession choice forecloses hiding paths with felt cost in her "shell mistaken for armor," though orientation anchors ("breezy lighthouse") arrive at 130 words—barely escaping penalty due to functional disorientation serving doubt theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse chimes function as micro-setting that constrains choice via the keeper's code, while the cloak of doubt charges the final image as "weather report that warns without panicking," fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via chime readings ("give it all back," "keep quiet," "speak and set terms") narrows options under Accumulative lens with visceral cost in Lark's political vulnerability, though dawn's timeframe lacks urgent time pressure beyond atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hollow mirror's final reprise—"only show what you bring to its edge"—reweighting "welcome nuance into certainty" without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo despite conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("I sell the weight of hesitation") sustains rhythmic control through high-pressure beats; non-standard punctuation (e.g., em-dashes for wind-chime cadence) serves voice without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density propel momentum, though "ceremonial garment for someone who refuses to trust a single drumbeat" slightly overwrites in a peak beat, costing 0.3 without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "conscience for hire" with wind-chime divination transforms political dilemma through specific doubt mechanics; risks bold conceptual framing that deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
