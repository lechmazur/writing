<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through concrete micro-choices (adjusting mirror angle, steadying breath) rather than abstract declaration; embodied contradiction in "calm panic of recognition" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of trophies for pathways earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "I felt no panic, only a wider field of view" crystallizes the cost of fragmented perspective. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (three pulses deepening excavation) with canyon's physical quake mirroring conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon functions as micro-setting: mica glitter constrains mirror's path, seismic shifts alter tactics, and final "canyon's breath" recharges the opening motif. Body (breathing) and tool (mirror shards) directly charge closure through "careful improvisation."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: each mirror pulse narrows options (school corridor → deeper neuronal tide → seam opening), with felt cost in the shattered mirror's "wider field of view." Single escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (half-built kite, sheet music) rather than abstraction; final image of "tending seams where futures and fossils converse" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," equations in eyes) and rhythmic control under pressure ("chirr of shocked crickets" to "cold air threaded like memory"). Elision of colleague's backstory taught early and paid off in excavation scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("each fissure became a notch filter") with clear propulsion. Figurative language ("static hair," "mineral and gentle" dreams) avoids muddle in peak beats while serving Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms familiar "abandoned dreams" trope through engineer's synaptic plasticity framework; specificity of "copper traces etched like fossilized whirlpool" creates freshness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
