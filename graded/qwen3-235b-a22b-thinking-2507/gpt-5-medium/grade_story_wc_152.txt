<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "disguising wisdom as foolishness" driving micro-choices like pricking finger to reveal truth; keeper's underdevelopment limits relationship crucible despite palpable wrist tremors during embroidery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as names "slip into fibers" with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through embroidery unraveling, though keeper's passive role slightly weakens causal pressure escalation at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eternal candle constrains choices (cupping flame, ash coastline) and charges final image; "dust made constellations" exemplifies setting charging theme, though occupational specifics lack deeper integration with stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through embroidery's physical unraveling ("soft laughter leaked"), crystallizing in "you will be blamed" with visible cost in stained cloth; keeper's pressure remains underutilized for full escalation potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "unraveling conspiracies is easing knots," reweighted by final image of names as stains; avoids moralizing but "fools stitch kingdoms" risks slight thematic echo near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "rumor is a wandering star" and dust constellations; minor register drift in "adjacent possibilities" but compression taught early ("listening is my craft") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("candle flame contracted" avoids filter verbs); slight overwriting in "corridors beside corridors" repetition but no closure artifacts, maintaining propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy unraveling tool; "starwash" water elevates specificity but observatory setting leans slightly generic, limiting transformative risk-taking at highest band.</comment>
