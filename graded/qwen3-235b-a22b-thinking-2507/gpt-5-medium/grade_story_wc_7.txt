<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pruning as both nurturing and violent act; micro-choices like spitting "confession" onto soil show embodied emotion. Flaw: brother's scarf memory lacks setup for this specific cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with neighbors tasting soup—rebuilding "quietly and together" crystallizes options with felt cost of vulnerability. Lens (Accumulative) holds: sensory density tightens into communal action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains every choice (bent door sighs, cracked panes) and charges final image—rebuilding begins in this very ruin. Copper-toned soup mirrors greenhouse's "bark veined with copper" for organic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing through memory-food) tightens via pruning cuts that yield bitter tastes. Cost escalates from sap's "ache of numbers" to council's threat, narrowing options to quiet rebellion with visible social risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "rebellion was gentle, like watering a rumor." Final image rejects tidy morals—soup rebuilds the city "we refuse to discard," charging prior ruins with earned hope without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in taste synesthesia ("tongue pricked as if tasting lightning"). Voice modulates perfectly: lyrical during planting, compressed during pruning cuts, communal in finale—zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose sings with "dough awake" and "shadows curved like commas," but "synaptic plasticity" slightly jars in high-pressure pruning beat. No loops; final line’s "rebuilding with flavors" delivers closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "memory food" trope through chef’s mechanic-like dress and neighborly speech. The "knowledge fruit" concept feels inevitable: pruning as editing letters to our future selves redefines gentle rebellion with emotional specificity.</comment>
