<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradictions ("I am just the last person who said yes") and micro-choices like pressing sea glass into palm during hauntings. Final renunciation of solitude earns cost via "five stones for love," though skipper's off-page role slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "five stones where waves could almost reach them" crystallizes safety-as-vulnerability with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sea glass/stones reweighting, though stone-stacking mechanics could deepen mid-beat pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sea glass constrains choice (candlelit search) and charges closure as "small green lighthouse." Lantern room's haunting pressure shapes tactics via dust/fog imagery. Moonlight on stones reweights setting as active messenger, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bottling safety) tightens through storm's lamp failure into physical cost (drowned keeper myth). Agency shown via stone-stacking choices, but skipper's silent role slightly blurs escalation—pressure accumulates rather than narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "luminescent ache" reframing safety as shared vulnerability. Final image of stones "speaking privately to souls in fog" answers central question without moralizing, though "safety is not absence of loss" risks thematic echo (saved by immediate sea glass embodiment).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves wore moonlight") modulates rhythm from fragmented ("gulls trade cries") to flowing ("candle brightened as if gratified"). Focalization stays anchored in keeper's lexicon—zero filter verbs even during hauntings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "candle smoke, salt, and softened paper" exemplifies high-density closure. Minor deduction for "reticent" repetition in opening, but "wings brushed glass where fog swirled like breath" shows masterful rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via stone-message system and "hauntings as kindness." Emotional truth in anonymous letters ("soup tastes less lonely") avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
