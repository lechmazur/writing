<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through the pen nib's duality (tool vs. compass) and the heiress's shift from observer to actor, but the board call resolution lacks sufficient micro-choice escalation to fully earn the decisive change under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when the reopened lens pours "daylight like warm inquiry" after the board confrontation, with conceptual cost crystallized in "gravity is a fine servant and a poor god"—a resonant reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib constrains choices (wager tool/reflection surface) and charges the final image where it rests "a small spike," transforming from heirloom to moral compass through tactile specificity and causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the lens closure triggers citywide stalls, but the heiress's board intervention lacks visible tactical adaptation—agency feels slightly abrupt despite clear conceptual cost in "absence...become a ringing any ear can hear."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final image of the pen as "a small spike" reweights "orbits of regret" into actionable ethics without moralizing, avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty through embodied resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"proofreading margins grew into studying skies" reveals character through selective observation, while rhythmic control ("echoes regroup, pattering like tame rain") intensifies pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density ("subscriptions bursts and market tides" compressing industry critique), though "tame rain" slightly strains metaphor coherence in the high-pressure closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusing journalism's moral physics with celestial mechanics—the "page that never printed" transforms trope into visceral stakes, while risk-taking (lyric structure for corporate critique) heightens without obscuring clarity.</comment>
