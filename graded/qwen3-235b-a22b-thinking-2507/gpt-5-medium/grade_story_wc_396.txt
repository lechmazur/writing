<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in patience-as-method vs urgency, with embodied cost ("shadows lace me tighter"). Flaws drive stakes: keepers/fishers' mistrust compounds the shard's fragility. Secondary characters lack depth but single-POV focus justifies this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the floe-split "page turning" crystallizes cost while the "smallest synchronized movement" reconfigures options. Accumulative lens holds—pressure deepens via mirror reflections without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice floes and crystal shard constrain choices (beacon saplings prevent melting paths), charging the final image where "mirrors still spoke." Micro-setting specificity elevates: "lantern pears" and "heatless light" shape tactics while avoiding symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the mirror reconstitution deepens knowledge, forcing the amends map proposal. Cost is visceral—the floe split "like a page turning"—as options narrow from blame to shared watch shifts. Escalation feels earned, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" emerges organically from the child's story, reweighted in closure where practice "is how peace keeps." Zero moralizing; subtext in Matilde's brine-wipe and Harun's silence. Final line avoids platitudes by rooting wisdom in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "fruit that held small moons" and "floe groaning like a thing trying to sleep" reflect the peacekeeper's textured intuition. Dialogue subtext (Harun's "watch the watchers") reveals character without exposition. Rhythm modulates flawlessly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "unslept prayers" and "shadows lace me tighter" compress meaning without muddle. Every line advances atmosphere or stakes—e.g., "floe split with a sound like a page turning" charges closure. Final line’s simplicity earns resonance after dense imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "lighthouse orchard" above ice floes transforms feud tropes via beacon saplings and heatless light. Emotional specificity in "courageous anomaly" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure feels inevitable.</comment>
