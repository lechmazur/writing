<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("cautious exuberance") without embodied contradictions; the pivotal choice to seal the letter lacks visible struggle against the "impossible to quit" motive. Final transformation feels unearned despite consistent motif use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("carry smoke as witness"), but pressure escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—the library opening hinges on mystical patience rather than causal choices. Cost remains abstract, failing the proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist and watch function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices (measuring pauses with pulse, turning screws "each a degree") and charge the final image ("hidden in intervals"). Sensory details like "brittle as moth-wing" serve tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("silence hardened") is signaled early but never escalates; the protagonist adapts passively as the library "breathed back." No narrowing of options—coincidence (unwound spring corridor) resolves pressure without visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "propagation delays" reconfigure time as negotiable substance, culminating in the resonant final line ("learning when to wait") that reweights the ash-map without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in time-as-texture descriptions ("stuttered river," "quiet lightning"), with compression under pressure ("I raised the watch... began to breathe"). Minor repetition of "cyclically reversed" slightly dulls rhythm in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density with "pulse measured intervals" doing triple duty. "Propagation delays" repetition gains meaning through context, but "cyclically reversed" appears 3x without sufficient pattern-teaching payoff in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via specific mechanics ("propagation delays" as tangible negotiation), with risk-taking in making silence an active antagonist. Avoids derivative pitfalls through the ash-map’s irreversible cost ("carry smoke as witness").</comment>
