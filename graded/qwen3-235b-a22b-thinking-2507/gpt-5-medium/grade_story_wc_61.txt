<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is rich but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; micro-choices like placing the gear show value hierarchy, yet motivation remains observational rather than decision-driven under pressure. Closure's "counting again" earns endurance but misses visceral embodied conflict during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density peaks in the sonar demonstration where echoes "draw lines that approximate infinity," crystallizing Charged Poise closure with felt cost in the narrator's eternal recurrence ("counting again... because infinity is only patience"). Orientation anchored by line 3 ("I tend the nebula garden").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains every choice (ships "bruise the air," petals "curl"), while the calculating gear charges the final image as "warm" in the child's palm. Micro-setting mastery—sonar echoes become tactile "lattice" guiding sight—but avoids 9.0 by not altering tactics beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when travelers arrive: flame inheritance "breeds heirs" tested by the captain's torching confession. Pressure tightens through the sonar rain, but cost remains conceptual (generational trauma) rather than visceral; the child's "quiet shaped like yes" lacks physical consequence for her journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lamps made of stored resonance" reweighting "share light without fire"—a non-literal answer rejecting flame's hunger. Final image of "lamps pressed like seeds" crystallizes earned wisdom without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action ("spreading light one room at a time").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals fall like slow comets") modulates rhythm under pressure, but stress scenes lack syntactic compression; the narrator's voice stays uniformly ornate during ship arrivals. Patterned elision (e.g., travelers' origins) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops with exceptional density ("sonar pinging through starlit mist" doing triple duty as action/image/theme), but "moonmilk" metaphor risks preciousness. Final beat's "infinity is only patience practiced across the heart" edges toward abstraction yet redeems itself through gear's tactile warmth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes "nebula gardener" trope with sonar physics and generational trauma into fresh emotional logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes (light without fire as anti-colonial metaphor), but "calculating machine gear" echoes familiar steampunk tropes without transformative specificity.</comment>
