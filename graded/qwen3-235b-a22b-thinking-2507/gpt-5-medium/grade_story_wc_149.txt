<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in the promise ("not to wake grief") and final endurance; flaws (forgetfulness, selflessness) compound organically. The "mournful elation" beat earns closure through embodied cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "orchard learned to warm its own dark" reconfigures options with undeniable cost in "mournful elation, completing something and losing something." Accumulative lens holds through density shifts (lessons to vanishing) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains every choice (pruning strokes, ignoring trader) and charges the final image ("hung the bead in the doorway"). Recurring bead transforms from ferry to silence-summoner, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: lessons narrow options to "press and release like a vow," culminating in saplings uncurling. Cost is unmistakable in "mournful elation" and her vanishing "as a note disappears," reweighting the stake under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard's "resonant awakenings" as reply to being called, rejecting grief for action. Final image ("orchard learned to warm its own dark") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, charging prior particulars with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("glass arterial with vines," "cinders fell like confetti") remains consistent under pressure. Elision (river backstory) is taught through dialogue and pays off in the bead's function, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("quivered," "heartened"). Figurative language ("lovingly venomous," "sap was our river") maintains coherence in peak beats without muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes ghost bride trope through specific, grounded choices (ashen-veil seamstress, bead as ferry). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes via "ephemeral cameo" mechanics, transforming debt repayment into actionable legacy.</comment>
