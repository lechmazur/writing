<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor's embodied grief-fermenting nose and the ledger keeper's wax-leaf micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses (preserving vs. signaling); sister's off-page dialogue earns closure with cost in "sun snapped shut."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via Accumulative/Textural lens: "distance is not a wall but a lens" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (ephemeral connection), taught early through leaf-as-compass and cylinder grooves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waxed leaf constrains every key choice (compass attempt, cylinder reading, dusk signal) and charges the final image; "copper crow beak pointing home" evolves from scrap to resonant symbol through tactile handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: leaf's failed role as compass tightens options until the cylinder revelation; cost is legible in "sun snapped shut" ending the connection, though sister's off-page presence slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "distance is a lens" crystallizes in the final dialogue without moralizing; the leaf's transformation from childhood relic to communication tool reweights the central question organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalog a cloud by smell") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "gust sounded like a door learning to breathe" teaches the lyric pattern paid off by "minnows" in the cylinder scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "letters rose like minnows" achieves high density without muddle; "sun snapped shut" delivers closure propulsion. Minor deduction for "tinted revelations" abstraction, but redeemed by immediate concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phonograph grooves as "scars" transforming distance into tactile communication; avoids post-apocalyptic tropes through ledger keeper's sensory cataloging and the leaf's specific, irreplaceable role in the closure.</comment>
