<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself" proof moment, but Maris' borrowed voice risks over-tidiness; embodied grief in couple's "unmailed letters" grounds the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "absence washes my hands cleaner than solvent" crystallizes the cost of admitting Maris isn't his crutch, with the salvaged future tense setting reconfiguring his avoidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz grit constrains choices—swept from tympan before the final act—and the halo fragment charges the closure; "tiny static" ink makes emotion tactile while stars anchor time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the couple's grief scene where "forgiveness is a rotating mirror" forces the operator to confront his own avoidance, narrowing options to either persist in ambiguity or face his fear with visible cost in the confession proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "transposed empathy" as rotation not substitution; the final question "Will the sky forgive me..." reweights the mathematics of emotion without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "metal logic becoming breath," "crisp and patient, all margins" distills Maris into typesetting; no head-hopping despite personality borrowing, with rhythm mirroring press mechanics under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops—every line does triple duty (e.g., "topaz dust" sets atmosphere, tool constraint, and emotional charge); "rotating mirror" metaphor avoids cliché by being geometrically precise in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mechanics and emotional math avoids trope; "distance between cruelty and mercy in points and picas" feels inevitable. Risk capped by slight familiarity of grief-workshop archetype despite lyrical execution.</comment>
