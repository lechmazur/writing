<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grim optimist" and dice bias, but embodied emotion leans abstract (e.g., "texture, granular as dust" lacks visceral physicality). Micro-choices like rolling dice when air thins demonstrate stakes, yet emotional progression feels intellectualized versus raw under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dice showing seven reconfigures "perpetual motion" with conceptual cost ("walker’s number" implying endless path). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the rupture’s light as "contour, the grain of the missed" crystallizes irreplaceable stakes without resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Staircase functions as micro-setting—chalked lemmas and dice rolls constrain choices, while "gaps" that "sip warmth" charge the final image. Sensory detail (breath on mirror, humming cadence) is selective and pressure-driven, though environmental specificity rarely narrows tactical options beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—capturing "granular" missed opportunity—tightens via mathematical proofs and dice rolls, culminating in the rupture’s "contour" revelation. Cost is legible in "boundless confinement expands like a chest taking breath," where endurance forecloses escape with visceral, conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chipped dice as "bias I do not correct" rejects false perfection, while "proof says perpetual motion is a story told by finite muscles" reweights regret as fuel. Final image ("rupture seals to a thin luminous seam") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via mathematical lexicon ("lemma," "corollaries") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from clipped ("I climb") to lyrical ("light pours sideways"). No head-hopping, but rare abstraction ("sober enough to measure") slightly dilutes embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("A theorem must admit the scar that birthed it") propels momentum. Minor register drift in "perpetual motion is forbidden, says the world" risks thematic telling, yet final lines ("take seven steps, each one a kept silence") achieve crystalline resonance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical rigor and emotional longing transforms staircase tropes—dice bias as "fairness achieved by confession" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (proofs as rungs, regret as engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "chipped one holding the other like a shoulder" epitomizes fresh, irreplaceable detail.</comment>
