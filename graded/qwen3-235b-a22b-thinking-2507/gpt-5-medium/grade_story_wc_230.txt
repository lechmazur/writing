<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between rationality and hope anchors choices; micro-decisions under patrol pressure reveal values. Girl's pain lacks embodied depth, but protagonist's involuntary truthfulness drives key actions like mud camouflage with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (storm patrol sequence). Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost: "orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured" crystallizes the earned fragility of psychological safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hanging orchard actively constrains choices (rope bridge refusal, root groaning), while the glass eye functions as indispensable micro-setting charging the final image. Ravine's physicality shapes every tactical decision under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via patrol arrival forces stance crystallization; cost is unmistakable in "laughter snagged on a throat" and the girl's unresolved pain. Protagonist's truthful choices narrow options while reweighting psychological safety's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual particulars, avoiding moralizing. Final line "fractured grace is the only style" reweights prior material non-literally, with the warming eye embodying conceptual cost without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rational truffle forager" measuring fear under leaves) and rhythmic control under storm pressure. Purposeful compression (virus backstory) taught early and paid off in patrol confrontation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "laughter snagged on a throat" conveys sound, physicality, and emotional fracture simultaneously. Final image "eye grows warm" avoids cliché while recharging the motif with visceral precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms therapy tropes through specific verisimilitude (truffle forager's rationality, copper-rimmed eye). "Fractured grace" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes without obscurity.</comment>
