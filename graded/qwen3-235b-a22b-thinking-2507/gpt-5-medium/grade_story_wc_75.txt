<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when fearing "embalmer rather than nurse," but "rosewater dread" edges toward abstract label. Micro-choices like baking initials earn transformation, though the curator’s final "unworthy" reflection lacks sufficient embodied struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully when grief "thawed into apologies," reweighting the lens’s purpose with undeniable social cost. Minor softening in "waterfall seemed to bow" slightly dilutes the earned stasis of people chewing initials.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Snail-shell vents and wax molds function as micro-setting that actively constrains baking tactics and charges the final image. Waterfall’s "cold lace" affects courage but lacks physical pressure on choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when wax "would not take impressions," forcing the bread solution. The beekeeper’s off-page resolution ("drowned saving queens") risks coincidence under accumulative lens, though grief-to-apologies shift feels earned through ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges invisibly through bread crumbs in wax molds—no moralizing, just "stitched corridors." Slightly undermined by Senka’s "history needs caretakers" line, which verges on thematic echo without sufficient scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "maps went blank," "honey ran bitter." Only flaw is "felt unworthy" abstraction in climax; otherwise, rhythm modulates perfectly from "prayer beads" chambers to "edible and breakable" courage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle, but a paraphrase loop in "children kneaded, elders measured... stacked loaves" slightly dulls momentum. "Honeyed mist and memory" finale achieves crystalline propulsion with no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes museum work with flood survival uniquely—bread initials literally soften wax, avoiding quirk. "Rosewater dread" slightly echoes common poetic phrasing, but hive box rattling at climax transforms the beekeeper trope memorably.</comment>
