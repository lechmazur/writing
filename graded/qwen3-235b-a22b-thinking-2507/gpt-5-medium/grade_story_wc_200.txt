<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "modestly fearless" breath—fear as teacher when "asked to speak softly"—and the crocodile tooth's transformation from threat to mercy compass. Micro-choices under pressure (humming counter-melody, not hiding laughter's crack) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the luminous ache of memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the gorge's sigh after releasing the woman, paired with leaving "a single string for the wind" as proof of earned endurance. Accumulative lens holds—the density peak when laughter braids with the river's story reweights stakes through pattern break, not causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The misaligned harp strung across limestone actively constrains choices (plucking "a string out of line" to create crooked chuckles) and charges the final image: the gorge's sigh and abandoned string prove the setting is indispensable machinery, not backdrop. Micro-setting (tooth, harp wires) directly shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: testing the "door patiently" with crooked chuckles forces the woman's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in "bearing the luminous ache of memory like a lantern," which alters the final choice to leave the tooth—a felt tradeoff that forecloses the path of carrying it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: laughter as "key that unlocks the room you thought was a trap" resolves not in statement but in the final image of light "wearing her name until it could let her go." Avoids moralizing while reweighting sorrow as "yielding smile when it remembers the game it loved as a seed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("voices spilled from the rock: a carpenter's apology, a child's hiding giggle") with rhythmic control under pressure—short, breathless phrases during spectral confessions contrast with lyrical flow in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to tactile, embodied observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion: "I pressed the crocodile's tooth to the nearest wall and felt the ancient reptile's humor shiver through the stone" does triple duty. No figurative muddle in peak beats—the final line’s "carry it, like water in cupped hands" recharges the opening’s breath with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "soul collector" trope through specific, grounded tools (misaligned harp, crocodile tooth) and emotional truth. The gorge as voice-reservoir feels fresh, not derivative; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, as seen in the river’s story reframing the tooth as mercy compass.</comment>
