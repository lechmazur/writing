<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices like map-folding reveal hierarchy of values; grandmother's coin grounds but doesn't over-explain. Contradictory impulses (calm expertise vs storm urgency) act simultaneously in tense beats without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with Rade's violet-faced surrender; storm's cost legible in the held silence. Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to crystallized stance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices; final gate 'clattered open like a nod' charges steel's acoustic properties. Micro-setting (brass key on corrugations) shapes tactics and closure image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening through sensory escalation; Rade's surrendered authority manifests cost unmistakably. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens reweights 'whispers vs shouts' with visible relational price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass-key whispers, not moralizing; final line reweights premise without sermon. Avoids false binaries—Rade's authority loss charges complexity without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ('tasting metallic weather') persists under pressure; dialogue distinct as action. Rade's 'shadow man' vs Ivo's quiet precision modulates rhythm with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; 'origami logic' compresses meaning; final metaphor 'like a nod' avoids cliché. Sentence propulsion accelerates during courier retrieval without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustics and labyrinth navigation; risk in structural focus on method over confrontation. Avoids safety middle through specific port logic transforming 'whispers win' trope.</comment>
