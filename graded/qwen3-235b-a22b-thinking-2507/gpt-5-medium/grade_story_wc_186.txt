<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "coincidence felt less like chance than choreography" versus "coincidence as shrug," with embodied cost in "dunes shook with feet" foreclosing solitude. Lio's scars and map deepen micro-choices, though his backstory compresses slightly under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "dunes shook with feet" makes solitude's end undeniable. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, with star-path alignment crystallizing stance without causal breaks. Cost proof clear in "each arrival proof braided into breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shard of hush functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—inserted into the prism, it creates "a seam of silence" enabling the beam's "humming harmony." Pavillion ribs constrain choices via tuning mechanics, avoiding symbolic convenience through tactile action ("bones of our wrists" listening to wire).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove coincidences have meaning") tightens through accumulative pressure: traveler's arrival and star-map convergence narrow options toward the shard insertion. Cost is unmistakable in "dunes shook with feet," altering the custodian's solitary existence as people arrive, reconfiguring stakes via protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "coincidence as stitch" evolves from abstract desire to "joining that held weight" in the beam's rekindling. Final image ("pavilion sang us forward into a future that remembered our past") offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned subtext in phosphor-pouring and thistle-blown hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stories snipped by winds," "retrocognitively blessed") modulates rhythm under pressure—short sentences during shard insertion ("We trimmed... listening to mute cries") contrast lyrical peaks. Elision of collapse taught early and paid off in closure's rekindled "grammar of belonging" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion: "shard of hush, milk-pale and cool, a mineral grown where sound had once been compressed into near-stone" advances character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Peak beats ("beam did not roar; it exhaled") avoid figurative muddle, with final line recharging "diary" motif through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "coincidence as stitch" transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via specific, verifiable details (dried pear-smelling map, phosphor in lantern cup). Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes—emotional truth in Lio's attic scars avoids generic templates, making "thistle-blown hope" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
