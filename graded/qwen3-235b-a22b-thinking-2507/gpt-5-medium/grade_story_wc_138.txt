<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (boredom vs. discovery hunger) drive choices; embodied cost in "boredom had edges now" forecloses pure immortality. Lio's "face that had sworn not to forgive" avoids label-only emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with cost: "boredom had edges now" crystallizes the amulet’s shift from blood to stories. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density buildup to the corridor’s emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choice (trapezoid setup) and charges closure ("prisms flickered approval"). Sensory hierarchy (crackling pages, wound-colored grin) filters through immortal’s bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering after-goodbye) tightens via corridor emergence; cost ("boredom had edges") alters immortal’s state. Agency-driven escalation peaks when spatial mutiny "raised its quiet flag."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "departure becomes infrastructure," not moralizing. Final image (space "pacified... returned to work") reweights farewell as active process without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("angles whisper rebellion") and rhythmic control shine in "coils sang in coils." Lyric compression taught early ("hushed thunder" motif) pays off in Lio’s laughter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "wound-colored grin" and "spatial mutiny raised its quiet flag" show textural density. Final line’s cadence ("space, pacified...") avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of physics ("magnetic fields") and grief transforms "after goodbye" trope. Risk-taking (spatial mutiny as union strike) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable.</comment>
