<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "purposefully curious" tension between scientific duty and childhood loss; micro-choices like vial timing show hierarchy of values. Label-only "purposefully curious" opening slightly undermines embodiment, but redeemed by concrete action within three lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when moth ascends—"abdomen like a lantern that refuses to admit it is dying"—with undeniable conceptual cost in "hush belongs to no archive but breath." Accumulative lens holds through vial timings tightening the observation window under dawn's pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlit summit functions as active micro-setting: solar wind disables electronics (forcing chemical timers), basalt mosaic frames the snow seam, and the crater's "stillest air" enables plume signals. Final image charged by vials' "stained lip a fossil of time" against the unarchivable hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing proof before extinction) escalates through ochre vial's "five minutes" countdown, narrowing observation window. Protagonist's agency in chemical timing and shutter press drives escalation; cost crystallizes in the moth's "trembling instrument body" against satellites' "confetti" light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chemical vials vs satellite "confetti," moth's "frost on wire" song vs "numbers and noise." Final image reweights preservation—"photograph would outlast... but not the hush"—without moralizing, embodying loss through "dawning hush belongs to no archive but breath."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific precision ("basalt mosaic," "reagents that woke") with poetic restraint ("pepper of the space age," "soft-bellied tide"). Rhythm modulates under pressure: staccato during ochre countdown, flowing syntax for moth's emergence. No head-hopping; elision taught through ampoule paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story (e.g., "dew kissed them" explains chemistry while creating atmosphere). Figurative language serves function: "lantern that refuses to admit it is dying" embodies fragility without muddle. Final line's cadence crystallizes theme with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms extinction narrative through lunar-specific constraints (solar wind disabling electronics) and fresh imagery ("glacier moths slept... folded page no one had learned to read"). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently; emotional truth in "I did not cry" subverts expectation while deepening loss.</comment>
