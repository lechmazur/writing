<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in glazier's embodied craft ("hands know salt, gull cries") drives micro-choices, but boy's sudden appearance strains motivation continuity; credible endurance in "ordinary mornings were already luminous" earns visible cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pond-ring patterns; Charged Poise closure ("we will build if we also rescue...") crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("debts to wonder not settled by line item"), reweighting development vs memory via irreplaceable final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Round pond micro-setting actively constrains choices—communing ritual directly solves atrium design, charging final image ("etch on glass a map of tides"); "tender, unargued sky" embodies specificity that shapes tactics, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving memory vs development) tighten when boy's question forces articulation of "window can hold a day," but "cranes cough beyond headland" lacks sufficient escalation pressure; cost legible in "scaffolds and orange tape" yet could deepen tactical constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("debts to wonder not settled by closing time"), with final image ("dawn keeps being made out of price and freshness") offering non-literal answer to luminosity question; avoids moralizing while charging prior material through etched tide maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gossip sketches currents," "mend light") modulates rhythm under pressure; pond-ring cadence teaches pattern early, paid in closure's "circles widen and cross," with no head-hopping despite boy's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cranes cough" exemplifies textural specificity, though "tender, unargued sky" risks slight overwriting; propulsion maintained through strong verbs ("sand edges," "hum patterns") without muddying closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms artisan trope via pond-ring methodology; "voltage that hums like rain" synthesizes technical and poetic detail organically, but "before everything shifts" lacks fresh inflection—resists safety middle yet misses one bold risk to hit 9+ band.</comment>
