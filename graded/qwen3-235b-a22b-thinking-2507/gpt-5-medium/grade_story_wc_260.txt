<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in surgical precision vs. rage; "motives are a luxury" slightly over-articulated under stress but redeemed by embodied actions like hands remembering "wickednesses disguised as promises." Final renunciation of vanity earns cost through donor letter's tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: pressure builds through sensory density (invoices, phones, tail tip) not plot points. Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—"erased our vanity" forecloses grand solutions while "stillness shimmer" crystallizes endurance. No orientation debt; lens taught by "second silence" inventory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Misty workshop functions as micro-setting charging closure: atomizer mist becomes "counsel," cold glass breath enables focus. "Plastic waterfall" removal directly constrains the handler's choice to shed ornament. Final "stillness shimmer" reweights opening mist with earned cost—environment is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single deepening—"shedding layers"—forecloses path of grand solutions by removing terrarium fakes. Cost is undeniable: "angry voices asking where money went" made visceral when handler promises "small nocturnes." Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens via density (invoices, phones, tail tip) reweighting trust's fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through terrarium cleanup: "reconstruct trust not with grand bargains, but with small nocturnes" avoids moralizing. Final image of broker's brochure beside tail tip reweights "certainty is a predator" with conceptual cost—no tidy resolution, only "continued watching" as earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: handler notices "green shifting to brown with worry," not generic stress. Rhythm modulates under pressure—"I warmed the forceps, spoke, drew breath"—mirroring surgical focus. Zero head-hopping; "slow bellows" breath description embodies professional bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pale as dust" avoids cliché while "bottles painted from inside" serves dual purpose (atmosphere + crisis perception). Final line "let the stillness shimmer" recharges opening mist with propulsion. No figurative muddle—every image constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms fraud trope via chameleon's tail as emotional barometer: "curled like a question he feared answering" feels fresh. "Shedding layers" method applied to terrarium and self synthesizes premise organically. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure remains legible.</comment>
