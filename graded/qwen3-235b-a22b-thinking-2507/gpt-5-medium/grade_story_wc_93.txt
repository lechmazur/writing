<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "burning promise" remains thematic rather than driving specific choices. Brother's displacement motivates action but "gratitude that tasted like salt and iron" is the sole embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "not to be saved, but to stay awake" reconfigures stakes with herder's sacrifice as undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds through mathematical sequences tightening into a door.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains every choice: "without friction, everything yearned to flee" forces mathematical sequences to "persuade motion to become meaning," charging the final image where "numbers softened our footsteps."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens: rock sequences tightening the spiral creates narrowing options. Cost is legible in herder's "resigned grace" and eels as witnesses, though the arithmetic of mercy lacks visceral physical toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "slipping" motif → "careful craft" transformation. Final line reweights "promise" without moralizing, using tidal grammar to answer the central question of displacement with "stay awake" as resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "sea sang like wire" and "sibilant grammar of tide" reflect eel-focused POV. Minor slip in "precognitively cursed" phrasing disrupts otherwise perfect rhythmic control under rescue pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "biography of slipping" and "shy constellations" risk overwriting in high-pressure beats. "Velvet gravity" metaphor slightly violates established physical logic during dust deployment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mathematical precision and tidal mysticism transforms "rescue" trope. Risk-taking in "friction disappears" rules deepens emotional truth, with specificity ("Fibonacci arcs, perfect squares") avoiding abstraction while heightening stakes.</comment>
