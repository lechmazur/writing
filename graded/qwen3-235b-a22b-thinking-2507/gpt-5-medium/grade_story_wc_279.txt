<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority strong via chalk-as-listening-stone metaphor and embodied micro-choices (turning pebble), but contradictory impulses lack depth; motivation rooted in perceptiveness yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped during pivotal interjection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with child's "stay messy" revelation reconfiguring meaning under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost ("releasing glare") feels abstract; cost legibility falters without concrete image anchoring the price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active micro-setting: mist responds to dialogue ("ribs seemed to breathe"), tile flake constrains choices, and "lilac unease" physically charges final image ("hush rode home in breathing"), satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("discover meaning in mess") tighten via bearded man's confession, but protagonist's agency feels passive ("I had to interject"); escalation lacks visceral cost—conceptual "release of glare" insufficiently grounds trade-off in physical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: mandala's distortion into "tide map" and child's "tooth" metaphor reweight "mess" without moralizing; final image crystallizes non-literal answer to central question with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chalk is a listening stone," "lilac unease") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("whispering bowl glazed with breath") and paid off in closure's "breathing" hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("Voices began like drizzle... emergent hush gathered" avoids paraphrase loops), but "social weather changed" slightly muddles physicality; peak beats maintain density without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ritual tropes via specific, irreplaceable details ("whispering gallery tile flake," grotto's "tooth"); risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
