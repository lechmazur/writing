<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (inventive pattern-seeking vs. fear of failure) drive micro-choices like rail-tapping; embodied emotion in "chest tightens" avoids therapy-speak; final nod earns trust with visible cost in "not done paying."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "small nod that says we are not done paying" crystallizes trust's ongoing cost with harness imagery; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation ("clouds heating like a fist") to felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor constrains choices via cloud seam navigation; parachute buckle charges final image as "small metallic vow"; micro-setting (rail taps, rope feed) directly shapes tactics during docking crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation: protagonist's "tilt early" instruction narrows options under cloud anomaly; cost legible in pilot's scar and "not done paying" exchange; single tightening suffices for length with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "harness adjusted rather than dismissal" reweighting trust as labor; avoids moralizing but "watcher's burden" repetition slightly overstates; earned through concrete near-disaster and scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "listening not with ears but with careful patience"; rhythmic control during crisis ("ship shudders, then rights itself"); zero head-hopping despite crew presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor scaffold in reflection ("remembering through muscle memory is not memory at all"); high density in climax ("rope answers... give half an arm's length"); buckle's "faint click" shows strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of watchfulness as physical craft; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off; "soundless echo" transforms into tactile communication; specificity ("green-blue fog color") avoids generic tropes.</comment>
