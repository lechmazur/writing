<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "speak carefully for what cannot speak" vs scientific precision; embodied emotion via "counting breaths as the pool rises"; micro-choices during storm surge show hierarchy of values (fossil preservation over escape).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("heat map glows steady amber... mark fossil as resident not carried") carries undeniable cost of fossil's transformation; Accumulative lens holds through density build to storm surge; orientation anchored by "After humans hibernate" within 15 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cave network actively constrains choices (low shelves during rising tide, throat tunnel during surge); thermal grammar recharges final image ("dawn reddens... heat map remains warm"); "mineral hair curtain" and pool dynamics evolve causally with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice without ownership) tightens via storm surge forcing fossil relocation; agency drives escalation (wedging into tunnel, deeper niche placement); amber glow's conceptual cost (fossil as resident) charges final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fossil's evolution from token to contract; final image ("we have work... voice learns restraint") answers central question without moralizing; avoids Thematic Echo despite poetic phrasing ("flood, pause, seed...").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("rock remembers pressure, water remembers paths") filters all observation; rhythmic control shifts from meditative ("drops ring... like syllables") to urgent ("water smashes past"); no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "green vein through gray" exemplifies high-density propulsion; no figurative muddle even in peak beats ("warmth persists like a held vowel"); paragraph cuts serve visual rhythm without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific ritual and mystical negotiation; "heat-mapping emotions" transforms familiar post-human trope through specific cave thermodynamics; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
