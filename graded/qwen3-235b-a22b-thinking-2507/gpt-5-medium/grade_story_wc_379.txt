<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "discerning curator" motivation lacks embodied contradiction; Marta/Jonah scenes show community depth but curator's internal shift feels abstract despite strong neighbor vignettes. "Promised to carry them" misses micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (mailbox "convinced" open) lands with conceptual cost—developers' retreat via communal breath. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through "metronome of ache" cadence shift. Vendor's silent crying slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hibiscus shadows and mailbox seam constrain choices (loophole-tapping), charging the final image. "Sandstorm calm" evolves from "gritty hush" to "spine relaxing" breath. Over-reliance on visual metaphors slightly dilutes tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community healing vs. development) tightens via news crew intrusion. Escalation driven by protagonist's "hear first" agency; cost is visceral in vendor's "voice frayed." Developers remain underdeveloped as pressure source despite strong communal payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "open library" metaphor and locket/hairpin mechanics. Final line "we heal in the hearing" skirts thematic echo by being action-anchored. No moralizing; cost reweights "coffers thin" into communal currency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("inventory stories before objects," "porch bulb moths") with rhythmic control. "Sandstorm calm" refrain modulates tension. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "pressed pink thread" and "bottled lightning" show high density. Slight paraphrase loop in "each rib a rumor, each breath witness" deducts minimally. Final image "throttle cleared for ongoing song" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms thrift-store trope via "inventory stories before objects" lens. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation as conflict engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Measuring rooms by future laughter" synthesizes theme and setting freshly.</comment>
