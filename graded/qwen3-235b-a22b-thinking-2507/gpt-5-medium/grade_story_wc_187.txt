<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines ("preemptively nostalgic") but lacks contradictory impulses during identity crisis; lightning's intervention resolves tension too neatly without sufficient prior struggle, weakening causality for closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: quill's "heavier" weight crystallizes stance with felt cost ("anchored, not burdened"); lightning's seam to monolith provides undeniable conceptual cost, fulfilling Accumulative lens through resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (water threads sleeves with inventory) and charges final image (hearing name); observatory's fog and plinths function as micro-setting that actively shapes identity tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (sculpting identity from collective memory) deepen through shadow measurements but lack protagonist-driven escalation; lightning's pronouncement resolves tension externally rather than through earned agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (plum memory anchoring identity), avoiding moralizing; final image ("heard my name once") reweights collective memory without stating thesis, though lightning's dialogue risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("inked in weather and habit") with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure ("tape of sky consented to mark where I stood"), no head-hopping despite abstract setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "solar resin" borders on overwritten but doesn't muddle closure; final image's propulsion ("retrieved... found it heavier") achieves crystalline clarity with no artifacts dulling cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival ritual with identity quest feels inevitable; "measuring shadows to welcome them home" transforms trope through specific emotional calculus, though observatory setting edges toward familiar lyric territory.</comment>
