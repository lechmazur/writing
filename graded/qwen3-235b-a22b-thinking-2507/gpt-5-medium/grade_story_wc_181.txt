<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as curator’s bewilderment fuels agency; biting the dull fruit embodies micro-choice hierarchy with visceral cost ("pit clicked against his teeth"). Flaws compound organically—feeding the cameo rainwater directly enables the aunt’s appearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "brightened disquiet guiding him" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (orchard claiming him in return). Causal lens holds from "touch two fruits" rule to cameo’s burning impression; orientation anchors by word 25.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cameo constrains every choice—feeding it secrets, pressing it to bark—and charges the final image as an "unfinished face." Astral orchard’s rules actively pressure tactics (wrong fruit order = braided hazard), avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: choosing the "dullest fruit" narrows options, flooding him with forbidden visions. Cost is undeniable—the cameo burns and leaves its impression, altering his understanding of curation with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard mechanics, not abstraction; final line ("pages that keep writing us") reweights inheritance without moralizing. Aunt’s unfinished cameo eyes embody "possibility rather than judgment," avoiding thematic echo through concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bewildered curator by trade") infuses syntax—"rules were simply complicated, carved into basalt by earlier keepers who confused clarity with abundance." Bathroom epiphanies taught early pay off in mirror scene; zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pit clicked against his teeth" compresses sensory/action with propulsion. Final line’s rhythm ("pages that keep writing us as we read them") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Sentence variety mirrors emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope via orchard’s causal rules—effects growing causes, fruit-touching hazards. Emotional specificity in "brightened disquiet" avoids generic awe; cameo’s hunger grounds cosmic stakes in tactile detail.</comment>
