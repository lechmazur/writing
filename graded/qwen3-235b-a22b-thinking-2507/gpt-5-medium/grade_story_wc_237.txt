<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shame speaks faster than honesty" versus current ritual, but final choice lacks earned struggle escalation; crystallized ink embodies anxiety without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("lungs thunder in its cage"), but breath-holding timeframe lacks visceral escalation; drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet temporal pressure remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: tea cup constrains choice (steam-carried runes) and charges closure ("runes settle as warmth"); floating platform actively pressures tactics via tethered script and storm proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming scars) clear, but escalation lacks tightening—lightning metronome doesn't heighten physical cost until final burn; "breath between storms" concept shapes stakes theoretically but not tactically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "revisiting youthful superstitions" as active healing ("stepping through chalk doorways"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights scars as "warmth" with conceptual cost of endured pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves need to feel you listening") with rhythmic control matching ritual cadence; compression taught early pays off in closure’s lyrical density without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but adjacent "I dip... I feel" / "I breathe... I begin" creates subtle cadence loop; no figurative muddle in peak beats, density remains high during rune-drawing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tea ceremony and rune magic transforms tropes via specific lived detail (crystallizing ink as anxiety barometer); risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
