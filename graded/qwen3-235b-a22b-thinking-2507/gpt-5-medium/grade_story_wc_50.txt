<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cupped the device and listened to its wrongness" versus his trade's precision, but "store wonder" motivation lacks friction until closure; embodied emotion strong yet micro-choices under pressure feel slightly predetermined by lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly in "cavern kept one echo of his laugh, in case he forgot himself," reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, though one persistent constraint (timer fragility) remains under-tested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marble cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., "whisper seated itself precisely where he could retrieve it"), charging the final image; sensory details like "water drip, an irregular but faithful metronome" evolve causally to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting echoes) tightens through the timer's repair process, with visible cost in "failure like a beat missing in a lock's tumblers"; escalation driven by agency but "peripherally focused" trait lacks concrete tradeoffs affecting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "mechanism remembered, faithful, and within reach" reframes wonder as earned resilience; avoids moralizing while "cork cut from an old mallet" charges closure with tangible legacy, though secondary stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "sidelong glints" and "gaze stayed peripherally focused" modulates under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in "bats skirting the ceiling" cadence, with patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spring uncoiled like a memory refusing chronology" achieves high density without muddle, though "bruised orchards" slightly strains physical logic when paired with gear "bruised by grit" later in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-as-sonic-archivist transforms tropes; "nested bell with no clapper" offers specific verifiable detail, but "wounded season" timeframe lacks non-obvious emotional calculus to reach 9.0+.</comment>
