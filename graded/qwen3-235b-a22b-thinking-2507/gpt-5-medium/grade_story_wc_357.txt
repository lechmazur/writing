<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rumors say the water gathers... heart tight" and the shift from seeking a "trophy" to embracing practice. Embodied emotion ("skin prickles") avoids therapy-speak while micro-choices like fusing arrow to spindle earn the resilience epiphany through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively when planting the fused heart: "the season unknots its shoulders without breaking our weathered spines" makes the cost legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through echo density and water-flow navigation, narrowing options without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vine harness and arrow tip function as micro-setting that constrains choices (navigating when compasses wobble) and charges the final image. "Sap chooses kinder paths" demonstrates environment actively shaping tactics, meeting the 9+ gate by reweighting the orchard's relationship with resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation tightens through protagonist agency: her choice to touch arrow to resin transforms "rumors" into tangible practice. Cost crystallizes in "without breaking our weathered spines"—a visible, felt price that reconfigures the dominant stake (resilience as endurance) under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "tendrils braiding" and "sap rerouting around wounds" show resilience as adaptive practice. The final line’s "music that gathers, bends, and carries us home" reweights the entire journey without moralizing, avoiding all thematic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "rivulets peel from springs" and "shadow flows like ink" filter reality through an orchard pilot’s expertise. Rhythm modulates masterfully under pressure—fragmented phrases during inversion, lyrical cadence at the spindle—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water finds new threads, sap chooses kinder paths" achieves triple duty (action/theme/resolution). Only minor deduction for "pitted bronze gnawed by seasons and salt" slightly overwriting, but figurative language never muddles the closure beat’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the "quest for wisdom" trope through gravity-inversion physics and botany metaphors. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional impact—the spindle’s "seed heart" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative premise guards.</comment>
