<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ('warmly curious yet cautious enchantment') grounds the narrator's journey. Final choice to tend trees earns the shift from disquiet to faith, though emotional cost remains slightly oblique at 'shelved my disquiet.'</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when the shadow 'kissed the numeral for home' and 'hinge gave way,' reconfiguring 'interrupted' faith with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through bone/sundial motifs without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices (returning objects to roots) and charges closure as 'library' where disquiet is shelved. Pomegranate gnomon's physicality shapes the rebuilding climax with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure builds through bone/cataloging motifs toward the gnomon's reconstruction. Agency in rebuilding earns the shift, but the single tightening lacks visceral stakes escalation beyond emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'interrupted journeys' motif (tooth, guide's flood) without moralizing. Final circling of stele offers resonant answer: faith as ongoing interruption, not loss, charged by 'pruning interruptions so the fruit could travel.'</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('time hesitate like a held breath') modulates under pressure. Voice avoids cliché through character-particular diction ('cataloged bones like notes in a hymn'), with lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; every line advances texture ('hours lost anchor as gently as fruit falling'). Final image 'dew jeweled the sundial base' achieves high density without muddle, with rhythm varying to match emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through catacomb orchard's visceral specificity. Risk-taking lyric structure (bones as hymn notes) heightens stakes coherently, with 'orchard as library' offering non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
