<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via nerve sparks vs. choral injury, but "to understand the cost of safety" risks abstraction. Micro-choices like pocketing the bolt earn endurance, yet final renunciation lacks visceral cost escalation beyond "shorter letters."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "tears finding his snow" and "nerves wrote shorter letters" crystallize the silence's renegotiated price. Accumulative lens holds via radiator-Morse progression, though bolt's tactical impact fades post-installation slightly weakens persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt glass isn't backdrop—it actively enables the treble clef revelation and final "faint print," charging closure. Bolt functions as micro-setting that constrains the narrator's posture during nerve pain, proving indispensable to the ending's physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through radiator clicks evolving into translatable Morse, forcing the narrator's choice to "remain." But pressure stems more from environmental patterns than protagonist agency; the seventh-week countdown tightens options yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: bolt installation and breath-fogged clef reconfigure "safety's price" without moralizing. Final line—"silence remained, but it no longer asked us to forgive it"—offers resonant, non-literal resolution to the central conflict through irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in "coffee steam rising like incense for the pragmatic" and nerve sparks "blooming." Rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during clicks) avoids head-hopping; non-standard punctuation serves the accumulative lens without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frostbitten hope" evolves meaningfully across beats. Minor overwriting in "wires blooming little sparks" slightly blurs nerve pain’s immediacy, but final line’s simplicity ("no longer asked us to forgive it") delivers crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms silence tropes through tactile innovation: fogged treble clef and radiator-Morse make abstract stakes visceral. "Unpardonable silence" reframed as taxable currency feels inevitable yet fresh, with cobalt fortress specificity resisting anywhere/nowhere abstraction.</comment>
