<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira's sacrifice ("joy arrive carrying luminous regret") but "bruised with worry" edges toward stock phrasing. Micro-choices under pressure (stone placement, dream trade) earn closure with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the shadow's return crystallizes options with visible cost ("empty casing where her dreams had been"). Accumulative lens holds through reel comparisons to petal storm applause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blooming library actively constrains choices (vines tighten during reunion), with river stone charging the final image. Near-cliché "cooled embers" slightly dilutes micro-setting potency but doesn't undermine stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through reel comparisons where shadow "flinches" from owner, narrowing options to Mira's dream sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable in her "stored life she did not live" – pure Accumulative escalation under protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone trade and "luminous regret" without moralizing. Final image (library inking Mira's name) reweights prior material as non-literal answer to "preserving hope," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("listening to colors fade") and rhythmic control peak in "shadow gathered itself, taking back softness of shoulders." Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via "reels of clouded corridors."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vines tightened around the aisle where reels whirred" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final image "blossoms inked her name" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through specific rules (bottled slumber, shadow physics). Emotional truth in "luminous regret" avoids sentimentality; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
