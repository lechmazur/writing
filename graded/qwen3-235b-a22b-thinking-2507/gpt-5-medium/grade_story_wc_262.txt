<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in shelving her own life while handling relics; embodied emotion in "paper edge graze her skin, a nib of frost" avoids labels. Final choice to write "stay" earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: marking the shelf forecloses her expert distance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds via sensory accumulation to the self-realization beat where the booth "trembled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the projector’s physicality enables the psychometry ritual. Final image ("thunder... like hands learning to hold") charges closure through the tool’s evolution from "sleeping" to exhaling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening under Accumulative lens: the "rain on velvet" row narrows options to self-confrontation. Cost is unmistakable when she finds boxes stamped with her own name, altering her stance from observer to participant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through projector metaphors—unused love as "overqualified, waiting in the wings"—without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise via "hands learning to hold," offering non-literal resolution to the central question of storage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spatially imaginative... pictured as rooms") modulates under pressure; syntax compresses during revelation ("It was her own"). No head-hopping; rhythm accelerates with "doors ajar like vowels" then breathes in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "faded faces stepping toward one another" achieves textural specificity. Figurative language ("sorely used heart") clarifies rather than obscures, with propulsion sustained through the high-pressure self-realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "unused love" through projection booth metaphors—love as stage directions on film emulsion. Risk-taking heightens stakes: treating letters as "scripts for unperformed scenes" synthesizes the concept with emotional specificity.</comment>
