<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "porous" embodiment and wind-through-gate metaphor, but lacks high-stakes choice escalation; final whisper to axis feels earned yet passive for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dreams finished → teaching walls to speak); Accumulative lens holds via density increase in brass disk revelation, reconfiguring stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silo setting actively constrains choices (shelving tragedies where floor leans); "bronze quiet" sensory motif charges final pulse-image, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through brass disk revelation, narrowing options to rearranging library; conceptual cost legible in historian's palm-biting with tapestry, though escalation leans slightly passive for protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("stitch a world from echoes") resonantly answers central question without moralizing; theme emerges through tapestry/diaries particulars, avoiding abstraction or balance toggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listener to brick tone") with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure, zero head-hopping despite introspective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "dust flurries like moths" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; minor synonym loop in "half-burned diaries" repetition prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via grain-dust specificity and displaced-axis psychology; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
