<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "keeper of brightness who mistook counting for giving," but the passerby lacks sufficient development to fully test relationship dynamics under pressure; micro-choices like dabbing the tear are character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "decant, and the world adjusts to the new river," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens; "storage closet unlatch behind my ribs" crystallizes the felt price without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Camera obscura functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (breath altering images) and charges closure when "glass itself becomes a door"; viaduct's breath directly reconfigures the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's breath-driven agency ("sending portions I never spent"), narrowing options to exhale/inhale rhythm; the cost in "attic lungs" visibly shapes the decanting resolution under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "unused love stored where we resist the exhale" avoids moralizing, with the final image ("viaduct breathe easier") offering resonant non-literal answer to hoarding surplus sweetness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("breath carries different music," "pollen like golden reasons") shows character-specific noticing; rhythmic control under pressure peaks in breath-dependent image shifts without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain stitched with bell tones too small to ring" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "spiritually curious" abstraction, but immediately redeemed by concrete action ("hunting the pantry").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms camera obscura trope through breath mechanics; "unused love stored in attic lungs" synthesizes spiritual and physical with irreplaceable specificity that reweights closure without gimmickry.</comment>
