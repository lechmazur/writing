<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (philosopher's "sleep among rats" vs. practical fixer) drive the pivotal sluice repair; embodied cost in "kept the cog" after silencing narratives. No therapy-speak; flaw (reflex to lie) compounds then resolves through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silt buildup measurements create pressure that crystallizes in Charged Poise closure as water hits chalk line. Conceptual cost legible in "narratives damp as coat sleeves" and cog retention—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silt measurements constrain tactics (knee-room urgency, sluice timing); final image charged by "sleeping whales" silt humps. Micro-setting (cog, chalk) essential—salt's "index" directly enables the protagonist's stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist's silt knowledge narrowing options to "follow me or drown"; cost unmistakable in silenced arguments and dampened narratives. Dominant stake (methods vs. narratives) tightens through sediment walk toward inevitable jam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sluice repair proving "rebellion is not arson"—no moralizing. Final image ("old method stood up without asking permission") reweights preservation as quiet resistance, avoiding thematic echo via concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("salt writes its own index," "silt humps like sleeping whales") consistent under pressure. Lexicon stays character-specific ("tooth from time itself"); rhythm accelerates during sluice fix without losing philosophical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pressure kissed our shins" metaphor perfectly calibrated to POV. Every sentence propels: "I wedged the cog...wound the sluice" compresses action while maintaining causal clarity and sensory weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes: rebellion as fixing sluice gates, not violence. Fresh synthesis of preservation as moral imperative; "plague dead ledger" grounds universality in specific, verifiable detail without abstraction.</comment>
