<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I came back to fetch wisdom from failure, not to argue with shadows" versus actual shadow-confrontation; heartbeat counting embodies stress without cliché, though motivation ("fetch wisdom") remains slightly abstract despite teacup/shard anchors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via porcelain shard’s transformation ("not as a wound, but as a lens"), with irrefutable cost in "cut small for carrying"; Accumulative lens holds as ink patterns and radio static tighten toward earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal observatory and porcelain shard constrain choices (scraping eyepiece, recalibrating via ink) and charge the final image; snow’s "hush" and ink’s "black tide" reflect urgency through tactile, lived-in specificity that avoids symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s agency: spilled ink method forces micro-choices that narrow options toward defragmentation; "iron" taste and staccato pulse manifest cost, though "wisdom from failure" could feel more viscerally urgent early on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard’s evolution from wound to lens—no moralizing, only "remember what ghost you refuse to feed" implying self-forgiveness; final "wiser kind of dark" reweights failure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "snow settling like fine ash" and ink "crawling toward heat"; rhythmic control under pressure ("twenty-one, twenty-two...") avoids uniformity, with digital ghost’s voice shift ("losing my vowels") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "milky colors smoldering beneath rime" and "midnight solace" deepen texture without muddle, though "stubborn metronome" slightly risks cliché—but shard’s "fingernail moon" redeems density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics grief with domestic shards (teacup, ink); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes via ephemeral patterns, avoiding lyric detachment through concrete cost ("cut small for carrying").</comment>
