<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("forgiving skeptic") manifests in micro-choices like pocketing the tooth while doubting fae economies; Ari's shame-eroded confession reveals embodied cost without therapy-speak, though his motivation for the substitute body lacks earlier foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("ache of repairs," "limb remembered by its socket") under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via sensory density when Ari emerges, though the cleft-in-certainty concept could escalate earlier beyond thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (seam in leaves enables access) and charges closure (tooth left under fountain stone); "mint and iron" sensory hierarchy reflects bone-setter's professional bias, making environment indispensable to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. witch tales) tightens through Ari's confession and bone-setting act, narrowing options to "tell it plain"; cost is legible in the "relief of a limb remembered" as emotional trade-off, though escalation relies heavily on dialogue rather than physical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (redrawing map with "brighter ink") not moralizing; final stars-as-witnesses image reweights "mistakes into constellations" with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo while embracing moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("set more wrists than clocks") and rhythmic control during shoulder-setting ("a hush, a traction, a breath") showcase voice under pressure; minor register drift in "nervous innovation" momentarily jars the bone-setter's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density where "rings in the dentin like tree years" does triple duty (character, setting, theme); slight overwriting in "doubt is brave and memory tries on its old coats" risks muddling peak pressure but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope through medical realism (dentin rings, bone-setting mechanics); "turn mistakes into constellations" synthesizes emotional specificity with fresh metaphor, avoiding derivative safety via Ari's morally ambiguous choice.</comment>
