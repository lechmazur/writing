<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Lio's influence feels accepted rather than earned through struggle. Micro-choices during rescue (raw hands, breathing coordination) show embodied emotion but motivation remains underdeveloped despite "brambled hope" premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with nebula reveal requiring collective exhaustion, but raft transition lacks causal constraint. Cost ("tired together") is conceptual yet undeniable in final mist-rain image, though river-of-air mechanics feel slightly unearned under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet's floating arches directly pressure choices (hammock settlements, collapse crisis) and charge closure via river travel. Bell garden functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics (tethering mechanics) and recharges final image with mist-rain, avoiding decorative symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via arch collapse forces orchestrated effort with visible cost (raw hands, shared breaths), but "brambled hope" stake isn't sufficiently tested before crisis. Agency in chalk-driven adaptations earns deepening, though initial fragmentation conflict lacks proportional early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: thorns become shared seeds, bell mist becomes nebula rain. Final image reweights "brambled hope" without moralizing, with apologies traded "like seeds" crystallizing earned wisdom through action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "chalk words crooked but firm" and "wind in teeth," but collective "we" POV creates distance during high-stress rescue. Rhythmic control falters in feast scene ("shaking, crying, and laughing") with slight syntactic uniformity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in bell description ("tethered... tethered") and generic phrasing at feast scene. High density otherwise, but "shaking, crying, and laughing" exemplifies emotional scaffold that dulls rescue immediacy despite strong closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms colony tropes through specific mechanics (chalk on moss paths, breath-rowing). "Nebula of respite" avoids cliché by requiring shared exhaustion, with bell's butterfly wings becoming literal mist—a fresh synthesis where world logic drives emotional truth.</comment>
