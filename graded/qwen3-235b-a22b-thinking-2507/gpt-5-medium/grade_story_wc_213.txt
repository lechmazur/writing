<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "warm from day, cold at core" embodiment, but "credibly curious" trait remains stated not tested; Reni's pressure forces crystallization with visible cost in budget audit confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "listening had altered the storm's intention" reconfigures weather from verdict to witness while valley station's audit reminder makes institutional stakes visceral; Accumulative lens holds through solstice hush pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctuary's glass floor constrains choice (clouds below), bell rope's physicality charges climax, but "windblown sanctuary" lacks specific occupational texture; micro-setting qualifies as environment shapes tactics through ductwork river sounds and splice test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Reni's red-lattice pressure and budget audit threat; bell-pull crystallizes stance with felt cost as "restraint had been actionable data," perfectly escalating under Accumulative lens via snow's disciplined arrival reconfiguring prior fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "listening over noise" becomes "listening had altered the storm's intention" without moralizing; final bell-blessing image reweights solstice hush into active witness, avoiding thematic echo in Reni's shiver.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in "anemometer fluttered not wild but thoughtful," but microclimate jargon slightly drifts from tester's voice; rhythmic control under pressure flawless with "zero hour stepped up, not deadline but door" crystallizing tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sparrow banged once, then settled" demonstrates high density, though "microclimate variations" repeats near-clause structure; final image "shoes dry and listening sharpened" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms weather monitoring trope through specific "rope remembers hands" synthesis; snow's "discipline... in scouts" avoids cliché, but sanctuary setting leans slightly generic; risk-taking in bell-as-warning device heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
