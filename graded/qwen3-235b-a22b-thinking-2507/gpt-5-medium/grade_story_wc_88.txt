<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "paid to forget worst, not escape responsibility" and "crimes' echo," but the confession beat risks slight tell-over-show in "engineered slogans" without sufficient physical degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "cleaner hands vs. keep paddling" fork reconfigures the opening clean-slate chase with visible cost in the ledger's weight shift and "useful ache," all under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—"rings of useful ache" transforms water into embodied consequence—while the baseball's physical properties (sweating signatures, heat) constrain pivotal truth-telling choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural pressure: newspaper line readings deepen into the lake's physical demand ("pay with risk"), narrowing agency to a single, costly choice where the ball's heat forces truth with immediate consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the baseball's evolving role—from "promise bent into leather" to truth catalyst—culminating in the non-literal answer: "rings of useful ache" reframes empathy as sustained friction, avoiding moralizing while charging the final rowing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("jaded wonder draped everything like fog over neon") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in the climax ("signatures began to sweat... warmed, burned, eyes watered") avoids head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful density ("comet tail lighting underworld in patient blues"), though "delicately robust" repetition risks slight scaffold in the lake description without sufficient variation in the third instance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "clean slate" tropes through the bioluminescent lake's tangible stakes and the baseball's paradoxical physics; the risk of poetic abstraction pays off in the concrete final image of "rowing toward others, not away."</comment>
