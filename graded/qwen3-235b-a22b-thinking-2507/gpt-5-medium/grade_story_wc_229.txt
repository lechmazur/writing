<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("whispers travel farther than shouts") embodied through vial cork ritual and scent method; mentor remains underutilized secondary pressure. Final choice earned by prior causality but secondary character lacks full development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("exhausted, brittle with orders" captain; "screaming tenderness" hum). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density tightens stakes without causal breaks. Final image crystallizes reconfigured options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting: lantern glass sweat, gallery rails, and vial cork constrain choices. Dew drops as "small ears" charge closure image. Sensory selection reflects urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whispers vs shouts) signaled immediately; escalation via scent method deepens pressure. Cost legible in captain’s exhaustion and keeper’s vulnerability ("let forgiveness borrow my tongue"). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "screaming tenderness" hum and vial cork reweight "whispers travel farther" without moralizing. Final image ("gentle map of breath") offers resonant answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lantern glass sweats with dew, each drop a small ear") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from quiet ritual to humming climax. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("I steep petals... and hum"). Figurative language ("freighter sleeps like a dull knife") serves pressure without muddle. Final image ("gentle map of breath") crystallizes rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: scent navigation transforms lighthouse trope through beekeeper backstory. Emotional specificity in "ear behind ribs" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (scent over sound) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
