<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "candidly cryptic habit" versus contraband footnotes; embodied defiance via seed-rattling micro-choices. Kline’s "ants will carry only what they can lift" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "artistic rehearsal" loophole reconfigures thought-taxation with cost in officers laughing over bean-spelled ENTER. Hornworm outbreak slightly coincidental but Accumulative lens permits complication, not resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains all choices (bees for messaging, silence as mulch); gourd seed charges final image as "small planet." Calendula/consonants system shows professional specificity without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist’s agency planting "RATTLE CHOIR" as legal loophole. Cost legible when officers’ laughter cancels levy, but "thoughts taxable" pressure lacks live clock tightening—timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marigold letters and bean syntax, not statement. Final image "garden keeps the spark" resonates non-literally with gourd seed’s weight, rejecting simplistic binaries while embracing shared revolution’s fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bees muddied the taxman’s antennae" and "sweat became a second language." Rhythmic control peaks in drone-view planting sequence; no head-hopping despite Kline’s dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "warp the space between thoughts" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "converging chaos of too many rehearsed silences" slightly dulls hornworm scene’s immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope through gardening-as-linguistics; emotional truth in "laughing they performed an intention." Risk-taking (tax law as planting pattern) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by Charged Poise ending.</comment>
