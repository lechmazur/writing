<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "dynamically observant" fiddler who both disbelieves yet plays for "pixelated amnesty"; final choice to sculpt possibility from "never" earns visible cost via impossible warmth of contact. Hitchhiker's opaque motives slightly undercut relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable conceptual cost: "warmth where his arm meets mine" defies accounting, crystallizing the ledger's closure. Accumulative lens holds through scaffold map density building to river reflection, reweighting stakes via physical impossibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (scaffold wrap, glass flake) constrains choices and charges finale: river light pixelates reflection into "witness with missing squares," then clarifies the flake. Environment actively shapes tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: scaffold map discovery tightens options toward playing "the measure that forgives." Cost crystallizes in the ledger's "receipt" as impossible physical contact, legible under accumulative lens without causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pixelated amnesty" reweights via glass flake's clarification, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("ledger closes, if only until another crossing") offers resonant answer to debt/possibility without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("luminous disbelief braids through bow hair") and rhythmic control under pressure ("recount the two coffees...") define voice. Elision taught early (hitchhiker's vanishing) pays off in scaffold map revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "emulsion peeling like a moon shedding languages" slightly strains but justified by voice. Final line achieves crystalline density: "ledger closes, if only until another crossing" recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing hitchhiker trope through photographic conceits ("pixelated amnesty," wet-plate flake). Emotional specificity in "sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'" avoids generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
