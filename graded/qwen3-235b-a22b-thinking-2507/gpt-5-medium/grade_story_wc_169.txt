<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "logical dreamer" pursuing hope through math while embodying it via sea glass patterns; embodied cost in village's sleepwalking state forecloses magical thinking without sentimental payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost: "stars seemed lower" crystallizes the shift from abstract hope to choreographed action, with the gauge's "held breath" posture reweighting the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto setting constrains every choice—the tide's "finger-width" climb tests patterns, while the gauge's salt-mottled face charges the final image; sea glass isn't decoration but tactical ballast for hope's equation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern density: needle tremors narrow communication options until the gauge's "steady angle" forces trade-off—abandoning solitary calibration for communal choreography, paid via the village's transformed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects: hope's "buoyancy and ballast" equation reweights the opening storm's devastation into "windows strung with sea glass," avoiding moralizing via the gauge's silent metronome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature is immaculate—"needle making a hush of steps," "tide climbed like a careful idea"—with rhythmic control tightening during cross-timeline exchanges; no head-hopping despite multiple selves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; each line propels: "released the small sphere toward the moon's throat" compresses action/image without muddle. Only minor cadence stiffness in "recalibrate our days" phrase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "parallel selves" trope via mathematical intimacy—the gauge's "etiquette" turns metaphysics into tactile physics, with "serene upheaval" reframing hope as communal choreography rather than individual triumph.</comment>
