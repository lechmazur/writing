<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the heretical key use versus foreman's methods; embodied emotion via blood-timing on knuckle earns closure. Epiphany slightly unmoored from Basin Three lag escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "razor edges where one state cuts into another" reweights time's nature with blood-cost on the key. Accumulative lens holds through Basin Three investigation to final boundary event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fjord actively constrains choices (salt dissolving echoes, seaborn pulse), while razor-edged gauges directly cause the blood-cost climax. Basin Three's lag charges the closure image as environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Basin Three's lag—protagonist's agency in counting backwards reveals "hidden teeth," foreclosing correction with visible blood-cost. Deepening exceeds mere observation via micro-choice to leave the "error."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gauge nicks become time's "severance" without moralizing. Final image ("exactly placed at the edge") resonates as non-literal answer to "what clocks measure," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("needles bright as gull bones," "fjord quiet deepened") is character-specific; rhythmic control shifts from measured to fragmented during crisis. Zero head-hopping, with elision (grandmother backstory) taught and paid off via key.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "nick on razor edge, bright bloom that timed itself" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. One borderline academic phrase ("conceptual or social cost") slightly dulls blood-timing moment but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-measurement trope through hydraulic specificity and "razor edges" synthesis. Emotional truth in blood-timing moment avoids cliché; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
