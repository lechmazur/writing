<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through cloud-emotion taxonomy driving navigation choices; embodied grief ("drafty corridor smelling of engine oil") avoids therapy-speak. Slight over-reliance on father backstory edges toward summarization but redeemed by log-entry micro-choice at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: atmospheric pressure builds through evolving cloud emotions that directly inform navigation tactics. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "blank lines where the sky remembered for us"—the proof exists but remains scientifically illegible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Brass telescope functions as micro-setting: father's tool constrains choices (starlight projection guides coordinates) and charges final image ("set telescope on cradle"). Salt flats/gondola actively pressure tactics via "spooled wholeness" navigation logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: "bearing ninety toward acceptance" proves emotional taxonomy directly alters survival tactics. Cost is visceral in log's "blank lines"—the proof exists but cannot be validated, sacrificing scientific credibility for truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: log's blank lines reconfigure "empty spaces remember" as archival absence rather than sentimental platitude. Final image ("spooled wholeness gathers wandering hours") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("moods that moved like migrating lanterns") and rhythmic control under pressure ("pop of static... hush generous as cathedral") remain consistent. Radio dialogue achieves indirection ("clouds have forgiven us") while advancing plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks ("squall line creeps like a librarian shelving storms" conveys threat and narrator's profession). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting—"spooled wholeness gathers wandering hours" charges closure image perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms meteorology tropes via emotional cloud taxonomy that literally guides navigation. Risk-taking ("atmosphere is a city of feelings") heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("cinnamon tea" scent in grief) avoids abstraction.</comment>
