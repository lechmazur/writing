<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied micro-choices (e.g., cataloging fear in shifting alphabets), but POV character's motivation lacks the contradictory impulses required for 9.0 despite strong vulnerability encryption theme. Mara's dance-driven communication avoids stock traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when water withdraws from cabinets—names leaning "like seedlings toward light" crystallizes cost through barometric weight. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; disorientation (sunken lab) pays off in silt-sketched solutions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hangman's dice constrain choices (dictating pen hesitation) and charge the closure with "bones on bone" clicks. Flooded tiles and corrosion-etched journals evolve causally, mirroring pressure-to-stone transformation of memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the Warden's blue pulse forcing a waltz evasion, narrowing options to coded hesitation. Agency-driven escalation peaks when doubt opens vents—a felt cost in the "barometric weight" of liberated names leaning toward them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "encrypt vulnerability as strength" manifests in silt-crescent alphabets and hesitation-as-cipher. Final image of voices crossing spider-strands offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("rust sighed," "water into an accomplice"), but rhythmic control slightly falters during high-pressure beats with uniform lyrical cadence. No head-hopping; POV consistency anchors the dance-as-language.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "puckered like fingertips, ink standing up like hair" exemplifies high-density texture. Final "knot deciding it had been a bow" delivers propulsion without muddle—closure image crystallizes earned exhaustion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms heist tropes via dance-as-cipher and dice-remembering-hesitation. Specificity ("rib bones," "crescent" silt) avoids quirkiness; the sunken lab’s "archival lungs" reconfigures memory captivity with conceptual freshness.</comment>
