<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ada's grief embodied through locket-tapping and whisper; therapist's "softly adaptive" trait shown in shifting song to match her rhythm. Final micro-choice (whispering "wondering is love") earns quiet endurance. Slight underdevelopment in Ada's internal conflict beyond reactivity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Ada tracing locket curve crystallizes grief's reconfiguration with visible cost ("thin relief crossed her forehead"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density builds to eclipse totality. Orientation flawless by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket on guitar body) constrains choice and charges final image—humming memory with strings. Sage Ridge's "dreaming roots" and dust-scented ground pressure choices. Minor overwriting in "ravens wrote cursive" slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake (can music bridge grief?) tightens via therapist's agency: matching Ada's tapping creates "a line form," placing locket on guitar alters tactics. Cost legible in her "whisper" voice and "ticking" locket. Escalation driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: socks-turned-right, bullfinch, locket's wheat-color curl. Final image ("wondering is love") reweights "ordinary magic" without moralizing. Slight tell in "lifelong wonder" line reduces earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musical syntax ("thumb drape notes," "wind take over tempo"). Compression under eclipse pressure feels authentic. Verbatim repetition of "cautious exuberance" at end slightly undermines rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("moon bit into sun like patient moth"). "Drape notes one by one" slightly muddles metaphor (drape implies flow, "one by one" discrete). No closure impact—propulsion flawless through final chord revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms eclipse tropes via music therapy lens: locket-humming physics feels fresh. Emotional specificity in grief—not resolved but "steadier." Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; avoids safety-middle. Slightly familiar "grief through object" trope prevents 9.5+.</comment>
