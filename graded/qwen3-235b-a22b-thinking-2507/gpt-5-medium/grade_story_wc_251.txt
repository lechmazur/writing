<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "humble rebellion" vs. chess coach identity, but "hears unspoken words" lacks concrete embodiment under pressure; boy's whispered nothing earns change without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with "live with next moves unfinished," cost legible in mason's suspended trowel; Accumulative lens clear by midpoint with window displays deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt library mist and magnetic grotto constrain choice (failed compasses) and charge final image; quarry's iron veins enable the thematic "needles hold still" payoff with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through synchronized displays tightening options toward deliberate stalemate; cost crystallizes in mortar's patience, though "hush where past meets prophecy" lacks concrete pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "refusal to decide" chess play reweighting "forests of second thoughts" without moralizing; final image of leaves promising shade offers resonant non-literal answer to haste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fingers trembling above choices like needles over true north"; rhythmic control under pressure ("mist curled like quiet music") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density in "library walls drank our breath like paper drinks light"; minor figurative muddle in "rain beginning" avoids closure impact but caps at 8.7.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy as "long listening" transforms rebellion trope; specific magnetic grotto reconfiguration avoids derivative haste themes while risking lyric structure that heightens coherence.</comment>
