<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grips reality loosely/clutches at echoes," but Erland's rope wisdom edges toward thematic echo; "frostbitten plans" lacks embodied specificity to elevate fully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "asked for another delay" crystallizes refusal of scheduled death, reweighted by "wind on their line translating me to permission"—perfect Accumulative/Textural lens execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as living constraint: buoy snap forces evacuation, ice taps locate hollows for rescue; final "margin of mercy" recharges setting as active teacher of endings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning sound of endings without surrender) tightens through child rescue; cost is visceral in "eyes dilated like moons," but clinic call resolution slightly softens escalation's peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "rope remembering where not to strain" becomes embodied wisdom; final "sound of endings arriving and passing" answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless—"water answers in old vowels," "handwriting of gulls"—but Erland's "living is refusing an ending" risks thematic echo; voice modulates perfectly under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "knuckles/boats" and "rope slacking" show crystalline propulsion. Minor deduction for "frostbitten plans" (near-cliché) in high-pressure rescue beat, slightly muddying momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia trope through ice marina's sonic logic; "saluting someone still arriving" synthesizes risk-taking with emotional specificity—fresh inflection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
