<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("irreverent as a saint," denying tears while measuring silence) drive the final chalk-mark choice with embodied cost; motivation rooted in "yearning algorithm" compels higher-stakes trials without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell's "beginning" beyond sound reconfigures options with visible cost (denied tears, restless algorithm), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation clear by word 15 with functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Acid sea and workshop function as micro-setting: "yearning was the only motor that started in acid air" constrains tactics, while kaleidoscope shards charge closure through "tessellated commandments" reprise in grease-pencil code.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes intensify through Ilex's agency-driven adjustments (kaleidoscope twists, ratio translations), narrowing options to the final trial; cost is unmistakable in denied tears and the algorithm's "not satisfied" hum against the brightened sea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete struggle: "some bells ring in readiness so the future has a north" reweights the premise without moralizing; final image of steam lifting him offers resonant answer to "ringing the unheard" through earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sails like eyelids" and "acid wind applauded"; rhythmic control under pressure ("stuck out his tongue at the universe") with taught compression ("first trial was sideways") avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels ("forged the arrow tip into a switch"), with figurative language serving purpose ("shards of rusted sky became tessellated commandments") and final line resolving through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "yearning algorithm" from trope into emotional machinery; fresh synthesis of "bell no one hears yet" with acid-sea physics feels inevitable, with risk-taking (mechanical longing) heightening stakes without obscurity.</comment>
