<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("command clung like damp clothes") and embodied emotion ("crisped to a memory of wind") earn the renunciation; boy interaction shows micro-choices but secondary pressure remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through patterned sensory escalation; Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "stepping aside" at the jasmine-hop treaty—visible price paid in Mara's reconstructed order.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Linden leaf and trellis function as micro-settings that constrain choices (rebuilding shelves) and charge the final image; "soil bright with possibilities" slightly edges toward cliché but redeemed by later specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via weather pressure narrows options to release/control binary; cost legible in "knots sighed loose" and shelf reconstruction futility, though internal conflict resolves a hair too neatly for maximum tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through plant behaviors ("treaty" not "tangle"), avoiding moralizing; "care as subtraction" insight earned by jasmine-hop reconfiguration, though "reluctant metamorphosis" label slightly undermines subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("droplets clung like second thoughts"); rhythmic control mirrors storm cadence; circuitous sincerity motif weaves through voice without therapy-speak, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "veined like a map of untraveled roads" risks familiarity but saved by context; no closure-dulling artifacts, though "bright with possibilities" slightly over-ornaments early momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical observation and surrender ethos; "plants working out their own calculus" transforms nursery tropes, though "listening to roots" edges near cliché without full transformation.</comment>
