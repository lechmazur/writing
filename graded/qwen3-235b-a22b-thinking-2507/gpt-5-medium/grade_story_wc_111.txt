<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mended deception scene: "why I had lied, and why I had not lied entirely" embodies embodied moral ambiguity without therapy-speak. Micro-choices like soil offering reveal hierarchy of values, though secondary pressure absence caps depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure as vine's leaf presses dial to "enough," crystallizing cost in "accepting leaves that chose ground." But disorientation penalty applies: no temporal anchor by 120 words ("after luck becomes measurable" lacks concrete when).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (marbles, dials) constrains choices via "polish the least shattered one" ritual, charging closure when set as "planets" around fountain. However, orientation penalty from Q2 caps score; spatial choreography lacks precision in maze transitions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: mended deception confrontation forces stance crystallization with cost ("bones quiet as twigs" kneeling). Escalation driven by garden's pressure, but timeframe element fails to act as live clock narrowing options as required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fortune is a mirror" gains resonance via marbles' scars aligning with "constellations of stubborn care." Avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in vine's action, though "gardeners are light" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dials ticked like timid beetles" and "hedges hissed." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("bones quiet as twigs"), with patterned elision (drought backstory) taught early and paid off in deception scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops but "luck's needles steadied to a calm percentage" suffers register drift (mechanical "needles" clashing with organic voice). High density overall, though "silver breath" metaphor slightly muddles fountain's physicality in critical beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: measurable luck refracted through gardening pragmatism ("counting leaves and debts with same slow thumb"). Fresh inflection in marbles as "witnesses" not prizes, transforming trope through specific stakes. Avoids abstraction with "cracked along a seam like a smile."</comment>
