<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but internal conflict lacks contradictory teeth; "latent sacrifice" embodies cost yet "learned to travel as a patient frequency" risks diagnostic abstraction. Final renunciation earned but cost ("thin herself") under-dramatized at pivotal weave.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (delayed who/where anchors) triggers -0.4 penalty, capping Q3. Closure (charged poise: "debt paid in quiet") lands with conceptual cost but lens ambiguity at midpoint (-0.3) undermines escalation clarity despite strong accumulative density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped per cross-cap due to Q2 orientation penalty. Bamboo/orchard details vivid yet postcard-like; micro-setting (loom mechanics) charges closure but "dead river" journey lacks tactical pressure. Environmental constraint only partially shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("impossible distance") deepen texturally through weaving choices, but escalation lacks visible price charging final image—Kio's "thinning" implied not dramatized. Agency strong yet cost ("less remaining") feels conceptual rather than embodied at closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "raveling silence" → "rope" motif; final image ("waiting for morning") resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "patient frequency" abstraction slightly dilutes earned ambiguity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cloth thinking," loom-centric sensory bias) with rhythmic control under pressure. Zero head-hopping; non-standard grammar ("rain stories") taught early and paid off. Near-flawless voice modulation from wistful to stilled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "amber bead clicked... constellated oath" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor -0.2 for "latent sacrifice" abstraction in high-pressure beat, but no figurative muddle. Final line ("waiting for morning") recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw edges as navigational tool transforms trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without confusion; "frogs kept a lighthouse" avoids cliché. Emotional specificity ("taste of rain from tin bowl") anchors universals.</comment>
