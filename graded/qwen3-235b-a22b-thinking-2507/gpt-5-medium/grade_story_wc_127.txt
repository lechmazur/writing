<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: letting Rhea take the petal balances professional detachment with rare witness-desire. No label-speak; "nerves bright enough sleeves crackled" concretely reveals her state under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "eyes were steady, future learned to walk beside others" crystallizes the cost of temporary counterfeit with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens options toward this earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Amber grotto functions as essential micro-setting: resin breath and static directly constrain communication ("serving as braille between pulses"), charging the final fossils image that reweights transformation. Every detail pressures choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Rhea’s agency: her reaching for the petal ("trade works only when shared") forecloses pure data or longing, with visible cost in "humane arithmetic" balancing herd survival against map honesty under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "half truths" as migration paths reconfigure truth as "motion gathering seeds in fur," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("herd will taste you arriving") resonates without stating the central question’s answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature dominates: "resin breath raised stray hairs," "static as braille" filter all observation. Rhythm modulates from clinical precision ("recipe numbered for order") to lyrical compression under stress ("a little fox of static"). Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose multiplies meaning ("petal curled as if satisfied with humane arithmetic"). Figurative language ("aldehydes tapped at archived maps") remains precise in peak beats without muddling closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms healer trope through specific mechanics: counterfeit emotions as numbered recipes, static as communication medium. Emotional truth in "affectionate detachment" avoids generic templates, with the herd’s faith walking into dust feeling freshly inevitable.</comment>
