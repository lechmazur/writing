<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between honoring fragility and building impermanent signals is embodied through tactile actions, but motivation to "honor overlooked histories" remains abstractly stated without concrete trade-offs or visible cost escalation under monarch scarcity pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (monarchs' absence as societal silence), but the Accumulative/Textural lens isn't explicitly anchored early; subtle pressure escalation via sensory density lacks one clear "meaningful tightening" beat that narrows options under grotto's unsettled rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's moss, vines, and moth wing actively constrain choices—spiral construction uses physical materials to charge the final image, with environmental details (sunlight, shadows) evolving causally through Elara's actions to mirror her emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vanishing beauty) tightens via monarch scarcity, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the "uninterrupted cadence" pressure manifests as environmental observation rather than forcing Elara's tangible tactical shift or visible loss beyond emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through moth-wing symbolism and temporary structures, avoiding moralizing, but the final "stories to be told" line edges toward thematic echo, nearly violating Q5's penalty for overt resonance in closure without sufficient concrete reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in vine-filtered light and wind-whispered rhythms, with syntactic cadence modulating under pressure (e.g., fragmented phrasing during humming), though "esoteric realist" label momentarily disrupts POV modesty by over-articulating self-awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels in sensory verbs ("sunlight filtered," "hum of unseen things"), but paraphrase loops ("transiently rooted"/"transient beauty") and elevated diction ("blushing stillness") in high-pressure beats trigger minor scaffold deductions despite otherwise clean rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief through tactile signal-building feels inevitable, with grotto setting transforming monarch migration tropes; however, the "interrupted cadence" concept leans slightly on familiar eco-lament frameworks without fully transcending them through unique moral calculus.</comment>
