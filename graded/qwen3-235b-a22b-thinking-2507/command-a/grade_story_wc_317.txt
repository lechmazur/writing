<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation (safeguarding innovation) but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "notably receptive" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs. Final choice to enter chamber lacks earned cost or renunciation, undermining closure causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: "nocturnal haven" remains spatially vague past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff. Closure (discovering artifacts) lacks visible cost—Elias's seamless acceptance undercuts Earned Stasis despite coherent causal lens (seed→key→door).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Brook setting pressures choices only at climax (key dropped in water), but early vagueness ("nocturnal haven") triggers Q2 orientation penalty. Micro-setting (key) charges final image, yet storm/silence motifs feel decorative until late payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) signals early but faces no escalation—mystery deepens without narrowing Elias's options or imposing cost. Brook's flow resolves the problem it didn't create, violating causality under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme ("safeguarding spaces for innovation") emerges organically through planting ritual, but final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("This was his purpose") triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty, replacing earned resonance with stated purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (puzzle-solver's analytical gaze) shines in "orthogonal approaches" phrasing, but POV slippage occurs in omniscient lines like "as though it carried a weight beyond its fragile shell," diluting interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control ("brook murmured softly, its flow steady and hypnotic") with zero scaffold loops, though "storm-born silence" repetition risks thematic echo. Minor register drift ("orthogonal approaches") clashes with proprietor's lexicon in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Corpse flower seed offers fresh inflection, but core "mysterious object unlocks secret" trope remains underdeveloped. Escape room proprietor angle lacks transformation—could swap protagonist without altering emotional arc, failing proximity check.</comment>
