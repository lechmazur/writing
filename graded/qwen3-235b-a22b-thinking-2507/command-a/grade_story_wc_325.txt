<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows claustrophobia's physical grip ("walls seemed to close in") and contradictory impulses (fear vs promise to Voss), but transformation to calm happens too abruptly after vision without sufficient struggle in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with visible cost (psychological shift in claustrophobia), but phase transition mechanics lack causal setup—fleck's travel function emerges abruptly without prior logic, weakening escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices: tidal water blocks paths early then becomes escape route, and "crashing hush" evolves from oppressive to promising, charging the final image with concrete cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens (claustrophobia → blocked vault → phase shift), but Dr. Voss's "not meant to control" warning lacks visceral immediacy; cost is internal but not sufficiently dramatized during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the final image ("some things meant to remain invisible"), avoiding moralizing, though "crashing hush now sounded like a promise" edges toward sentimentality without deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with panic-driven fragments ("Her headlamp flickered") and lyrical vision prose, but "crashing hush" repetition feels tic-like and "unremembered" phrasing lacks character-specific idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythm variation and propulsion, though minor paraphrase loops exist ("crumbling walls" repeated closely) and "fleck" overuse slightly dulls density in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking and cosmic horror elevates tropes (cables as "veins"), but mentor-vanished motivation feels familiar; risk-taking in phase vision heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
