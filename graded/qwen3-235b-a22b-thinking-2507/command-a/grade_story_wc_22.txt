<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but interiority lacks embodied struggle. "Heart heavy with memories... spark of possibility" reads as abstract label-speak without micro-choices under pressure, violating emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "narrow vastness" reweighted in final image with felt cost ("heart heavy... spark of possibility"). Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks meaningful density shift—steady accumulation without pattern break weakens pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (kneeling on graying wood) and charges closure ("testament to his vision"). Sensory details like "scent of salt and decay" anchor urgency, though "narrow vastness" repetition borders on thematic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing land) signaled early but remains abstract—no concrete test of commitment. Pressure never tightens; bird calls guide without opposition. Cost ("heavy memories") is emotional but not dramatized through action, failing to alter tactics as required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seed-pod imagery but collapses in final paragraph with explicit moralizing ("it was not the size... but depth of intention"), triggering -0.7 Thematic Echo penalty. Resonant final image lacks meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers brushing soil, felt pulse of life") and rhythmic control shine. Voice modulates from twilight gloom to hope without POV leakage, though "spark of possibility" slightly undermines embodied specificity under low-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but overwriting in high-density beats ("shadows that danced like ghosts across the jetty") triggers -0.4 density penalty. "Narrow vastness" repetition in final third creates paraphrase loop (-0.3), dulling closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "gloom-hill coachman" archetype with bird-call method feels inevitable. Emotional truth in quiet persistence elevates tropes, but "submerged concord" lacks conceptual novelty—transformation insufficient to avoid mid-band hedging.</comment>
