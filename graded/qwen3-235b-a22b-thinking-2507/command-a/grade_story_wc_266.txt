<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs. courage) drives the ticket-punch climax with embodied cost, but "weight of footsteps in the air" leans abstract. Ferryman's thin characterization limits relationship-as-crucible depth despite functional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (leash gone, courage internalized), but the ferryman's reappearance feels coincidental rather than earned. Cost proof falters—no exact line crystallizes the price paid during the air punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ticket punch constrains choice (Mara must use it) and charges the final image; mist actively shapes traversal. "Veiled ridgeway" functions as micro-setting by forcing slow, deliberate steps that embody the thematic "traverse."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (finding unused courage) tighten through Mara's ascent, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ridgeway "guides" her. Ferryman resolves the climax, violating the "no coincidence" rule; cost is felt but not unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ticket punch's evolving meaning without moralizing; "the traverse" reweights the journey in the final image. Avoids thematic echo, though "vigil" is slightly over-explained in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gauzy light," "salt and secrets") and rhythmic control shine, but ferryman's dialogue lacks voice differentiation—he echoes Mara's lexicon. No head-hopping; compression serves the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed ticket edges" shows instead of tells. Slight overwriting in "twilight draped the veiled ridgeway" risks decorative density, but closure beat remains clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ferryman as future self transforms trope through specific mechanics (star stamp transfer). Risk-taking heightens stakes, though "leash" metaphor borders on cliché. Emotional truth anchors the abstract premise.</comment>
