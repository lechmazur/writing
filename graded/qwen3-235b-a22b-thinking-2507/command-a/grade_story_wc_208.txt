<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("scaffold complexity") remains abstractly told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure; Mara's flawless competence lacks genuine struggle or visible tradeoffs. Diagnostic label "turbine-hum reverie" appears in peak beats without showing degraded cognition under stress. Closure's "profound sense of purpose" asserts rather than dramatizes cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds early, but Accumulative/Textural lens falters at climax: Mara's passivity ("stepped forward," "approached") makes pressure feel coincidental rather than earned. Critical failure: no legible cost in closure beat—the "profound purpose" assertion lacks felt price despite Charged Poise framework. Cost proof test fails; cannot point to on-page consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity (salt scent, calloused hands) anchors early, but archway/chamber function as atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices. Micro-setting potential of lantern slide is underutilized—its physical handling never alters tactics. Final image lacks environmental constraint; driftwood sculptures mentioned but inactive in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding slide's secret) tightens via sensory escalation (pulsing light, hidden passage), but pressure isn't Mara-driven—storm "stills as if holding its breath," chamber "erupts" without her agency. Cost remains abstract ("profound purpose") rather than visible forfeiture; no tangible price (time/tool/stamina) alters her tactics or charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through slide patterns and driftwood artistry until final paragraph's moralizing: "keeper of timewoven alliances" explicitly states the thesis, violating organic emergence. Thematic echo in closing lines ("carry this legacy forward") replaces earned resonance with sermonizing, triggering -0.7 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV voice shows strong perceptual signature ("calloused yet nimble," "turbine-hum reverie") but suffers register drift—"scaffold complexity with simplicity" sounds like corporate jargon in interiority. Under peak stress (chamber reveal), syntax remains uniformly elevated without rhythmic compression; psychic distance inconsistently shifts between deep and distant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken climax: "patterns merging into single image" followed by "map of ideas" restates without added pressure. Final paragraph exhibits overwriting ("storm now distant memory... enriched by wisdom") with template cadence ("She knew... but felt..."). Artifacts in final third (-0.7) disallow 9+ and dull closure's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" offers fresh conceptual framing, but GPS failure trope adds generic urgency without transformation. Emotional truth in artistic obsession is undermined by safety-hedging—Mara's flawless execution lacks risk. Transformation test fails: swap "driftwood sculptor" for "painter" and plot remains unchanged, revealing insufficient specificity.</comment>
