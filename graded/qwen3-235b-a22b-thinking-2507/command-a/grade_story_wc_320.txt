<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks depth; "realized her mistake" feels unearned without struggle. Flawed competence shown via discarded assumptions, but emotional progression remains tidy without visceral embodiment during pivotal shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "silence was not absence" crystallizes cost through relinquished assumptions. Lunar perigee timing provides causal pressure, but Earned Stasis lacks tangible forfeiture beyond epistemological shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Towers function as micro-setting constraining choices via tuning dials, charging the final image. Gorge remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics; specificity anchors the cosmic theme through concrete console interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through discarded assumptions narrowing options, but "finite power" error resolves too cleanly. Lunar perigee creates live-clock pressure, yet cost remains conceptual without visceral forfeiture scaling to closure's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shard's evolution from "relic" to "promise," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "beginning in every ending" as process, but secondary stake ("city reborn") dilutes focus without sufficient interweaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "static coalesced into melody" synesthesia. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though "serenely electric" repetition risks lyric redundancy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic propulsion ("skeletal fingers... holding its breath"), but "faintly... faintly" synonym loop in para 2 dulls immediacy. Final image avoids overwriting while crystallizing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic tropes through specific "shard of hush" mechanics and radio-tower pragmatism. Emotional truth in "silence as possibility" feels inevitable, though lunar perigee device borders on familiar without deeper reinvention.</comment>
