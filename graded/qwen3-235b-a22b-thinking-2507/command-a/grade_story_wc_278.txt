<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands steady yet weary" and guilt-driven tattooing, but firmware's sudden softening lacks causal link to her turmoil, creating a motivation gap at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with "meteor hush" reconfiguration; cost legible in "hands no longer steady but free," though firmware shift slightly strains accumulative logic by coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber constrains choices early (freedom contemplation) and charges closure (brighter glow = peace), while lab's "folding time" directly enables letter-writing mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via letter discovery → writing → sealing sequence, but firmware's transition from "roar" to "mournful melody" lacks visible struggle, softening agency at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "meteor hush" answers guilt without moralizing, while amber's reprise reweights freedom from trap to peace via earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("whispers of forgotten melodies"), but "relentless reminder of her failure" uses label-speak, violating embodied emotion during high-pressure reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control soars in "labyrinth of glass chambers," though "doomed from the moment it brushed against the sticky resin" suffers template cadence with three prepositional phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of firmware guilt and constellation storytelling feels inevitable; meteor hush transforms "dissonance" trope through specific, charged imagery without abstraction.</comment>
