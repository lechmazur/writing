<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliard’s embodied persistence shines when scrubbing rust with seawater/sand, but "earnestly naive" lacks contradictory impulses; his unwavering hope avoids genuine struggle with the bell’s fragility, diluting earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with waves returning and bell’s scarred weight, but "dripping rates" method feels under-motivated; cosmic imbalance resolution lacks visceral cost escalation despite visible scar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct’s dew-dripping rhythm actively constrains Eliard’s actions (e.g., humming melody guides reassembly), and the bell’s scar charges the final image; micro-setting elevates beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as bell reassembly progresses, but cosmic imbalance resolution relies on near-coincidence (waves returning); Eliard’s agency drives the repair, yet the cost (ongoing work) feels abstract versus tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" motif reweights meaning through the bell’s scarred reassembly, but thematic resonance is undercut by the final paragraph’s near-moralizing ("more than an object... symbol of what could be restored").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dew dripped from spires at precise intervals" and rhythmic control during repair; however, "plausible impossibility" label intrudes with diagnostic tone during high-pressure reassembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"He closed his eyes, focusing on the dripping rates, feeling the rhythm seep into his veins" exhibits scaffold loops; "plausible impossibility" diction clashes with mage’s lexicon, dulling propulsion in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic stakes via mundane bell repair feels inevitable, but "last fish caught" premise leans on familiar eco-parable tropes without transformative specificity in the imbalance’s mechanics.</comment>
