<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("nurture lifelong wonder") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; Finn's fear/fascination shows embodied emotion yet shifts too neatly to "cautious exuberance" without messy internal conflict. Diagnostic phrase "spark of wonder" triggers -0.4 penalty for label-only feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds: Finn's dormant wonder activates with visible cost ("purpose had shifted"), reconfiguring magic through CR. Accumulative lens holds via eclipse progression, but keepsake glow risks magical convenience without sufficient character-bound perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: "dreaming roots" ground temporal pressure, while the keepsake curl charges closure by evolving from relic to symbol. "Glowing grass" slightly strains physical logic but serves the Accumulative lens' sensory accumulation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear vs wonder) tightens through eclipse deepening, narrowing Finn's options as telescope becomes obsolete. Cost is felt in his "shift" but lacks concrete forfeiture; pressure relies slightly on coincidence (eclipse timing) rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through curl's reprise and Finn's abandonment of the telescope, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("universe revealed... no lens could capture") offers non-literal answer to "ordinary magic," though "magic isn’t just about extraordinary" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphony only she could hear") and rhythmic control shine, but "cautious exuberance" feels like label rather than embodied emotion. Voice modulates well under pressure yet converges slightly during the eclipse climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied rhythm, but "ridge alive with anticipation/sky darkening" creates mixed metaphor. Paraphrase-loop in "deliberate steps... each note" followed by "hum, a melody that seemed to weave" incurs -0.2. Closure image remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse and "ordinary magic" transforms familiar tropes through specific details (cracked telescope, baby hair curl). Risk-taking elevates stakes but "dreaming roots" leans slightly toward whimsy without sufficient grounding in character logic.</comment>
