<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. desire for transparency) act in scene through micro-choices like tracing doodles, but Kian’s sudden thaw lacks sufficient causal buildup—his shift feels earned only by Elara’s action, not mutual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "mistrust began to thaw, freed by honesty" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (vulnerability as risk/reward), but Accumulative escalation lacks one intensifying pressure point to push into high-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting—damp ticket enables doodle examination, refracted light from lens charges the climax when Kian holds it to light, making environment indispensable to closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (thawing mistrust) tighten through Elara’s doodle-sketching agency under Accumulative lens, but cost remains emotionally diffuse; Kian’s "It’s beautiful" lacks palpable consequence beyond dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the lens metaphor: "even broken, it shows us something true" reweights honesty’s fragility without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fingers tracing damp edges," crystals’ "resonant hush"), but slight register drift in "ambiguously clear" repetitions undermines voice consistency during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clean, but "ambiguously clear" repeats 4x—borderline template cadence in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light/refraction metaphors grounds universal trust theme in specific objects (projector lens, cryptic doodles), though premise isn’t radically novel; risk in quiet resolution elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
