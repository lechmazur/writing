<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Limited interiority; Kael's restlessness lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Mira/Jorin/Lira function as archetypes without distinct flaws or micro-choices. Elara's altruism drives plot but her "brambling hope" remains abstractly described, missing embodied cost during pivotal garden work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: bell ringing crystallizes nebula's return with visible cost in Elara's fading. Orientation anchors ("orchard planet," "dawn") within 50 words. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics—e.g., bell's physical weight affecting Kael's strike—blocks 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating rock arches function as micro-setting: casting "long shadows" during garden work, constraining choreography. Watering bell's bronze material enables Jorin's clapper solution. Orchards remain generic backdrop without affecting choices; final nebula glow charges image but lacks tangible pressure on characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through garden restoration (one meaningful deepening), but cost remains conceptual (Elara's dissolution) rather than tactile. No visible price paid during escalation—e.g., injuries from clearing weeds or time pressure. Agency is collective but lacks individual trade-offs scaling to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brambled hope" motif reweighted at closure (orchids blooming), avoiding moralizing. Final line risks stating insight ("hope no longer brambled") but anchors in orchids for earned resonance. Lacks deeper complexity—no counter-readings of collective effort's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature; Kael's POV notices generic "dry earth" not orchard-specific details. Prose rhythm smooths under pressure but "brambled hope" repetition creates subtle scaffold. No dialogue to test distinctness; ghostly messages limit interiority depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears 3x with inconsistent metaphor (brambles ≠ weaving threads), causing minor figurative muddle. "Her hope brambling through their efforts like a thread" mixes vehicles, slightly dulling closure beat. Otherwise clean propulsion and sensory economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "orchard planet" with floating arches avoids sci-fi clichés. "Brambled hope" transforms from abstract to embodied via orchids at closure. Derivative premise guardrail applies—collective restoration trope—offset by specific watering bell mechanics and nebula's conceptual cost.</comment>
