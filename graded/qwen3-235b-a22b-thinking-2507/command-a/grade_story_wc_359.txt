<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in village backstory, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during action; "unfetter fears" stated not dramatized with embodied cost in pivotal bell-ringing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (personal triumph), but chisel-timing coincidence weakens causality; aurora-conduit mechanics remain unexplained, creating minor lens ambiguity for Accumulative/Textural design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (fractured ice crunch, aurora hues) anchor setting early, yet ice cavern fails to constrain choices or charge final image; micro-setting potential of amber sheet underutilized despite strong description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) signaled early with emotional escalation, but chisel-timing reliance on coincidence—not protagonist agency—undermines pressure buildup; cost remains abstract despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "sculpted hush" reconfiguration (silence as possibility), avoiding moralizing; final image’s "unfettered hope" resonantly answers central question without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via synesthesia ("blues of distant whispers") with rhythmic control; minor filter-verb clusters ("she felt") in high-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("mosaic of fractured ice") but paraphrase loops in cavern description ("crystalline walls... sculpted hush") create scaffold; no closure-dulling artifacts despite slight overwriting in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and ice magic avoids tropes through precise details (prism-song bells); emotional truth in "wonder as necessity" elevates beyond surface novelty with authentic village backstory motivation.</comment>
