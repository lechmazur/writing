<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradiction (curiosity as both savior and haunt) but "steadily curious" label risks stock phrasing; emotional progression layered yet closure cost ("felt hope") lacks visceral specificity in final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("Tower had fallen... something new could rise"); Accumulative lens holds as data/cards/tape layers reconfigure meaning, though micro-turn before dawn slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Measuring tape functions as micro-setting constraining choices (quantifying loss in inches), but rain-beaded loft remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics; final mural charges closure yet environment lacks causal pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover engineered crash) tightens through data-card integration; pressure escalates via Mira’s confession and Elara’s analysis, with cost crystallized in "months of despair" giving way to fragile hope under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (Tower card’s duality, tape measuring "weight of decisions"); final image reweights collapse as "blueprint" without moralizing, though "inherited mystery" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("digital pulse reduced to faint murmur," ink "swirling like storm clouds") modulates with pressure; minor register drift in "steadily curious" but rhythmic control sustains Accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose flows with textural specificity ("rain-tapped Morse code," "labyrinth of numbers"), yet paraphrase loop in "steadily curious" trait description dulls momentum; closure image ("map its ascent") resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy/data analysis avoids trope; measuring tape’s conceptual use (time/decisions) elevates premise, though cryptocurrency setting lacks transformative specificity for full 9-band.</comment>
