<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "gently meticulous nature now clashed with newfound urgency," but final choice lacks visible cost escalation; micro-choices like stepping toward light feel earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: transformed slide reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("no longer alone"), but tremor-to-transformation leap strains causality; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" setting charges closure ("hush seemed to soften") while constraining action (gloves against warmth); crystalline shelves refracting light actively shapes Elara’s frequency measurements and final purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen credibly as slides shift from records to "keys," but pressure lacks tangible narrowing; conceptual cost ("meaning carried forward") resonates though physical or relational forfeiture remains abstract in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "carry the light forward" reweights "edge of oblivion" without moralizing; final image of Elara "standing tall" offers non-literal answer to preservation vs transmission, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quartz hush" and light-frequency details; rhythmic control tightens during transformation ("trembled... crackled... spiked"), though "reverent" slightly drifts from Elara’s pragmatic voice in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("breath misted as she worked, fingers gloved to protect slides"); "luminous vows" motif evolves without muddle, though "scientific and reverent" slightly overwrites in measurement scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive tropes via light-frequency mechanics; "quartz hush" specificity anchors universals, but frozen library risks proximity to well-trodden "celestial archive" motifs without sufficient transformation.</comment>
