<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("strange resonance") without embodied contradiction; "perpetually surprised" trait is decorative label rather than driving micro-choices under pressure. Flaws lack compounding effect—Kael faces no meaningful struggle despite "genuine struggle" requirement. No visible cost scales to length beyond vague self-realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("fragments of himself"), but fails "cost proof test": no concrete on-page sentence shows legible cost beyond internal resonance. Accumulative lens holds through gathering pieces, yet escalation lacks meaningful pressure—finding artifacts feels frictionless despite "coherent pressure" requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choices via drone mapping and star-chart navigation, charging the final image with "brilliant dimness" chamber light. Sensory details (dust, fractured colors) filter through Kael’s professional gaze, though "brass box" corrosion lacks causal impact on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding belonging) tightens via artifact assembly, but pressure lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or felt trade-offs during searches. Cost remains conceptual rather than visible; "weight both familiar and alien" hints at internal cost but avoids dramatized forfeiture or tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "missing pieces" as physical/self fragments, but final paragraph’s explicit moralizing ("fragments of himself") triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty. Avoids tidy binaries yet over-explains resonance rather than charging closure through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in drone/astrolabe details reflects Kael’s technical POV, though "perpetually surprised" repetition flattens voice modulation under stress. Consistent psychic distance but passive constructions ("air grew colder") dilute immediacy during critical alcove discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Template cadence weakens propulsion: "perpetually surprised expression" repeats verbatim three times, triggering -0.4 loop penalty. Strong specificity in "corroded brass box" and "fractured colors," yet "strange resonance" lacks textural density for peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech with ancient observatory avoids derivative tropes, though "frequency of belonging" premise leans abstract. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off via star-trail mechanics, but emotional specificity lacks gritty human complexity beyond self-realization.</comment>
