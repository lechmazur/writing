<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("stone in her chest," tracing the saucer's fracture) and micro-choices (unfastening brooch as symbolic shedding). Final endurance—returning with presence—is causally earned through the vision's cost. Slight tidiness in epiphany prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the saucer's crack shifting from "wound" to "reminder" reconfigures time's fragility with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies via card draws and firefly vision—but escalation lacks one more decisive deepening beat before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Saucer crack functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (cradling it as imperfect reminder), constraining her ritual. "Choking beauty" phrasing slightly generic, but crystalline leaves and mossy ground filter through her grief, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with lost time) tightens through card draws that narrow options from seeking to acceptance. Agency shines in pressing her palm against the saucer, triggering the vision. Cost is visceral ("stone in her chest"), but the resolution leans slightly tidy for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through saucer crack's evolving meaning—final image ("cradling it gently") resonates without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "beauty in imperfection" in tactile details. Nearly flawless, but "fragility of time" edges toward abstraction without deeper counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("willingly perplexed," "choking beauty" filtered through grief) and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor flaw: "willingly perplexed" label appears twice without sufficient action-based demonstration in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "willingly perplexed" repetition creates a subtle synonym loop. Figurative language ("shadows that whispered") remains coherent, though "choking beauty" slightly muddles in the climax beat without deepening cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancer trope with cloudbound realm and saucer crack as time-map. Emotional specificity in "tracing hands" ritual avoids generality. Risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure works, but lacks one transformative detail to breach 8.8.</comment>
