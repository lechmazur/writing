<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "contain his essence" vs. "fleeting nature," with embodied grief in tea-sipping grounding; avoids diagnostic labels despite thematic risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when rain tapers and lion is held—"rust-hued peace" crystallizes cost of endurance; Accumulative lens holds via carving progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Loft’s rain-beaded skylight and chipped teacup constrain choices (tea grounding her during carving), charging final image; "rust-hued" light evolution avoids static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through emotional deepening as ash wood "whispers," narrowing options to endurance; felt cost in "grounding present" sip, but escalation lacks one visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood’s "resilience and surrender" mirroring grief; avoids moralizing as lion’s "serene repose" reweights impermanence without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("rust-hued peace," "tangled threads of emotions"); tension in "here and gone" refrain modulates rhythm, though "crystallized time" slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops but "hauntingly practical" repetition in tool description approaches scaffold; "mane wild and untamed" avoids purple prose yet "crystallized time" strains physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms widow trope via ash wood’s agency—carving as active endurance, not passive memorial; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
