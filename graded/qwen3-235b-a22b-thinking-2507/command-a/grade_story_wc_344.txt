<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("rhythm of repair") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; the hall of mirrors revelation feels earned yet abstract without visceral embodiment of cost. Flaws like "hands trembled" remain unexploited for genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of purpose clearer"), but the "unseen clock" motif’s payoff lacks concrete consequence. Orientation succeeds, though the Accumulative lens requires tighter pressure accumulation in the mirror sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors’ "colder, sharper" air charges the climax by distilling time’s essence, yet the "frozen library above clouds" remains postcard-like without constraining choices. Micro-setting (gears’ "hauntingly bright light") narrowly avoids 9-band cap by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via mirror distortions ("versions from different times"), but pressure escalates passively—the hall acts upon Elara rather than her choices narrowing options. The conceptual cost ("interconnectedness") feels earned yet lacks visible tradeoff like sacrificed knowledge or physical toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shifting prophecies and fractured reflections, avoiding moralizing. The final "harmony" realization reweights "rhythm of repair" non-literally, but "fractured prophecies" concept doesn’t fully reconfigure stakes at closure, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "prophecies shifting like shadows," with rhythmic control during mirror distortions. Minor register drift in "fractured prophecies" slightly jars, but consistent compression ("driftwood nostalgia") earns high band despite near-closure repetition of "distant morning."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("fingers brushed," "gears hummed"), but paraphrase loops dilute impact: "potential waiting to be unlocked" followed by "began to piece together." Final image avoids muddle, though "soft hush" overuse risks lyric redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Lunar-eclipse locksmith" transforms trope via time-repair synthesis, but eclipse motif remains ornamental. Hall of mirrors gains freshness through temporal distortions ("essence of time distilled"), though "rhythm of repair" edges toward familiar wisdom without sufficient risk-taking in emotional complexity.</comment>
