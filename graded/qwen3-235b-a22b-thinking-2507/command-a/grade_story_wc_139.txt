<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Clara holds out the ink pot: "This doesn’t make sense" against her father’s controlled frustration. Motivation ("mathematics of a fair trade") intensifies credibly to rejecting asylum. Slight therapy-speak in "fragile equation" undermines embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: father’s "tentative but sincere" grip crystallizes rebalanced relationship stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ink pot’s escalating resonance. Minor abstraction in "liquefying rigid thinking" slightly dulls causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: ink pot constrains choice (Clara lifting it risks father’s wrath) and charges closure ("set the ink pot down, its purpose fulfilled"). Funeral home prep room supplies active pressure via "tools" warning and "deathly vitality" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Clara’s agency: "waiting actively" evolves into speaking truth that forecloses asylum path. Cost is visceral in father’s "tentative" grip. Political asylum lacks concrete tactical impact, slightly muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through ink pot’s reweighting: "mathematics... wasn’t about numbers—it was about balance." Final image rejects moralizing while charging "breach the barriers" with conceptual cost. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Clara notices "murky as the ink" and "puzzle missing piece." Rhythm accelerates during father’s entrance ("She opened her mouth... but words caught"). Minor register drift in "fragile equation" for child’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "deathly vitality" recharges meaning economically. Final line’s cadence ("balance, honesty, and the courage") propels closure. "Tingling in her mind" borders on abstraction but saved by immediate action ("clutched the pot").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "honest child of con artist" trope through funeral home specificity and ink pot’s earned symbolism. Risk-taking with magical realism pays off thematically. Avoids safety middle via messy father-daughter resolution.</comment>
