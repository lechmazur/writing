<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vague motivation ("message across impossible distance") lacks contradictory impulses; sacrifice feels unearned as no hesitation precedes departure. Interiority remains abstract ("wistful," "mission") without embodied micro-choices under pressure during pivotal leaving moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping onto the bridge crystallizes options with visible cost ("weight of sacrifice... but also hope"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (shifting puzzle → intensifying bead glow), with cost legible in the final image's reconfigured silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bamboo forest/orchard setting charges the final image through constrained choices (loom left behind, backward-flowing streams). Recurring bead functions as micro-setting, directly enabling the bridge's manifestation and charging closure with tangible warmth against "raveling silence."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carrying message via silence) tightens through puzzle discoveries, narrowing options toward the bridge. Escalation driven by agency (Elara's piecing together) under Accumulative lens, though cost remains somewhat abstract until the earned "weight of sacrifice" crystallization in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete weaving/puzzle motifs without moralizing; final image ("became the message") reweights silence as connection. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in physical action (stepping onto bridge), though "tapestry of time" risks slight abstraction in last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused yet nimble," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in phenomena descriptions ("trees that sang... flowers that bloomed mid-air"), with all elisions (loom's purpose) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and specificity ("amber bead stoically sparkling"), but "raveling silence" overuse creates paraphrase loops (4x). Final line's "tapestry of time" slightly dilutes momentum, though no artifacts touch closure beat; density remains high through tactile details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving/puzzle metaphors transforms "message" trope into embodied connection. Risk-taking (textural silence as bridge) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "backward-flowing streams" provides specific verifiable detail that avoids generic mysticism.</comment>
