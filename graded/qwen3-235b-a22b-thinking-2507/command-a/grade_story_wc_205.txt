<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "burnished sorrow" stated but lacks embodied contradiction in climax. Flaws don't compound choices—she succeeds without meaningful tradeoffs. Diagnostic label-speak ("burnished sorrow") triggers penalty without immediate cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise (holographic proof/bittersweet triumph) but cost proof fails: "wounds remained unhealed" is told, not shown through image. Archaeological dispute resolves off-page ("forced to concede"), undermining causal weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystal shard functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (arranged in chamber) and charges final image ("stayed in her pocket... broken things hold light"). Baroque asteroid details remain postcard-like but shard elevates to meet 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when entering Hall, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the storm happens *to* her. Cost ("bittersweet triumph") is stated not felt; "wounds unhealed" lacks on-page embodiment. One tightening suffices but cost legibility weakens high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shard's refractions → holographic evidence → final pocket image reweights "reimagining" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "broken things hold light" delivers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice ("burnished sorrow," whispered poem) but "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beat violates emotional authenticity. Rhythmic control falters in climax with repetitive stems ("light surged... visions flooded... tears streamed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack in climax ("she believed... she knew... she needed") dulls immediacy. Paraphrase loop in finale: "reimagined Zahir-7... wounds unhealed. Shard... reminder broken things hold light." Artifacts touch closure, capping score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Temporal plasticity" offers fresh inflection, but emotional resolution ("bittersweet triumph") feels generic. Bold Accumulative structure pays off, yet "defunct revolutionary redeemed" trope limits synthesis. Lacks risk distinction despite lyrical ambition.</comment>
