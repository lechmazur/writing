<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("fingers traced contours," "breath caught") but epiphany ("courage to create it anew") feels unearned—no contradictory impulses in final beat, reducing causal weight of longing. "Cipher of longing" triggers diagnostic label penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise (painting as portal revealing courage), but cost remains conceptual, not legible on-page per cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds (light density intensifies), yet pressure lacks tightening—no visible tradeoff when dream "unravels" without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Watercolor palette functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (dipping cerulean during light surge) and charges final image ("colors still glowing softly"). "Salt-laden breeze" and "damp sand" anchor tactile urgency, though "whispering archipelago" edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering lost dream) signaled early but pressure never concretizes—light’s "pulsing" feels random, not escalating. No meaningful tightening; epiphany lacks visible cost. "Luminous absence" is thematic, not a felt price that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "painting with light" metaphor, but final line ("courage to create it anew") states moral, triggering thematic echo penalty. "Luminous absence" resonates, yet resolution avoids complexity—no counter-readings on whether creation truly heals loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hush of improbable beginnings," "watercolor palette shimmered faintly") with rhythmic control. Minor flaw: "cipher of longing" introduces therapy-speak label, briefly disrupting voice coherence during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose lush but climax beat suffers figurative muddle ("light danced in swirls and eddies" mixes incompatible physics). Template cadence ("She [verb], her [noun] [verb]-ing") in paragraph 4 dulls immediacy, though final image’s specificity ("colors still glowing softly") salvages propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography/watercolor vitalization elevates trope, but "whispering archipelago" and "runaway dream" lean derivative. Emotional truth in longing avoids sentimentality, yet resolution ("courage to create") chooses safe middle ground over bold risk.</comment>
