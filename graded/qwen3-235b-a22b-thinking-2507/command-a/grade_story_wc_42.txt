<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Limited internal contradiction; "luminous ache" lacks concrete embodiment. Motivation to harness the ephemeral is clear but lacks competing impulses beyond professional curiosity. Final choice earned through leaf insight, though emotional progression feels tidily resolved without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (observatory's shift from stillness to dynamic constancy). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via leaf motif and clock-hand reconfiguration. Cost proof weakens slightly as the "warm glow" lacks visceral tradeoff for the observatory's transformed state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: thin air and cold stone floor constrain Elara's physicality, while the clock hand directly charges the final image. "Sound of a leaf falling" evolves from imagined whisper to thematic anchor. Avoids white-room syndrome but clouds/moon risk cliché without deeper constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (taming time's chaos) tightens through Elara's agency: tremors → study → leaf insight → restructure. Cost is the observatory's irrevocable shift from "changeless stillness" to humming constancy. Escalation feels earned though the leaf epiphany resolves tension abruptly without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: restructured clock enables coexisting moments, rejecting frozen time. Final image ("harnessed the very essence of time") avoids moralizing by reweighting the ephemeral via observatory's transformation. No thematic echo, though "dance of surrender" risks abstract phrasing without deeper emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice distinct via repairer's precision ("gears intact, springs unwound") and sensory selectivity (ignoring clouds for clock mechanics). Rhythm modulates effectively under stress—shortened syntax during tremors. Minor register drift with "ephemeral" and "restructure time itself" slightly over-articulated for peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion via active verbs ("dismantle," "reimagine") but "luminous ache" and "essence of time" verge on abstraction. Single paraphrase loop: "fleeting nature of moments... slipped through fingers like grains of sand" redundantly echoes earlier ephemeral imagery. Final line achieves textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera repair + time mechanics avoids tropes through concrete stakes (spinning clock hand as escape velocity). Emotional specificity in Elara's tactile focus (tools, leaf sound) elevates "wise artisan" archetype. Risks middle-ground hedging by resolving conflict through singular epiphany without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
