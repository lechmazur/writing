<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices (lock handling, charcoal-stained fingers brushing crystals) but the rapid shift from paralysis to liberation lacks sufficient micro-choice escalation in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("rectification of years of silence") under Accumulative/Textural lens; disorientation waiver earned through motif payoff though glimmer discovery edges toward coincidence-complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave actively constrains choice (silence suffocating → womb) and charges final image; micro-setting of charcoal fingers/crystals shapes painting scene with tactile specificity that avoids symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mechanical repetition vs. authentic creation) deepens credibly through protagonist's realization of "chains," but escalation relies slightly on external discovery (glimmer) rather than pure agency under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through final painting/lock juxtaposition without moralizing; "auroral sorrow" reweights "inescapable callings" as liberation though the alcove note risks thematic echo without sufficient prior friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic shadows," "charcoal-stained fingers") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold but "mechanical repetition of what others wanted" borders on generic abstraction; final image ("woman emerging from shadows") avoids figurative muddle while sustaining propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms artist-block trope via crystal cave specificity and "auroral sorrow" tone; fresh synthesis in lock/painting symbolism feels inevitable though self-portrait discovery leans familiar.</comment>
