<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("resolute" yet "chronologically confused") drives micro-choices; embodied regret ("weight she carried in every step") avoids therapy-speak. Final shift to hope earns endurance with visible cost when wheel's hum syncs to thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accumulate density until Charged Poise closure ("ghost isn't enemy but guide") reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation clear by word 10; disorientation serves closure via "fractured stillness" motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon micro-setting constrains choices (mud-sinking boots, currents guiding fragments); camera wheel as recurring object charges final image ("lagoon’s currents stirring once more"). Sensory hierarchy reflects scavenger’s tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating eroded ambitions) tightens via camera wheel’s hum escalating to self-addressed plea. Agency-driven escalation culminates in stance crystallization with visible cost: regret transforms from "weight" to "spark of hope" without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (camera wheel, locket), not abstraction. Final image reweights "fractured stillness" as "beginning" without moralizing, resisting tidy binaries while embracing complexity of regret-as-guide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured stillness," "chronologically confused mind") filters all description. Rhythmic control under pressure ("static resolved into a voice, fragmented but recognizable") avoids uniformity; lyrical compression taught early via carousel halt imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "Regret clung to her like a second skin" slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise high density: "gears half-buried, its lens cracked but still gleaming faintly" does triple duty. No loops in peak beats; final line recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "ghost" as eroded ambitions transformed via scavenger’s method. Avoids safety middle by making regret tangible through fragments. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity anchors universals.</comment>
