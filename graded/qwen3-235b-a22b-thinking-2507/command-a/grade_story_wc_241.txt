<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality; "clover melancholy" borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied cost escalation during pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the final image’s reconfiguration lacks precise on-page cost anchoring; "ready to begin" softens the required felt price of her father’s legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mica pane functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (light manipulation) and charges closure; rainwashed library’s sensory specificity evolves with emotional beats without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding father) tightens through scrawl interpretation, but escalation lacks visible price—her midnight writing shift forecloses no path with concrete cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" reweights through lantern patterns without moralizing; final image’s "canvas" metaphor resonates non-literally but risks abstraction in "questions she would uncover."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile library details ("fingers tracing edges"), though "theoretical rebellion" phrasing momentarily drifts into academic register during high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but minor paraphrase loop ("delicate balance"/"fragile balance"); lyrical density peaks cleanly in closure without muddle despite stacked metaphors ("river," "dam," "rain").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Probability gambler angle transforms tropes via specific scrawl method, but "clover melancholy" feels quirkily ornamental rather than essential to emotional truth.</comment>
