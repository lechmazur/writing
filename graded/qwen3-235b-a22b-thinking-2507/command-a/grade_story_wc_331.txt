<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's "sanely eccentric" interiority shows contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs poetic faith) through embodied micro-choices like ignoring patrons during the spiral arrangement. Final guardianship choice is earned by her tactile interaction with fading stories, with visible cost in the fraying realm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara's return with restored scarf crystallizes her guardianship duty under conceptual cost ("the place was fading"). Causal lens holds perfectly—the geometry method directly unlocks the portal, with cost legible in "edges fraying like the scarf" during the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tattered scarf functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices (her talisman during ritual) and charging the final image (threads "whole and vibrant"). Sensory details like "lavender and old parchment" are selective and pressure-filtered, though occupational specificity in book arrangement could deepen further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally through three geometric arrangements (spiral → fractal → Möbius), narrowing options as patrons shift from browsing to awe. Cost is unmistakable: the fading story realm demands active protection, reconfiguring Elara's role from seeker to guardian with felt urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scarf's transformation—from "faded emerald threads" to "glowing ribbon"—offering a non-literal answer about analog memory's fragility. Avoids moralizing, but secondary stakes (why *her* duty?) could deepen the moral calculus beyond the dominant preservation conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shelves groaning under bound ideas") modulates rhythm under pressure—longer sentences during calculations, staccato phrasing at the climax ("The library trembled"). Zero head-hopping; elision of patron departure taught through context and paid off in solitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "kaleidoscope of words and images" compresses transformation without muddle. Final line "one book at a time" recharges scarf motif with precision. Minor deduction: "gave way to something sweeter" risks slight cadence template in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as operational method (not metaphor) transforms library tropes. Specificity anchors universals: Möbius strip in children's section ties to "simplest truths," avoiding quirkiness. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional complexity could deepen slightly.</comment>
