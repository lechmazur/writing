<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "anxious elation" repeats as label without embodied contradiction. Scars glow but fail to manifest genuine struggle beyond aestheticized pain. Micro-choices absent during pivotal clipping placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (scars pulsing), but "void she was determined to fill" remains abstract. Lens (Hybrid/Accumulative) holds, yet cost lacks visceral specificity at climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt glade constrains choice via shifting hedges, but "cobalt" hue feels decorative. Clipping functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Over-reliance on visual description weakens sensory hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend covenant) tightens via clipping’s guidance, but escalation lacks visible cost escalation—scars glow without tangible sacrifice. Agency in final placement is earned, yet prior cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through covenant’s mending, but "intersection of dreams" remains abstract. Final image reweights prior material without stating moral, yet thematic resonance is diluted by decorative "cobalt" symbolism over concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (root-bound urgency) modulates rhythm under pressure. "Anxious elation" repetition weakens voice coherence in peak beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" paraphrase loop (3x) dulls high-pressure beats. Strong verbs offset nominalizations, but "shimmered with otherworldly hue" strains physical logic. Final image’s propulsion compensates for minor scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms maze trope through root-bound physiology and clipped-object mechanics. Emotional specificity in "scars glowing in sync" avoids generic fantasy. Lacks one fresh inflection—covenant mending follows predictable restoration arc.</comment>
