<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in solitude/belonging tension, but "burnt feather as transformation" arrives too late to drive choices; micro-choices under pressure (dancing pre-escape) lack prior flaw embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost—abandoning fireflies—but alarm intrusion breaks Accumulative lens coherence; ocean pressure threat lacks causal setup, making escalation feel coincidental rather than rhythm-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lantern constrains choices (guiding sketches) and charges final image (clutched feather at sunrise); algae-coated domes and fireflies create visceral, pressure-sensitive specificity without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging vs. survival) deepen through rhythm realization, but alarm escalation lacks causal buildup; pressure shift feels unearned as prior serenity faces no organic threat, weakening cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete rhythm motifs ("breath syncing with pulses"), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "journey over destination" without stating it, though "broken things part of beauty" skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars trapped in a jar," fireflies as "distant constellations") persists under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's "rhythm of belonging" cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" repetition (lantern/precision) creates synonym churn in peak beats; "luminous respite" overuse dulls closure impact despite otherwise vivid propulsion and zero scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrologer-underwater premise avoids tropes through embodied rhythm focus; "shadowseam wonder" elevates setting beyond generic decay, though feather's transformation lacks grounding.</comment>
