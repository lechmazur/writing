<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s "wisely adventurous" trait manifests concretely in paint-peeling caution versus determined ascent, but internal conflict lacks layered contradiction beyond surface-level balance. Her renunciation of personal claim for collective wisdom earns closure with felt conceptual cost, though emotional complexity remains slightly underdeveloped in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive holds firmly: murals unlock archway sequence, leading to Conceptual Repricing closure where throne’s collective purpose reweights the quest with undeniable conceptual cost. Sunrise deadline weakens escalation by remaining abstract despite early setup, missing one opportunity for tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall actively guides Lira’s path (colors "beckon," veil hides door), while the ruby flake constrains choices and charges the final image—its blaze triggering the stars’ shift. Environment isn’t backdrop but functional pressure, satisfying the 9+ gate via recurring object constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway before sunrise) tightens at the sealed archway, forcing symbol-sequence problem-solving. Yet sunrise timeframe lacks active constraint—it’s declared but never tightens tactics, muting cost legibility despite the earned conceptual resolution at the throne.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: Lira’s physical journey crystallizes into the non-literal realization that "throne was not meant to be claimed," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the quest’s premise with conceptual cost (abandoning power for legacy), satisfying Q5’s 9+ quick test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV voice distinctively filters urgency ("boots crunched on crystalline ground," "air grew thinner"), with rhythmic control tightening during ascent. Minor register drift in high-pressure beats ("air grew thinner" feels slightly clinical) prevents 9.0+, though perceptual signature remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose shines in sensory specificity ("bioluminescent vines," "crystalline ground") but falters with minor scaffold: "wisely adventurous" tells rather than shows, and "steps guided by faint light/whispers" paraphrases adjacent lines. No closure-impacting artifacts, yet density dips in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms quest tropes through specific, organic details: throne’s "spiral pattern" echoing murals/stairway creates conceptual inevitability, while "futuristic nostalgia" tone avoids gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels earned—removing the orchard’s light-pulsing fruit would fracture the setting’s causal role in guiding Lira.</comment>
