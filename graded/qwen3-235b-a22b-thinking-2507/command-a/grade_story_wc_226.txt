<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks embodied tension; "diagnostic label-speak" in climax ("forgiveness is not a gift...") triggers -0.6 penalty. Motivation clear but micro-choices passive—rebellion stated not tested through tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("surrender a shard of her heart"), but lens ambiguity—shifts from causal (ritual warnings) to accumulative—past midpoint triggers -0.3. Orientation solid but spire's magic feels convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory language ("ethereal colors," "cold damp stone") yet setting remains atmospheric backdrop; bone towers/canyon don't constrain choices or charge final image. "Forged hush" evocative but generic—fails 9+ gate requiring environment to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("price of forgiveness") signaled early, escalation via mist density/poetic urgency, but pressure driven by spire not protagonist agency. Cost ("surrendering a piece of herself") legible but not embodied in choices—lacks visible price altering tactics per 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refraction metaphor, but climax declares thesis ("forgiveness is not a gift...") violating organic emergence. Final path image resonates yet undercut by character's explicit moralizing—avoids full penalty only as dialogue, not narration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers," "ethereal colors") and rhythmic control in poetry beats. Stress inconsistency: elevated diction ("What is the price of forgiveness?") under peak pressure violates degraded cognition rule.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyric density falters in closure beat: "unburdened" is abstract scaffold, "light coalesced into shapes" stacks metaphors. Template cadence ("She pressed on... She realized...") in high-pressure section triggers -0.5 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone towers/spire refracting truth, but "forgiveness journey" trope dilutes originality. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.3) as moral calculus lacks non-obvious specificity despite strong voice.</comment>
