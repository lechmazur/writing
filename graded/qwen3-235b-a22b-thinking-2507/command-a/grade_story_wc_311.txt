<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "once-fierce purpose had crumbled" versus naming drive, but transformation lacks visible struggle during crystallization climax; embodied grief ("tremor in her heart") avoids therapy-speak yet micro-choices feel too resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("weight of their choices settle on her shoulders"), but "scattered light" method lacks early setup—appears only at climax, weakening causal linkage under Accumulative lens despite strong final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory constrains choice (platform placement) and charges closure ("walls now held a new echo"); runes and dome mechanics evolve with events, avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring internal state through "shards of light" and vibrating walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (meaning from loss) tighten via sensory density ("air thickened with weight of forgotten phrases"), reweighting sacrifice through crystallization; cost legible in "quiet sorrow that mirrored her own," fulfilling Accumulative escalation with protagonist-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "light that remained" reweighting sacrifice; avoids moralizing by showing emotional alchemy via naming, with final image ("carry these names into her next journey") resonating beyond plot without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadows of centuries" noticing and rhythm shifts from lyrical ("sea dipped into the sea") to compressed ("Through scattered light") under stress; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "parchment, now heavy with the stories" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("crystallizing into solid, translucent beings") avoids muddle in peak beats while varying sentence rhythm supports scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reaper trope transformed via specific grief angle ("lost the one soul she swore to protect"), with emotional truth elevating "naming nameless fears" into fresh metaphor; avoids derivative safety by committing to irreversible loss without tidy resolution.</comment>
