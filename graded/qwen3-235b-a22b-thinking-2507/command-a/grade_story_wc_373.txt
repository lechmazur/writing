<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses (cold determination vs. inherited burden) manifest in her weaponizing the fob rather than seeking revenge, but fortune-teller scene lacks concrete micro-choices to deepen interiority beyond "burden" abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Lila’s refusal to escalate violence preserves the fragile truce with visible cost ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired"), though necklace clue arrival feels slightly convenient under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rotting pier’s salt/decay sensory details constrain choices (vendors, scarred man’s flask refusal) and charge the final image—dawn light on silent market mirroring the "quiet" trust fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila’s verbal confrontation narrowing options to "words and wit," but the truce’s fragility lacks felt cost until the final realization, slightly delaying escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>"Sound of trust breaking" motif evolves from goal to weapon to quiet fracture in the final line, reweighting the premise without moralizing, though "reluctant guardian" risks slight sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read silences between words") shines in market navigation, but dialogue with thieves verges on thematic echo ("it’s a symbol... trust disappeared") reducing subtext density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops and strong propulsion until "symbol" dialogue line, where slightly elevated diction clashes with Lila’s established lexicon, dulling peak-beat immediacy by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh "truce of hush" concept transforms pirate tropes through specific moral calculus (trust as currency), but market setting leans generic despite strong sensory anchoring.</comment>
