<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("mentor resilience") is clear but abstract; "combative tenderness" shown via tea-leaf analysis lacks embodied contradiction during peak pressure when shadow "mocked her." Micro-choice depth insufficient for 8.0+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("shard-mirror no longer felt like a prison but a portal") lands with visible cost—her breath shallowing earlier now replaced by "quiet resolve." Accumulative lens holds through tea-leaf pattern shifts without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library atmosphere vivid ("damp wood scent," "groaning shelves"), but micro-settings (shard-mirror, tea leaves) charge the finale without constraining choices. Misses 9+ gate as no object alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s deepening annotation (tea leaves shifting from "frayed letter" to "river breaking dam"), narrowing options to this single act. Cost legible in her physical strain transforming to resolve—"breath shallow" to "steady" backwards walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilient endurance emerges through concrete particulars (scars as "badges," tea-leaf mountains), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("more shadows to free") reweights exile without stating a moral, though secondary "resilience" thread slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("steam curling like whispers," "shadows blurring like glass") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from "flickering reflection" tension to crystalline resolve without POV slippage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "crescent moon" leaf tracing does triple duty (character, setting, stakes). Minor paraphrase loop ("silence both haunting and serene... silence no longer empty") costs 0.4 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Shard-mirror archivist" transforms trope via tea-leaf geometry method. Emotional specificity in "scars badges of honor" avoids cliché, though "reversible exile" concept leans familiar without deeper rule-set innovation.</comment>
