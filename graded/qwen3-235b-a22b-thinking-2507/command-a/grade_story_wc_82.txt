<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s embodied grief (calloused hands vs. hollow craft) and micro-choice to unfold the crane. No therapy-speak; the shadow realization emerges through tactile action, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: unfolding the crane crystallizes options with visible cost ("first genuine smile"). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies through light/shadow shifts, narrowing Kael’s emotional stance without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (origami crane) constrains choice and charges closure: worn paper guides Kael’s tactile realization. Sensory hierarchy excels—tea-leaf rustle and dreamstone texture filter through grief, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative pressure when Lira’s "grief is not meant to be folded" shatters Kael’s craft-based coping. Agency in walking to the basilica forecloses escapism, with cost legible in his trembling hands and emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crane motif’s evolution: folding as denial → unfolding as release. Final line ("craft it to honor it") reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via concrete action over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices gem fractures and tea-leaf whispers, not landscapes. Rhythmic control peaks in basilica scene—short sentences mirror his unraveling ("With trembling hands, he began to unfold the crane").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in climax ("each crease a memory, each fold a moment of sorrow"). Mild overwriting in "mist clung like a lover’s whisper" but compensated by purposeful cadence shifts under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-recording lanterns transform grief into tangible craft, avoiding tropey "art heals pain." Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional specificity—no confrontation, yet stakes feel visceral through micro-choices.</comment>
