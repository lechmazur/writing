<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (mending spirits vs own unrest), but "lucid unrest" abstract without sufficient embodiment; micro-choice in whispering plea earned final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("heart heavy but at ease"); accumulative lens holds perfectly through knot resistance deepening pressure; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice (stained glass shadows charge climax) and reweights final image; micro-setting of needle/net directly alters tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (knot resistance narrowing options); cost unmistakable in "heart heavy but at ease" as spirits find peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image reweights "mending the broken" as self-healing without stating moral; avoids thematic echo but edges toward neat resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("frayed edges," "interlaced hush") with rhythmic control; minor abstraction in "silence accumulated" slightly dulls peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with strong propulsion, but "lucid unrest" and triple "accumulated silence" create minor abstraction loops in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of restoration as spiritual communion; transforms trope through specific knot-unraveling ritual but lacks radical structural risk.</comment>
