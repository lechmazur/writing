<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied sacrifice (“hollow ache where the scar had been”) grounds her motivation, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—her choice feels inevitable rather than wrestled with under pressure. Micro-choices are sparse beyond the ring’s activation, missing opportunities to show hierarchy-of-values tradeoffs during escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with the severed scar’s cost, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the darkness’s pressure never forces tactical adaptation beyond Lira’s established method. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet density peaks too early without a mid-scene intensification that reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “ashen charcoal sanctuary” creates vivid atmosphere, but remains backdrop rather than constraint; starlight and scars charge the final image yet fail to alter Lira’s choices mid-conflict. Micro-setting (doorknocker ring’s cracked state) elevates closure, narrowly clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (sanctuary’s survival) are clear and cost visible (broken scar), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening—Lira merely channels existing strength without adapting tactics as darkness encroaches. Pressure tightens once via the ring’s activation, but agency feels passive against the threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through “teach suffocating to breathe,” crystallizing in the final image’s resonant cost: the sanctuary endures but Lira’s hollow ache reweights transformation as sacrifice. No moralizing—only the scar’s absence silently answers the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“scars that glimmered faintly under the night sky”) and rhythmic control shine, but minor register drift (“suffocating presence”) slightly undermines Lira’s voice during peak pressure. Consistent focalization avoids head-hopping, with sensory details filtered through her guardian role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion falters in minor synonym loops (“fading threshold” repeated early) and slight overwriting in the climax (“chorus of resilience”). No closure-dulling artifacts, but density could tighten—e.g., “tendrils of shadow snaking” slightly over-embellishes the encroachment beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Linking through scars” transforms familiar guardian tropes through specific mechanics, yet the premise’s emotional core relies on universal sacrifice rather than irreplaceable detail. Risk-taking in tone (“loaded emptiness”) elevates it, but the sanctuary’s rules lack distinctive logic to push beyond strong execution.</comment>
