<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (silence vs being heard) drives final choice; embodied emotion in journal scene ("heart pounded") avoids labels. Slight tell-not-show in "chased hush" early reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (rejecting hush legacy); Accumulative lens holds via sensory pressure buildup. Copperlight-to-dawn shift reweights stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lattice functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (clutching during descent) and charges final image ("couldn’t hold him back"). Reef/copperlight evolve causally with emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem name vs truth) tightens through journal discovery; agency-driven deepening reconfigures options. Cost unmistakable in "no longer son of boy who cried wolf" crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("boy who chased truth") reweights cry-wolf legacy without moralizing; thematic resonance emerges from lattice/hush particulars. No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("scuffs telling tales," "copperlight repose"); rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during descent). Minor register drift in "refuge and curse" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose prose ("lattice sustained impossibilities" sets rules/theme). Near-synonym loop ("refuge and curse" → "silence he’d chased") causes mild momentum drag pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cry-wolf legacy transformed via hush-as-curse and lighthouse-as-labyrinth. Emotional specificity in rejecting silence for truth avoids trope recycling.</comment>
