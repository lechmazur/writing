<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "desperately jocular" stated not demonstrated through action. Diagnostic label-speak ("loneliness that lingers even in a crowd") triggers -0.6 penalty without embodied cost within 3 lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost proof fails: no exact sentence/image showing legible price paid (e.g., "heart no longer heavy" avoids tangible loss). Orientation clear by line 3, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Station described vividly but fails micro-setting test: ivy/clock don’t constrain choices or charge final image. Moon rock’s "coolness" grounds Elara once but lacks tactical pressure. Sensory detail selective yet inert for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes clear (cure for loneliness) but escalation passive; clock transformation via object contact, not agency. No visible price paid during change (e.g., effort, sacrifice). "Catalyzed" action driven by coincidence, not earned pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids thematic echo; "polite anarchy" crystallizes non-literal answer through concrete image (genuine laughter). Resists moralizing but "reciprocity" concept remains abstract rather than embodied in final choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crumbling buildings and whispers of what once was") with rhythmic control. Minor filter-verb drift ("she felt a strange pull") but compression taught early. Voice modulates effectively from melancholy to hope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("air thick with... footsteps echoed") and generic descriptors ("smooth and otherworldly"). Avoids fatal artifacts but "relentless in its growth" cliché dulls closure beat. High density otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Disaster-relief lens transforms "magical station" trope with emotional specificity. Moon rock talisman avoids quirkiness but "versions of herself" borders cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
