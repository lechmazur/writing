<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in hesitation versus action; embodied emotion via trembling hand and weight-lifting chest. "Wisely enduring" label slightly abstracts peak-beat cost, preventing 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (erased scroll as liberated canvas), anchored by stalactite rhythm shift. Accumulative lens holds cohesively; orientation clear by paragraph one. No causality breaks but density lacks one persistent constraint for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctuary constrains choice through drip-synchronized heartbeat and spatial echoes, charging final image. Aurora’s color shift mirrors emotional transformation. Cap at 8.8 per gate rule—setting enhances but doesn’t actively constrain tactics during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize via single tightening: hesitation to erasure forecloses bitterness with felt cost (chain breaking in soul). Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens; stalactite slowdown proves cost legibility. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (erasing as forgiveness), not abstraction. Final blank-scroll image resonates as "canvas" without moralizing, reweighting betrayal as possibility. Avoids sentimentality while embracing complexity of self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora painted ceiling with hues of pearl twilight") modulates rhythm under stress. Slight register drift with "calibrated treason" in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0, but elision (father’s backstory) taught and paid off via scroll.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "chain breaking within her soul" charging climax. Minor overwriting in "hushed embrace of the marble sanctuary" slightly dulls immediacy. No artifacts in closure beat preserves high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forger’s skill as emotional tool avoids trope; rose thorn’s erasure mechanic transforms forgiveness cliché. Sanctuary setting leans generic but specificity (stalactite drip as metronome) anchors universals. Lacks one bold risk for 9.0.</comment>
