<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strengths: Embodied conflict ("heart ached," "breath catching") and micro-choices (clutching shell during cameo) reveal value hierarchy. Weakness: "conflicted nature warred within her" triggers diagnostic label penalty (-0.4) in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("conflicted nature giving way to purpose") under Accumulative lens. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics precludes 9.0; mist lifting lacks causal link to final writing act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting (thickening/wrapping, lifting at resolution) charging final image. Fails 9+ gate: environment doesn't constrain choices (e.g., no physical barrier forcing path selection), merely reflects internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("weight of another's pain") deepen through cameo accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—soldier/poet/child appear passively. Cost felt in transformation, but tactics don't alter until climax (shell glow response).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (barnacles on shell, mother's story), avoiding moralizing. Final writing act offers resonant answer to "collecting hopes," but "solemnize" repetition risks thematic echo without sufficient variation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air alive with secrets," "whispers grew louder") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in climax ("words flowing like a river"), though "feral nexus" phrasing slightly drifts from novelist's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("object felt heavy... not from weight") and template cadence ("a soldier... a poet... a child") trigger -0.5. High density maintained, but figurative muddle in "hush of a feral nexus" slightly dulls opening clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "writer's block" trope through visceral hope-fragments (mother's story etched in soul). Freshness in "resilience as shell fragment," though "feral nexus" leans derivative. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
