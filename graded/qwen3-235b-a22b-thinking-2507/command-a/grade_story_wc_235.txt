<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in envy of past selves versus present inertia, embodied through trembling hands and "poison seeping into her veins." Final choice to write earns closure through causal chain from grave visit to scroll realization, though past selves' dialogue edges toward abstraction without sufficient physical stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "the weight of feral nostalgia lifting like a fog" crystallizes cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors cabin/grave early; density escalation from fragmented memories to unified "now" reweights stakes flawlessly. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting that charges closure—glowing reprise in final image reconfigures meaning. Cabin details (pine scent, creaking floor) vividly filter Elara’s urgency, though mountains remain postcard backdrop without constraining choices beyond ambiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (envy vs. acceptance) tightens through deepening, not reversal: scroll’s message forces trade-off between past selves and present. Cost is unmistakable—"weight lifting like a fog"—and Elara’s agency drives escalation toward crystallized stance without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scroll’s evolving meaning: "The story is not in the past or future—it is now" avoids moralizing while reweighting prior chaos. Final image (mountains humming) resonates as non-literal answer to central question, with "jaded wonder blooming" charging earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in sensory compression ("amber and violet sky," "shattered mirror" memories). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—fragmented syntax during turmoil shifts to fluid certainty in closure—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "feral nostalgia" embodied as "poison seeping into her veins" avoids label-speak. Minor deduction for "jaded wonder" repetition in peak beats, but propulsion remains relentless. Final line’s cadence ("peaks touching sky like fingers brushing eternity") crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" transforms stock regret into visceral constraint; birch bark scroll as mind-map synthesizes dream logic with emotional specificity. Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though cabin setting lacks fresh inflection beyond genre convention.</comment>
