<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("latent blaze") but lacks contradictory impulses; "prism-minded" trait shown in navigation yet internal conflict remains abstract. Final choice (taking seed) feels unearned without prior flaw-driven struggle. Embodied emotion strong during inversion ("fingers trembling") but closure cost lacks visceral depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: seed acquisition forecloses "forgotten combinations" quest with visible cost ("responsibility, a promise"). Causal lens holds through gravity inversion mechanics. Minor deduction as conceptual cost ("legacy of protection") lacks tangible on-page consequence despite "heart alight" resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Luminescent veins function as micro-setting that guides navigation and charges final image ("grotto returned to normal state... seed in hand"). Grotto pressure choices via revealed passages during inversion. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn't constrain tactics until climax despite vivid sensory anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("to find where forgotten combinations hide") and tighten through gravity inversion’s time pressure. Agency-driven escalation: doodle study → pool entry → crystal alignment. Conceptual cost ("responsibility") legible in final line though physical/emotional toll remains abstract. Perfect causal escalation within scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds of vigilance" as earned stewardship, not moralizing. Final image ("seeds... to sow into legacy") reweights prior quest with conceptual cost without abstraction. Avoids thematic echo; "latent blaze" motif evolves from motivation to duty. Non-literal answer resonates through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-minded," "kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge") modulates under stress ("world tilted"). Rhythmic control varies sentence structure during inversion sequence. Minor deduction for "latent blaze" repetition but no head-hopping; voice sustains causal intensity through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in mid-section ("Elara... stood... Elara’s motivation... Elara had studied") creates rhythmic monotony. Filter verbs ("she knew," "was fixated") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats. No closure artifacts, but scaffolded phrasing impedes momentum in development beats. Text-artifact penalty applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Prism-minded archivist" transforms trope through grotto mechanics; gravity inversion as threshold feels fresh yet inevitable. Emotional specificity in quiet resolve avoids generic templates. Risk distinction (+0.3) for lyrical "latent blaze" motif that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis elevates familiar quest.</comment>
