<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "warmly inquisitive" trait is stated not tested through cost. Strong embodied emotion in goggles/breath, but grief resolution feels unearned without visible struggle against avoidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds with Charged Poise (tears/warmth crystallizing stance) under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: "scattered light" mechanic never constrains choices despite repeated mentions, weakening density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Goggles function as micro-setting charging closure ("part of her own"), but icebound spire remains atmospheric backdrop. Aurora's "scattered light" fails Q3 9+ gate—never constrains choices or alters tactics despite five mentions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen cleanly through knowledge accumulation, but pressure lacks tangible antagonism. Cold/thin air noted yet never impedes actions; cost remains purely emotional without physical consequence to narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through decryption metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Diary's explicit "joy is not absence of anguish" risks Thematic Echo but is redeemed by embodied cost (tears/warmth) and spire's ice-as-grief resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scans," "unfolds") modulates with emotional intensity. "Warmly inquisitive" is stock phrasing that flattens interiority, but rhythmic control in elevator ascent maintains pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "scattered light" overuse (5x) without payoff creates decorative redundancy. "Otherworldly glow" edges toward purple prose yet avoids muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief processing via decryption metaphor elevates familiar elevator-quest structure. Emotional specificity in "melting detachment" avoids sentimentality, though spire setting leans archetypal.</comment>
