<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear (personal loss driving archival work) but interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; final choice lacks visible cost beyond general melancholy. "Collective pain" borders on diagnostic label-speak without embodied tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "healing was not just an act but a process" crystallizes cost with undeniable pressure. Accumulative lens holds through photograph arrangement deepening, no orientation debt. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity in lavender/factory contrast, but setting functions as backdrop not constraint. Map case appears frequently yet never alters tactics; fails 9+ gate by not charging final image or limiting choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting pain) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—agency remains observational. Conceptual cost ("process requiring patience") legible yet insufficiently visceral for high-band entry; no tactics altered by pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through photograph arrangement, avoiding direct moralizing. Final image ("lavender field whispered approval") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "collective healing" edges toward thematic echo in mid-section.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dove gray map case," "earnest whimsy") with rhythmic control. Consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Lacks pressure test for modulation under stress, but lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("subtle puzzle archivist" opening). Strategic telling compresses backstory cleanly. Mild register drift in "transmute pain into masterpiece" avoids therapy-speak due to concrete anchoring in photo arrangement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archivist trope transformed via tactile process (photograph arcs) and lavender/ruin juxtaposition. "Earnest whimsy" tone avoids sentimentality through specificity. Fresh synthesis evident in closing map case imagery recharging prior motifs.</comment>
