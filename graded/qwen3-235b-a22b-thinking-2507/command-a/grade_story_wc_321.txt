<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Mara's resilience never wavers under pressure, reducing interior complexity. "Resiliently positive" trait informs actions but avoids authentic emotional contradiction, though micro-choices (handing hourglass to transient) reveal value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (Mara's collapse), but causality falters: merging timelines requires no tangible sacrifice beyond fatigue. Radio call serves as weak escalation; the transient's warning doesn't meaningfully narrow options before the rift leap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spectral grotto functions as indispensable micro-setting: shifting symbols actively constrain choices, and the hourglass's physical properties (smooth glass, glowing sand) charge the final image. Starlight isn't decorative—it enables pattern recognition critical to Mara's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (saving trapped souls) are clear but escalate minimally; the transient's warning is the sole opposition. Cost (Mara's weakening) is present but feels abstract—no specific loss (e.g., time, memory) alters tactics. Agency shines in rift entry but resolution relies on underdeveloped mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through time's fragility (hourglass, sideways clocks), avoiding moralizing. Final image—filled hourglass against starlight—resonantly answers "transience" without stating morals, though "resiliently positive" trait occasionally borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in time-focused details ("minutes stretched into hours"), but filter verbs ("she suspected") dilute immediacy during high-pressure beats. Voice modulates well under stress, though the transient's dialogue lacks idiom distinct from Mara's internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Negligible scaffold; "resiliently positive" is the sole near-label in peak beats. Sentence rhythm accelerates during rift entry ("world dissolved into kaleidoscope"), but "air shimmered with otherworldly glow" slightly overwrites. Zero loops in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through grotto's tactile specificity (stone under feet, etched symbols). Risk-taking (merging timelines via patterns) heightens stakes coherently, though the hourglass mechanic leans familiar. Emotional truth in Mara's quiet exhaustion elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
