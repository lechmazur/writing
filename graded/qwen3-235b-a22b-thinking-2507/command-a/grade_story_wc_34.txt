<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (freeing the ghost) is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; her altruism lacks competing impulses beyond "strange kinship." "Driftingly alert" remains a label without embodied tradeoffs during high-pressure encoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Elara's acceptance of ongoing work forecloses isolation with the cost of the ghost's dissolution ("essence scattered like stardust"). Accumulative lens holds via storm-intensified density, though the lightning/thunder timeframe's urgency lacks precise clock pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate charges the final image ("now silent in her hands"), but its function as a "conduit" remains abstract. The misty courtyard shapes atmosphere yet fails to constrain choices—e.g., no tactical use of wind or lightning beyond symbolic timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing the ghost) tighten meaningfully via the lightning/thunder window, but protagonist agency falters when the ghost "directs her" fingers. The cost of the ghost's departure feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in Elara's physical or emotional state post-dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme ("giving voice to the voiceless") emerges organically through the ghost's release and Elara's next composition, avoiding moralizing. The final image—a ballad "for the unseen"—resonantly reweights the premise without stating a moral, though "true power of her gift" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispers of the storm" and "tinkersong wonder," but "driftingly alert" disrupts POV consistency. Rhythmic control under pressure excels ("fingers moved swiftly"), though non-standard phrasing risks artifice without full pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and textural specificity ("luminous figure, both ethereal and solid"), but "tinkersong wonder" repetition and stacked modifiers ("faint glow of distant lightning") create minor density issues. No loops dull closure, though "fragmented consciousness" slightly echoes "fragmented thoughts."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost via graffiti and balladeer-cryptographer avoids trope pitfalls, with emotional specificity in Elara's kinship. The bolt plate's oddity feels organic, though its "flower press" function lacks transformation—nearly derivative but saved by cohesive stakes.</comment>
