<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract; embodied emotion lacks specificity ("tremor within" generic). Final endurance earns cost through vision's emotional shift, but micro-choices under pressure remain sparse beyond seashell grip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: melancholy yields to resolve with visible cost in final image. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, but midpoint ambiguity risks cohesion. Disorientation pays off via starlight nexus closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry anchors early (scent of ancient secrets, pulsing ground), yet serpentine nexus functions as static backdrop rather than constraining choice. Micro-setting (seashell) charges final image but lacks mid-scene tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding echoes) tightens via pool vision, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost legible in melancholy's transformation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; figure's revelation resolves rather than tests agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through echo patterns as "threads woven by universe," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights inquiry into purpose without stating moral, though "profound ways" risks abstraction. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("richly perceptive" filtering details) and rhythmic control shine, but register drifts into elevated diction during vision ("ripples through time"). Elision of backstory taught early and paid off in pool sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Elara’s...") and synonym churn ("haunting melody"/"probing melody") dull immediacy. Overwritten metaphors in high-pressure beats ("reed-blown melancholy") reduce clarity despite lyrical intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical quest with echo physics avoids trope pitfalls. Bold structural risk (lyric accumulation over causal turns) heightens thematic resonance, though "canyon echo singer" archetype lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
