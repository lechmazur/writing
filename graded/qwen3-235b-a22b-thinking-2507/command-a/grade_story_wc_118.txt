<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but interior contradiction is thin; "sensitively perceptive" trait remains label-heavy without embodied tradeoffs during the ritual’s peak pressure. No visible cost to her character beyond the ritual’s success, weakening the earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: diaries → scrolls → ritual creates a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost ("weight of centuries pressing upon her") that reconfigures the world’s state without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The silo library’s "bronze quiet" and rusted panel function as micro-setting that constrains choices (hiding the scrolls), charging the final image when replaced by "vibrant symphony." Slight genericism in "hollow shell" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring dreams) escalate through Elara’s agency discovering scrolls and performing the ritual, narrowing options meaningfully. But the cost remains abstract—"weight of centuries" lacks visceral, character-specific consequence to elevate higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the tapestry’s shift from "fragment" to ritual focal point reweights imagination’s role without moralizing. Final image ("world dreamed again") resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question of lost dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bronze quiet" and tactile focus (fingers tracing tapestry edges) modulates with ritual intensity. Rhythmic control tightens during the altar scene, though "sensitively perceptive" repeats as a near-label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "sensitively perceptive" appears twice as near-therapeutic label without concrete embodiment. Final line’s "vibrant symphony" edges toward abstraction, dulling closure’s textural specificity slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes post-apocalyptic and historical tropes freshly through the "displaced axis" concept and silo library setting. Risk-taking in the ritual’s quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "last human dream" premise borders on familiar.</comment>
