<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "heart steady" during climax feels emotionally sanitized without conflicting impulses. No visible struggle between duty and fear despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (memory preservation), but causal linkage falters: the monsoon’s threat remains abstract despite "fraying" signs. Cost proof test fails—no specific on-page forfeiture or irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (blooms breathing with heartbeat, luminous doubt) anchor the setting early, yet environmental pressure on choices is minimal; ridge blooms whisper encouragement but don’t constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory preservation) is signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—monsoon arrives as passive backdrop, not live clock altering Elara’s tactics. Pressure remains static after creature encounter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory/fantasy balance is coherent but undermined by final paragraph’s direct statement: "thanks to Elara’s luminous doubt." Thematic Echo in closing lines triggers -0.6 penalty per guidelines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous doubt," empirically whimsical lens) sustains voice, though dialogue lacks subtext—creature’s "prove your worth" test feels ritualistic rather than character-revealing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and controlled, but "air shimmered with promise of life" risks figurative muddle early on. No loops or scaffold in closure beat, though "luminous doubt" recurs as label without concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reality checker" trope through empirically whimsical lens, yet emotional specificity lacks depth; villagers’ misremembering feels generic rather than verifiable human detail.</comment>
