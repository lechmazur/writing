<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (compass spinning vs. pole navigation), but "backlash of regrets" drifts into diagnostic label-speak without immediate physical cost. Final choice to tuck compass earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("regrets lingered but no longer defined her") under Accumulative lens. Sensory density escalates meaningfully as poles fade, reweighting stakes through cadence shift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (navigation method) and charges closure (fading into hope). Compass scars and kayak hull tactilely embody her persistence, avoiding overt symbolism while shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation deepens internal stakes through sensory accumulation (compass→poles→water), narrowing options to adaptation. Cost is unmistakable in "learning to move with it" with visible pressure from regret’s weight to measured hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: broken compass→pole navigation reweights "perfection" into adaptation. Final "merrily melancholic smile" resonates non-literally without moralizing, embracing complexity through earned ambiguity in regret’s role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (navigator noticing spacing/weathering) modulates rhythm effectively, but "backlash of regrets" causes minor register drift into therapeutic diction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("fractured heart"/"adrift, faith flickering") triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion, though "merrily melancholic" risks cliché but is redeemed by contextual specificity in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through concrete details (astronomical compass, pole spacing) and emotional specificity. "Functional, neither beautiful" kinship avoids sentimental resolution, synthesizing regret/adaptation with fresh inevitability.</comment>
