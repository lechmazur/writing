<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion through the hourglass sand grain and chemical message, but "purposefully curious" remains stated rather than demonstrated via contradictory impulses during pressure. Micro-choices like ignoring the communicator reveal values, yet the final endurance lacks sufficient prior causality to feel fully earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost (clutching the sand grain at departure), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—the Accumulative/Textural drive isn't firmly established until the dawn approach, weakening early escalation under the selected lens despite functional orientation anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lunar regolith crunch and module’s chemical reaction actively constrain choices (dawn deadline), while the summit’s slow orbit directly charges the final image. Sensory details like "breath fogging the visor" filter through Elara’s scientific lens, making the environment indispensable to the closure’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving history) tightens via the dawn deadline, forcing Elara’s endurance with felt cost. However, escalation leans on external pressure (terraforming schedule) rather than protagonist agency—the "outlast" action is passive, missing a pivotal micro-choice that would heighten the trade-off under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hourglass sand grain’s reprise and final photograph, reweighting "outlast the dawn" as bittersweet preservation without moralizing. The dawnlit summit image crystallizes the conceptual cost of progress versus memory, avoiding abstraction through concrete lunar specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical details ("chemical reaction on the module’s surface") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. No POV slippage, though the communicator’s intrusion slightly disrupts the lyrical flow without purposeful elision teaching this rupture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("dawnlit melancholy" repetition) and a scaffold sentence ("The weight of her task pressed on her, but her purposefully curious nature drove her forward") dull momentum. Otherwise, sentence propulsion and specificity ("silvery glow of the stars") support the Accumulative lens without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar preservation with intimate mentor legacy avoids Apollo nostalgia tropes. The chemical message method transforms a familiar "timed clue" device through scientific plausibility, though the emotional arc risks generic melancholy without deeper moral ambiguity in the terraforming conflict.</comment>
