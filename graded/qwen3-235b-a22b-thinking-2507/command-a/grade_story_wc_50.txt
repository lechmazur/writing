<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract ("store wonder") lacks contradictory impulses in scene; embodied cost arrives only at closure. Final choice earned but prior interiority stays conceptual rather than sensorially rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure with felt cost ("fragile, like first snowflake"), but "wounded season" timeframe lacks active pressure despite lyrical description. Orientation solid; accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marble cavern setting vivid but functions decoratively; fails 9+ gate as environment doesn't constrain choices (e.g., timer repair could occur anywhere). Silver/gold veins and reflections charge final image yet don't shape tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("capture echoes for future wonder") signaled early with meaningful deepening, but pressure lacks tangible escalation—Elias never faces concrete failure risk. Agency clear yet cost remains abstract until final image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "harvest of echoes" metaphor, culminating in resonant non-literal answer ("warm like sunlight, fragile like snowflake"). Avoids moralizing but secondary "wounded season" concept dilutes focus slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," reflection angles) creates immersive voice. Rhythmic control shines in gear-repair sequences; minor register drift in "cellar of reason" phrase avoids full 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in key beats: "peripherally focused" repetition (para 1) and stacked metaphors ("warm like sunlight... fragile like snowflake") create density issues. Filter-verb clusters in high-pressure scenes (-0.5 cap) prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echo harvest" concept through tactile timer mechanics avoids trope. Bold risk in accumulative structure heightens emotional truth, though "wounded season" framing edges toward cliché without sufficient transformation.</comment>
