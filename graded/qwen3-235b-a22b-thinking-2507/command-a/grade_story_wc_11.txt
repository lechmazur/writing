<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; "thoughts unraveling" is abstract embodiment. Micro-choices absent during climax where stakes peak. Motivation clear but closure choice lacks visible cost beyond internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (thoughts as "bridge" replacing mystery), but loop mechanics remain vague. Orientation solid early. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through music-driven density shifts, though timeline "unfolding" lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard constrains choice (fragile violin handling) and charges final image (silence "filled with echo"). Twilight’s "surreal glow" mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Sensory details selective and POV-rooted ("cobblestones," "metallic fingers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, but escalation relies on program exposition rather than protagonist agency. Music-driven deepening reweights knowledge, yet cost remains abstract ("quiet certainty") without tangible trade-off. Pressure coherent but tightening lacks felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment>Theme emerges through "mundane mysticism" (janitor seeking transcendence) with final image reweighting cobblestones/silence. Avoids moralizing but "vast interconnected web" risks abstraction. Epiphany earned via violin’s physicality yet secondary stake (purpose shift) underdeveloped in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensors detecting vibration," "refracting twilight") modulates with emotional intensity. Voice consistent under pressure; no head-hopping. Minor register drift in "amalgamate" exposition, but lyric compression taught early via sensory verbs ("hum," "pulse").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thoughts unraveling like threads" is sole borderline metaphor. High density ("twilight deepening into surreal glow" advances setting/emotion). Final line’s "echo that would never fade" recharges opening silence without muddle. Slight overwriting in "tapestry" simile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitorial mundanity with cosmic inquiry avoids trope clichés. Emotional specificity in robot’s "depth to its calm" transcends genre. However, "second chance program" framing feels derivative; risks not heightening stakes sufficiently despite coherent vision.</comment>
