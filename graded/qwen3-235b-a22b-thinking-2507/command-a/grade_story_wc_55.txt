<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "heart beat to a different tempo" versus clock rhythm, but the backstory reflection block slightly exceeds BRR limits without sufficient micro-choice anchoring in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "carry it with her" realization, but the "bear" whisper introduction lacks sufficient causal buildup, weakening the escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (cage/cradle shift) and charges the final "home" image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement through the crystals' evolving role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through the clock repair action, but pressure relies slightly on external catalyst (crystals) rather than fully protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the clock repair as reconciliation metaphor; "home" whisper delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translucent stones hum with secrets") shows rhythmic control, but "soundless sanctuary" opening slightly contradicts later crystal whispers, creating minor POV coherence dip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with "glacial hush" motif reweighting meaning, but "excruciatingly gentle" repetition in adjacent beats triggers minor scaffold penalty (-0.2) without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock scribe profession with emotional constraint; "bear" twist transforms expected command into internal reckoning, meeting risk-distinction bonus criteria.</comment>
