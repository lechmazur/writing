<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("shape new dawn") but "shadowed elation" reads as diagnostic label-speak during climax without embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (panic/curiosity) shown, yet emotional progression lacks layered irrationality; laughter shifts feel narratively convenient rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when beings bow and declare "You have steered us home," crystallizing the Herald's role with conceptual cost (abandoning ordinary existence). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and pattern breaks (beam's rebellion, fog's pulse)—but the sea's "unnatural rhythm" introduction lacks causal setup, slightly muddying escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse beam functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: total internal reflection mechanics enable steering the fog gateway, charging the final green dawn image. Sensory details (shimmering wick, rippling sea) filter through the Herald's urgency, avoiding tourist-catalog syndrome while evolving causally with the beam's rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. cosmic purpose) tightens when the beam veers east, forcing the Herald's choice to steer deeper into fog. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (grasping wick, directing beam), but the sea's initial "unnatural rhythm" feels coincidental rather than earned pressure under Accumulative lens, slightly diluting cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wick's duality (ancient shadows/new dawn), culminating in the green dawn's "ethereal" light—a resonant, non-literal answer to "shaping dawn." Avoids moralizing, but "work far from over" edges toward thematic echo; saved by the beings' bow charging closure with earned ambiguity about the Herald's sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("beam slicing like a sword," laughter as "battle cry") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor flaw: "voices a chorus of gratitude" momentarily slips into omniscient summary, but overall voice control is exemplary—lyric compression taught early ("winds outside") pays off in the fog gateway's charged imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shaping the past into the future with every turn") with propulsion. One overwriting risk: "laughter carried an edge of shadowed elation" uses label-speak, but redeemed within 3 lines by embodied action (peering at fog). Final line’s cadence shift ("more storms to laugh at...") crystallizes momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through the wick’s physics-poetry fusion and "shadowed elation" tone. Risk-taking (cosmic beings emerging from fog) feels inevitable due to wick’s established magic, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The green dawn’s "ethereal" hue offers a fresh inflection on rebirth narratives, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
