<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation to illuminate the mundane, but lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle; epiphany feels unearned without prior tension in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (sharing reckonings) lacks legible cost; "hope" reconfiguration feels abstract without tangible sacrifice—no on-page sentence concretely shows paid price for the stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism, ripples, and mist function as micro-setting charging the final image; sensory details (dawn light on water, prism facets) are purposeful and constrain Elias' communion method, elevating beyond postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("shift coming") remain abstract; escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than protagonist-driven pressure—no narrowing of options or trade-off that alters tactics with visible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes ("hope that even in the face of change...") with explicit thematic echo, violating earned resonance; insights feel detached from Elias' struggle rather than emerging from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/water observation; rhythmic control under pressure avoids loops. Minor register drift when "noctilucent reckonings" intrudes as conceptual jargon without character-specific embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong textural specificity, but "noctilucent reckonings" functions as stock jargon in peak beats—elevated diction clashes with glazier POV lexicon, dulling immediacy in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light physics and epiphany avoids cliché, but emotional safety-hedging (no genuine risk in Elias' clarity) prevents bold risk-taking; specificity in prism/ripples rescues from template contemplation.</comment>
