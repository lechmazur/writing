<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eli’s micro-choices (trembling fingers, blowing the disc) concretely embody his contradiction between fear and purpose. Final dialing decision earns his shift from "cultivated estrangement" but the concept stays abstract without earlier tactical manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Eli’s "ready to begin" crystallizes stance shift with visible cost in "estrangement... began to dissolve." Accumulative pressure tightens through call patterns without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tunnel’s hum and condensation constrain action (acoustic resonance for disc, shrinking walls during climax). Final image of grates filtering light charges closure but lacks earlier tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Loneliness vs connection stake tightens via accumulating calls, each narrowing Eli’s options until dialing becomes inevitable. Cost (dissolved estrangement) is felt in final posture shift, driven by his agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Teaching endings how to begin" emerges through disc’s evolving use, never stated outright. Final warm disc humming charges theme with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing while reweighting "cultivated estrangement" as unsustainable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Eli notices rust streaks and condensation as emotional metaphors. "Cultivated estrangement" phrasing slightly over-tells, but rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure (staccato sentences during calls).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor cliché ("loneliness gnawed like damp air") and one synonym loop ("faint grooves that seemed to shimmer... shimmer when held"). No closure artifacts; final line’s "glass disc humming softly" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted phone booth" trope via specific mechanics: wrong numbers as time loops, harmonica as temporal bridge. Tunnel setting slightly generic but disc’s "melodically haunted" function feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
