<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("wavelength align with purpose") remains abstract; "quietly enthusiastic" trait lacks embodied contradiction beyond surface trembling. No visible trade-offs with her coin-casting role, weakening micro-choices under pressure despite clear goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (emotional transformation from "quietly enthusiastic" to "beacon of hope"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the distillation climax encounters no resistance, muting pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambered glass and coins charge the final image ("beacon of hope in ambered expanse"), but setting remains static backdrop; no environmental constraint alters Lira's tactics during distillation, missing micro-setting opportunity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering prophecy) signaled early, but pressure accumulation lacks visceral cost—distillation succeeds smoothly without narrowing options. The emotional shift feels earned yet insufficiently tied to tangible stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stellar doubt" reweights into "quiet certainty" via the distilled essence’s shifting images. Final line’s "beacon of hope" resonates without moralizing, crystallizing the cost of rebirth from cosmic contraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered observatory," "static bursts") modulates perfectly under pressure—sentences tighten during distillation climax. No head-hopping; rhythm shifts from deliberate dials to resonant light bursts sustain Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("her movements deliberate as she prepared") and slight logic strain ("deafening and silent" static burst) mar otherwise propulsive prose. Final line’s "ambered expanse" delivers crystalline closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic decay and personal purpose avoids cliché; "backwards prophecy" transforms through Lira’s tactile coin submersion. Emotional specificity in seeking meaning amid entropy elevates beyond genre tropes.</comment>
