<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("sorrow had lingered") over embodied contradiction; "sturdy brittle" tone feels clinical, not lived. No visible micro-choices under pressure—she subsumes remorse effortlessly, undermining stakes. Over-tidy resolution lacks genuine struggle with her gift's burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost: pavilion dissolves, dawn arrives, "a piece of her own sorrow" gone. But lens ambiguity past midpoint—shifts from quest (causal) to sensory accumulation—triggers -0.4 penalty. Orientation strong (desert fortress anchored by 120 words).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly realized but fails 9+ gate: desert fortress and coral pavilion don't constrain choices or charge final image (dawn is generic). "Damp sand" and tidal pools add texture but no tactical pressure—environment remains observational backdrop, not active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes lack escalation under accumulative lens: remorse absorption follows identical pattern each time with no rising cost or tactical shift. "Jagged etching" moment offers tension but no trade-off; she succeeds effortlessly. Agency isn't tested—pavilion's pressure never forces adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's physicality: remorse as crystallized emotion dissolving into "cleansed" dawn. Final image reweights "unspoken dreams" without moralizing—cost is felt in "a piece of her own sorrow" gone. Avoids sentimentality by making remorse actively contagious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "palate could taste memories," algae patterns traced "with precision of a cartographer." Filter verbs ("she felt lighter") dull immediacy in closure beat, but rhythmic control under pressure ("remorse flooded her... tears welled") elevates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" is mixed metaphor; "frosted with ice, glowing faintly" has redundant modifiers. Near-closure tells ("her work complete") rather than shows. No loops, but minor figurative muddle in high-pressure beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Memory-tasting chef transforms "remorse as physical substance" trope through tidal pool navigation and coral dissolution. Risky lyric structure pays off, but pavilion concept echoes *Pan's Labyrinth*-esque emotional landscapes—fresh inflection lacks transformative specificity for 9+.</comment>
