<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias sanctifying objects while being displaced himself, with embodied cost in the key's transformation. "Inadvertently profound" told rather than shown early weakens setup. Micro-choice at the rock crystallizes his hierarchy of values through tactile ritual. Flaw: "creeping normality noticer" feels like a label not lived experience until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("world felt a little more alive" implying eternal displacement). Accumulative lens holds through object-density escalation. Shard's glow slightly convenient—coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, triggering -0.8 cap. Cost proof solid: final image makes hush's burden undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bay functions as micro-setting: flat rock enables the sanctification ritual, and "shard's hush" charges the final image. Sensory details (whispering winds, rusted key) reflect Elias's priorities without tourist cataloging. Misses 9+ gate by hair—water's quiet constrains but doesn't actively pressure his choices during the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency: collecting objects transforms abstract curiosity into tangible ritual with felt cost (embracing perpetual displacement). Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens as object pile grows, narrowing his path to sanctification. Final image crystallizes the price—"whispering stories he was now ready to hear" forecloses normal silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through displaced objects' transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final line ("sanctifying the forgotten") resonates non-literally with the central question. Slight tell in "inadvertently profound" weakens integration, but shard's hush reweights "alive houses" as active listening. No thematic echo—wisdom earned through tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "creeping normality noticer" filters all observations ("streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). Rhythmic control varies from lyrical ("soft hues of dawn") to clipped ("He turned the shard"). Minor register drift in "inadvertently profound" but quickly grounded in action. Zero head-hopping; compression serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose flows with high density—"rusted key no longer seemed discarded but purposeful" does triple duty. One scaffold: "Elias was inadvertently profound" abstractly tells rather than shows. Final line ("sanctifying the forgotten") avoids loops with strong verbs. Minor overwriting in "hushed blaze" compensated by payoff in closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in sanctifying displacement rather than fixing it—transformed trope through orris shard specificity. Emotional truth in Elias accepting eternal listening as purpose. "Creeping normality noticer" slightly tropey but redeemed by concrete object ritual. Risk-taking with quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry; bay's hush anchors universals.</comment>
