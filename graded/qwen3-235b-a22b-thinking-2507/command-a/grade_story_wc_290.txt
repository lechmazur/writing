<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through claustrophobia vs. determination during passage squeeze, but "prudently adventurous" remains label-only with no tradeoff cost; emotional resolution ("fears into strength") feels tidily rational without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure as chamber transforms with visible cost (claustrophobia's "vengeance"), but lens ambiguity: starts causal (compass guiding) then shifts to accumulative without teaching pattern by midpoint, weakening escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: compass constrains choices during narrow passage and charges final image ("needle pointed toward stars"); "ancient stone" scent and shifting symbols anchor atmosphere through action, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as claustrophobia wars with discovery drive during passage, with visceral cost ("shoulders brushing walls"), but spatial mutiny's rules remain abstract—pressure grows through sensory density rather than concrete constraint changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spatial mutiny" as liberation metaphor, reweighted in final image where chamber expands; avoids moralizing but "wistful rebellion" label slightly undermines earned ambiguity in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "needle quivering as if alive" and "pulse in her veins"; rhythmic control intensifies during chamber sequence, though "wistful rebellion" slips into abstract register under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until final paragraph where filter-verb stack ("she realized... her heart pounding... she reached") dulls immediacy; "pulse in her veins" cliché mars high-pressure beat but closure image ("needle pointed toward stars") remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia and spatial mutiny creates emotional specificity; "compass merging with shard" transforms trope, but "lonely church organ" echoes common melancholy motifs without sufficient reconfiguration.</comment>
