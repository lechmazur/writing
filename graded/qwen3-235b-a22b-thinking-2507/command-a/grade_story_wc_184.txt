<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear but interiority lacks struggle. "Warmly methodical" shown through precise actions yet no visible trade-offs during braiding. Final choice (stepping through) lacks earned cost—discovery weight remains abstract. Strong embodiment in "fingers brushing knots" but missing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (stories now "waiting to be told"), but "heart pounding" lacks specificity to prove cost. Accumulative lens holds through rope vibration density, though door transition feels coincidental rather than earned. No persistent constraint shapes tactics—braiding succeeds without setbacks. Cost proof insufficient for high-band despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (rope fibers, brass lamp) vividly anchors urgency, with gears clicking as emotional barometer. But tower mechanics never constrain choices—rope exists independently rather than forcing adaptation. Final "sanctuary" image charges setting, yet no tactical pressure from environment during climax. Misses 9+ gate as tools don’t alter tactics despite strong sensory economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("translate confusion into clarity"), escalation through textural density (seal labyrinth → rope hum). But protagonist agency passive: realization ("symbols matched") drives action, not active problem-solving. No narrowing of options or trade-offs—braiding proceeds unimpeded. Conceptual cost (burden of uncovered stories) felt but not dramatized through on-page forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Fables of absence" evolves from "whispers" to "stories waiting to be told," reweighting loss as responsibility without moralizing. Final image crystallizes theme through "harmonious chimes," avoiding sentimentality. Near-miss on thematic echo: "proving complex truths could be unraveled" edges toward abstraction but redeemed by concrete artifacts. Earned resonance through seal/rope symbiosis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears clicking in rhythm with her thoughts") modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "testament to centuries of craftsmanship" clashes with archivist POV. No dialogue, but internal voice maintains rhythmic control—"tapestry of connections" apt for scholar. Overwriting in "beacon of clarity" slightly dilutes final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("frayed fibers," "brass lamp glow") but "holding weight of centuries" is stock phrase. Template cadence in dual "She knew..." sentences near midpoint. Final paragraph’s "proving... truths could be unraveled" over-explains. No closure artifacts, yet minor synonym churn ("confusion into clarity"/"unraveled with patience") limits high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist protagonist with clockwork mysticism—rope braids as textual cipher avoids trope. Emotional truth in quiet triumph over "whispers in the wind." Risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates, though "diplomat’s seal" feels generic. Transformation test passed: removing university specificity would neuter the stakes’ academic melancholy.</comment>
