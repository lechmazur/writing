<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" verge on label-speak; the chipped die's loss forces authentic contradiction between holding/letting go with embodied cost in the final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (weaving loss into motion) with felt cost, but Accumulative/Textural lens isn't fully taught until the die slips; mid-story ambiguity slightly weakens causal legibility for escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The staircase functions as perfect micro-setting: its geometry actively constrains choice (can't retrieve the die) and the final "boundless confinement" image charges closure with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from capturing memory to embracing impermanence; the die slip forces agency via the solitary roll of "three," narrowing options while the staircase's shifting walls intensify pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the dice's texture and staircase's pulse reconfigure "perpetual motion" as philosophical endurance, avoiding moralizing while the final whisper acknowledges journey over outcome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equations etched in fading chalk," "sound like distant thunder") modulates under pressure, though "grim optimist" momentarily disrupts voice coherence in early exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No fatal artifacts; lyrical density ("breath steady despite the weight") propels momentum, but "balancedly daring" is an awkward, unearned phrase that slightly muddles a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mathematical melancholy through specific, irreplaceable details (chipped die's history, staircase's living walls); risk-taking in abstract stakes pays off via embodied closure without gimmickry.</comment>
