<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s blindness as a lens for machine-soul perception avoids stereotype; micro-choices during repair (fingers hovering, decoding feedback) reveal contradictory impulses (calm/focus vs. relentless renewal drive). Traveler interaction lacks depth but single-POV focus on embodied emotion (hummingbird’s flicker as tactile dialogue) earns high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "her work was far from over" crystallizes cost of perpetual renewal under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mist thickening and anchor lifting deepen density without causality breaks; cost proof solid in final lines where renewal promise implies emotional exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water features constrain choice (light refraction guides repair) and charge closure ("mist curled around her" reweights renewal). Depot’s mist and rhythmic clatter evolve causally with ship’s departure, avoiding static description; micro-setting as environment meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via anchor’s ascent—cheer erupts as drone revives, forcing crystallization of Elara’s stance (repair as trust mending). Cost unmistakable: "every patch a chance to begin again" shows conceptual price of endless labor under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through drone’s rebirth and ship’s departure; final image ("mist curled around her") offers non-literal answer to renewal’s cost without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars (frayed wires, water patterns) reweighting "soul within silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: blindness shapes noticing (sound of machinery, light refraction as "whisper"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("wings beating in perfect rhythm") avoids lyric drift; voice modulates from depot’s "murmur" to focused silence during repair.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "her methodical hands disassembling it piece by piece" shows without telling. Minor cadence hiccup in "mosaic of glass and liquid" description, but closure beat ("mist curled around her") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness as perceptual advantage (light refraction as repair tool) avoids tropes. Emotional specificity in "magnetic calm" amid depot chaos heightens stakes; risk-taking in sensory POV feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
