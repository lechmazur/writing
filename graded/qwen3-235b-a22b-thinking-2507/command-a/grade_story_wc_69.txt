<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("traveled stillness," "unlearning hatred") with diagnostic phrasing; embodied contradictions in Elara's resolve lack dramatization despite strong motivation. Students remain underdeveloped props.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("true victory lay not in applause, but in the silence they had replaced") with conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity (causal vs. accumulative) past midpoint prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet library functions as micro-setting: rosette's tangible glow during humming constrains choices and charges the final image. Autumn light/scent evolve with emotional shifts without static postcardism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through "subtracting noise" method, but escalation isn't clearly driven by Elara's agency—the choir's growth feels convenient rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final image ("vanishing arts were not lost—they were waiting") reweights premise without moralizing. Rosette's transformation from loss-symbol to beacon avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice drifts into abstract jargon ("unlearning hatred," "traveled stillness") during peak tension, undermining perceptual specificity. Lyrical rhythm falters when lexicon exceeds Elara's plausible voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" and "unlearning hatred" constitute diagnostic label-speak in high-pressure beats (-0.5). No loops, but abstract phrasing dulls closure’s immediacy despite otherwise clean prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "subtracting noise" as artistic resistance transforms vanishing arts trope. Risks lyrical structure successfully, though "velvet library" borders on safety-hedged cliché.</comment>
