<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (cracked yet holding light) and blood sacrifice reveal character under pressure, but "doubt crept in" slightly abstracts emotion during crisis without immediate embodied reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mended puppet and steady beam crystallize options with felt cost (blood, acknowledged fragility), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through atmospheric intensification to final whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and blood-dripped shard constrain choices (spiral arrangement, sacrifice) and charge the final image; dusk-to-violet progression mirrors emotional arc without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through atmospheric pressure (heavier hush, stuttering beam) and blood sacrifice; single reversal (patterns glowing) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but cost could be more viscerally tied to the puppet's repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "beautifully flawed" motif reweighted by mended puppet's fragility; avoids moralizing but "bruised awe" final line risks slight thematic echo without deeper conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("pane of hush," "tone of bruised awe") reflects Elara's ritual focus; rhythmic control intensifies during blood sacrifice, though "doubt crept in" momentarily drifts from embodied POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "doubt crept in" is near-label abstraction in high-pressure beat; otherwise high density with concrete verbs ("shuddering," "trembled") charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday clock with puppet-mending ritual feels inevitable; risk-taking (abstract stakes made visceral through blood/silence) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
