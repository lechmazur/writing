<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks embodied micro-choices; "layers of naivety/fear" triggers therapy-speak penalty (-0.4) in peak beat without immediate cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility falters: "fragility/strength" epiphany lacks concrete on-page price (e.g., no physical tremor or tool-rearrangement consequence).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cedar/earth scents and tail tip constrain reflection, but starlight/mist remain atmospheric rather than tactical; final image charged yet environment doesn't alter choices (e.g., no obscured vision affecting actions).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; "shedding layers" method isn't tested through action, reducing cost immediacy despite strong thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Theme emerges cleanly through chameleon metaphor, but final "fragility/strength" line risks thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet conceptual cost lacks visceral grounding in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (avian/scale details) shines, though reflection-heavy sections dilute psychic distance control; lyric compression taught early pays off in Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>"Layers of naivety/fear" therapy-speak in para 3 and paraphrase loops ("reconstruct pieces... reconstruct understanding") trigger -1.1 penalty; filter-verb stack ("she felt... she recalled... she thought") dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Fresh synthesis of wildlife handling with emotional rebirth, but "shimmering stillness" trope lacks transformation; specificity in creature interactions elevates beyond template yet safety-hedging in resolution limits risk.</comment>
