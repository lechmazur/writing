<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (loneliness vs purpose-seeking) drives change, but transformation feels slightly neat; micro-choices lack visceral friction in pivotal archway moment where cost isn't embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: chip→ants→cavern→archway creates clean escalation. Earned Stasis closure lands with felt cost (end of loneliness) via decision-state crystallization at "maps now seemed alive with possibility".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Matrix chip functions as micro-setting object that charges final image; bioluminescent cavern’s glow constrains Elias’s navigation. Creek’s rise lacks active pressure despite early setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs directionlessness) tightens through archway crossing, but mystical vision resolves conflict externally. Cost (end of loneliness) is legible though not viscerally paid in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shifting map line and "doorway of decisions" concept. Final image reweights maps as "alive with possibility" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobblestone streets whispered tales") and rhythmic control shine. Minor register drift in "empirically intuitive" momentarily distances voice during high-pressure discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with strong propulsion; "creek’s waters had begun to recede" recharges opening motif. Slight overwriting in "sanctuary of faded parchment and crumbling atlases" borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic magic realism with decision theory. Emotional specificity in map dealer’s transformation elevates trope, though guardian lineage feels slightly conventional.</comment>
