<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Embodied trauma shines (somatic markers, muscle tension) but "quietly talented" remains abstract label without prior constraint. Final choice lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned by specific struggle. Diagnostic phrase "somatic markers" triggers Q1 anti-pattern penalty mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (smiling at ocean with cost "not healed, not entirely"), but escalation relies on coincidence (wind stealing photo) not character agency. "Pearl of stillness" realization lacks causal buildup; single tightening insufficient under Accumulative lens for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arboretum functions as micro-setting: cliff edge physically constrains choice during photo retrieval, jasmine/ocean scents mirror internal state. Final image charged by recurring photograph. Overuse of "pearl" motif slightly dilutes environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. carrying pain) signaled early, single deepening (cliff slip) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost ("weight lift") visible but soft; agency undermined by wind coincidence. Band guardrail blocks 8.8+ due to missing tangible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photograph/artistry particulars, but "pearl of stillness" becomes thematic echo. Final line's explicit "resilience of the human spirit" triggers Q5 penalty for moralizing. Avoids sentimentality yet lacks meaningful ambiguity in resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (artistic noticing) shines, but stress-response diction turns clinical ("somatic markers", "muscles tense"). Uniform cadence in high-pressure beats ("She took... Her eyes fixed...") weakens rhythmic control. No POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity (crumpled photo, loose stone) but adjacent paraphrase loops ("fragility of life"/"world that had shattered"). Template cadence in cliff scene ("She took... Her eyes fixed...") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty. No closure-beat muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drone strike survivor trope feels derivative without fresh angle, but arboretum-as-lighthouse-legacy offers ingenuity. Emotional truth in grief-to-art journey avoids generic templates yet lacks bold risk-taking. Derivative premise guardrail caps potential.</comment>
