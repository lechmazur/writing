<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("serene anger") lacks embodied contradiction in climax; brother backstory anchors motivation but final transformation feels slightly rushed without visible struggle during revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost (accepting grief), but drone's role in escalation is underdeveloped; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with density increase at ink revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment creates atmosphere but doesn't constrain choices; drone functions as effective micro-setting charging the final image with its return to wrist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding brother's death) tightens through ink's revelation, but Elara's agency feels passive during the critical turn; cost is emotional but lacks tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "understanding over control" emerges organically through ink's function and final horizon image; avoids moralizing while charging the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("consciously wild intensity," drone observations) modulates under pressure, but "serene anger" phrasing verges on abstract labeling in key beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding ("anger burned deep within her" tells rather than shows); final paragraph's "testament to power" slightly overwrites, dulling the earned image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-manipulation trope through disappearing ink's reflective function; albino trait adds specificity but isn't deeply integrated into core conflict.</comment>
