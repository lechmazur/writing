<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("mend fragmented narratives") and closure choice earned, but interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; micro-choices (tracing vial) reveal values without layered irrationality at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (library awakening) lands with conceptual cost ("glow dimmed but purpose fulfilled"), but cost proof lacks visceral specificity; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in fragmentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass setting constrains choice (incising ledge) and charges final image ("stories floated, eternal"); micro-setting of vial’s glow directly enables climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (finding story origins) tighten through ascent, but escalation relies on environmental pressure over protagonist agency; cost (dimmed vial) legible yet emotionally abstract at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrated fragmentation emerges through blank book transformation without moralizing; final image reweights library’s meaning as "beacon of integrated tales," satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of ink and anticipation") with rhythmic control; voice modulates under pressure (ascent descriptions) and teaches pattern for lyric closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("glow" x3 in climax beats) and overwriting ("eternal and ever-changing") dull closure propulsion; high density otherwise, but artifacts prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library tropes via "glimmering parole" concept; emotional specificity in mending narratives avoids templates, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening coherence.</comment>
