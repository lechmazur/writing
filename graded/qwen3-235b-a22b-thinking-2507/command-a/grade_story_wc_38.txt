<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "calm defiance" consistent without internal struggle. Micro-choices visible in dance sequence yet no genuine trade-off between vulnerability/strength. Final endurance feels earned but cost remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with walls shifting, but cost proof fails—triumph lacks visible sacrifice. Orientation clear by paragraph 1, yet escalation under Accumulative lens stalls; dance climax resolves via coincidence (chamber hum) not protagonist agency. Lens ambiguity cap applies as drive shifts from causal to textural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken lab functions as micro-setting: dripping water pressures time, moss-covered surfaces constrain movement. Hangman’s dice charge final image ("silent in her hand") while laboratory’s shift directly alters tactics. Sensory details (decay scent, rustling clothes) filter through Elara’s mission without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating knowledge) signaled early but never tested concretely—no moment where failure seems possible. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; chamber anomaly appears coincidentally. "Surge of triumph" lacks felt cost as required for Accumulative lens, weakening pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dance/dice integration but final paragraph moralizing ("even in fragility, there is power") triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Conceptual repricing succeeds with dice as vulnerability-turned-strength, yet resolution oversimplifies complexity into symmetrical satisfaction. Earned wisdom diluted by abstract assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced," "rhythm of journal’s pages") modulates with emotional intensity. However, "lyrical code breaker" and "encrypt vulnerability" introduce corporate diction violating POV lexicon. Focalization stable but late thematic labels disrupt voice coherence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Final paragraph’s "even in fragility, there is power" is stock thematic echo triggering -0.8 artifact penalty. Synonym loops ("resurrect it, to breathe life into echoes") and elevated diction ("calm defiance had become a force") dull closure’s immediacy. Figurative muddle in dance climax harms propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance as cipher language transforms trope, with specificity in dice’s pulse aligning with movements. However, "spider completes its web" metaphor feels derivative. Risk-taking in embodied knowledge succeeds but safety-hedging in moral resolution ("light in depths") limits boldness.</comment>
