<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; childhood memory reflects but doesn't alter present tactics. Final change lacks embodied cost beyond vague "she had changed," though micro-choices during weaving show value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("fragile, fleeting, worth every risk"), but escalation falters—shadow figure's appearance feels coincidental, not driven by accumulated pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gallery setting constrains choice through responsive illusions (roots coiling forces fluid movements), and sinew thread charges the final image ("clutched in her hand"), meeting 9+ gate with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible price during weaving—risk of unraveling is stated but not dramatized through altered tactics until the tangle appears at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thread motif reweighting: final "fleeting but real" connection offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though "worth every risk" edges toward thematic echo but avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("light fractured into impossible angles"); syntax mirrors weaving rhythm. Zero head-hopping, with psychic distance tightening under stress ("her mind sharp despite feverish energy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loop in "memories alter, so too did the gallery" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise flawless density—"roots coiled upward like living vines" integrates action and setting without ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Fever dream architect" transforms trope through concrete sinew-thread mechanics, but "rational enchantment" feels underlived. Emotional specificity in "fleeting connection" avoids abstraction yet lacks one bold risk to elevate.</comment>
