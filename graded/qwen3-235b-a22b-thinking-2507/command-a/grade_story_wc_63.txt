<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in calloused hands and routine, but transformation lacks contradictory impulses; "searing reverie" risks therapeutic abstraction. Epiphany feels earned yet slightly convenient without visible struggle against his solitary nature during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "become the pendulum bob himself," cost legible in "incremental grace." Orientation anchors by word 20, but town transformation summarized (fisherman/baker) weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and pendulum constrain choices: tidal whispers mirror his incremental communication, pause moment enables epiphany. Final image recharges "whispered secrets" with undeniable cost, satisfying 9+ gate through micro-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency (carving, conversations), but lacks visible price paid—no trade-off like sacrificed winding time. Pressure accumulates cleanly under Accumulative lens, yet secondary stake (town fractures) feels underserved by single scene scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inscriptions’ evolution: "healing came not in leaps" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights "breath of time" into "incremental grace" without stated moral, nailing 9+ test through concrete resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly from precise routine ("calloused hands") to lyrical closure ("obsidian ridge glimmered"), with perceptual signature in tool-focused noticing. Minor register drift in "searing reverie" slightly detaches from character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whispered secrets to the stone" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-deduction for "reverie that pulled him toward something greater" bordering abstraction, but saved by concrete context in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "wise artisan" trope via broken rake inscriptions and tidal mechanics. Emotional specificity in "absolution not in grand gestures" avoids cliché, but hedging on solitary vs communal tension prevents full risk distinction bonus.</comment>
