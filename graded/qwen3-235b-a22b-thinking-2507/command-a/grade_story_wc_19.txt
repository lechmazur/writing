<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (suffocation vs freedom) drives choices, but "flavors of silence" motivation remains abstract without mid-story sensory testing; doll retrieval earns growth but lacks concrete cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise: "tasted true silence... set her free") lands with felt cost, but doll's "porcelain limbs stretching" creates minor causality friction in pivotal beat; orientation anchors immediately via "xenial trellis" and "bunker builder's claustrophobic child".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Doll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (climbing with it) and charges final image ("tasted true silence"); clouds/trellis details evolve causally with inversion, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (freedom vs gilded hush) tightens meaningfully: gravity inversion timeframe forces irreversible choice with visible cost (permanent internal shift); pressure escalates through Elara's agency alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silence's sensory reweighting ("symphony of nothingness"), but "gilded hush" concept lacks active constraint until climax; avoids moralizing yet secondary stake ("flavors of silence") remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("intangibly tangible freedom," "gilded hush") modulates with pressure; controlled psychic distance shifts during inversion, though "tone stretching contracted" feels like unmotivated abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor scaffold ("her chest tightening" repeated verbatim); "porcelain limbs stretching" creates micro-contradiction in high-pressure beat; final line ("tasted true silence... set her free") achieves resonant density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia/silence via doll motif; risk-taking (gravity inversion) heightens stakes coherently, but "xenial trellis" leans slightly on fantasy template without sufficient transformation.</comment>
