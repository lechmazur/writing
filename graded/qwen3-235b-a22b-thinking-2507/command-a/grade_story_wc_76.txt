<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interiority remains surface-level ambition without deeper conflict beyond "unease." Final choice earned but micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("tide rushed back in, swallowing exposed rocks"), causal chain holds tightly. Minor causality gap: why yoyo unlocks stone isn't dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse gears directly constrain choice (methodical dismantling) and charge final image (counter-clockwise rotation). Tide's physicality ("exposed rocks") creates irreversible stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Escalation driven by Elias' agency (dismantling → activation → transformation) with felt cost in "no going back." Island's resistance ("humming with energy") slightly vague but closure cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: counter-clockwise clocks → lighthouse transformation. Final image reweights "latent radiance" as dangerous without moralizing; "bleak exhilaration" crystallizes complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("oil-stained coat," "precision of clockmaker") modulates under pressure. Minor scaffold loop: "bleak exhilaration" repeated verbatim weakens rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("island seemed to sigh, its rocky spine exposed like ribs of ancient beast"). Paraphrase loop: "mind racing through the puzzle" followed by "mind already racing" dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms time-bending trope through tactile mechanics (yoyo/spiral patterns). "Counter-clockwise" detail essential to premise, but hunger stone concept slightly derivative despite fresh execution.</comment>
