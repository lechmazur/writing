<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete texture through photographs and maze design, but "texture of time" motivation remains abstract without embodied cost. Flaws (passive agency during transformation) complicate choices credibly, though the final "discovered herself" risks unearned epiphany. Micro-choices lack visible trade-offs during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fragment's dissolution), but the "discovered herself" resolution lacks tangible sacrifice. Orientation anchors early (120 words), yet Accumulative lens falters as pressure accumulates without narrowing Elara's options. Final image reconfigures meaning but cost remains felt rather than legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Garden setting vividly constrains choices through shifting hedges and hyperbolic geometry, charging the final image with restored clarity. Sensory details (damp earth, rustling leaves) filter through Elara's temporal obsession, avoiding white-room syndrome. However, the living bridge remains ornamental rather than actively shaping tactics beyond the maze sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) signals early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the maze's shifts feel externally imposed rather than testing Elara's choices. Cost (fragment's dissolution) is conceptual yet insufficiently visceral for the stakes. Pressure accumulates texturally but forecloses no live option with on-page trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through restored photographs and "texture of time," avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise via final image ("weave it into every maze"). Resonant ambiguity lingers in the conceptual cost of the fragment's loss, though "discovered herself" slightly undermines earned complexity. No thematic echo detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in botanical and temporal lexicon ("retrocognitive entrapment," "hyperbolic geometry"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in "quaking reverie" (diagnostic label-speak), but lyrical compression teaches its pattern early. Zero head-hopping; voice remains consistently Elara's.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" triggers overwriting penalty (-0.3) with therapy-speak in peak beat; "roots intertwined like ancient whispers" risks mixed metaphor. Otherwise strong propulsion and syntactic variety, but scaffold appears in "her mind drifted to... she had always been haunted by..." (synonym loop). Closure beat remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal mazes and ancestral memory avoids trope recycling through specific horticultural lens. Bold risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, yet "texture of time" concept edges toward abstraction without deeper transformation. Emotional truth in photograph motif elevates beyond surface novelty, resisting safety-middle choices.</comment>
