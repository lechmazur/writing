<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied craft ("calloused fingers," "luminescent ache") and contradictory impulses (craving connection while feeling like an outsider) drive her search. Final acceptance of belonging through active weaving—not grasping—earns closure with felt cost of years-long isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure where the marked sculpture crystallizes Lira’s shift from "untethered" to belonging. Cost is legible in "luminescent ache" softening to "quiet warmth," though escalation lacks one decisive intensification beyond tag discoveries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain choices (light refraction guides her sculpting; shifting patterns mirror fractured kinship). Final image of patterns shifting as she feels belonging charges closure—environment actively reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) tightens through Lira’s agency—her search reshapes tactics from solitary sculpting to weaving community stories. Cost ("luminescent ache" to "warmth") is felt but not visceral; escalation lacks narrowing of options beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Web of kinship" evolves from abstract yearning to actionable metaphor ("woven thread by thread"), culminating in non-literal closure: the marked sculpture reweights her journey without moralizing. Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars like reed sculptures echoing voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-like trees," "glimmering obsidian") filters urgency through Lira’s artistic lens. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats like the Echo encounter, slightly fracturing psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves rhythmic control ("sky bled into earth in hues of violet and gold") but suffers paraphrase loops: "luminescent ache" repeats with identical phrasing, and sequential "She" openings create drumbeat rhythm in the search montage, slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of street art and kinship rituals transforms "search for self" tropes. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry—the obsidian arbor’s shifting patterns make belonging feel earned, not sentimental.</comment>
