<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Witness lacks interior contradiction; motivation stated not dramatized. "Unravel cosmic illusions" remains abstract goal without embodied struggle or flawed execution under pressure, reducing change to passive revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: temple "trembled" but no on-page consequence for witness. Spiral arbitration resolution feels unearned as dictionary's glow-to-merge shift lacks causal pressure buildup; cosmic illusion dissolution occurs off-stage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Temple's shifting walls and fluid time effectively constrain choices (e.g., witness tracing mural lines), but cosmic scale overwhelms micro-setting. Dust-dancing light and dictionary's physicality charge the final image yet lack persistent tactical constraints earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("cosmic illusions") without concrete on-page tests. Witness's agency evaporates at climax—dictionary acts autonomously—violating "major turns result from protagonist’s decisions" rule; no visible price paid for unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of unity through spiral arbitration emerges implicitly via mural/dictionary integration, but "resounding hush" conclusion states the central question ("bridge between old and new") without resonant non-literal answer, risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent "wanderingly exact" perceptual signature (e.g., "footfall a deliberate act of exploration"), though cosmic scale dilutes POV plausibility. Tense stability and rhythmic control under pressure elevate despite abstract focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Seemed to pulse," "seemed to shimmer" filter-verb stacks dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("As they walked... As the final illusion dissolved...") creates repetitive stems, though lyrical density partially offsets scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Novel synthesis of "spiral arbitration" with cosmic unity avoids cliché, but temple/dictionary tropes lack fresh inflection. Risk-taking in conceptual closure is undermined by insufficient grounding in specific lived detail per transformation test.</comment>
