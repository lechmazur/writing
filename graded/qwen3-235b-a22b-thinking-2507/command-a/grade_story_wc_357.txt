<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks interior contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as Elara faces no meaningful struggle or flawed choices. No visible cost to her "resilience" beyond abstract future burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) works with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks causal narrowing—Elara’s success relies on tool functionality rather than earned tactical shifts. "Journey far from over" feels stated, not viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (bioluminescent moss, gravity inversion) create atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices. River flow guides navigation yet lacks tactical pressure; final image resonates without prior environmental causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save planet) is clear, but pressure doesn’t escalate under Causal lens—Elara follows the arrow tip without trade-offs. Cost remains abstract future burden ("journey far from over") rather than dramatized present sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through echoes, but final paragraph explicitly states "source of resilience... for herself," triggering thematic echo penalty. Resonant image ("planet’s song") is undermined by moralizing abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (pilot’s organic observations) shines, but voice lacks stress modulation—lyrical cadence remains uniform during gravity inversion crisis, missing compression under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding ("mission was clear... she knew she was close") and generic phrasing ("heart raced") prevent 9.0. No closure-dulling artifacts, but overwriting in "delicate balance between life and chaos" slightly muddles final charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion and plant-memory echoes avoids tropes, but emotional complexity lacks depth—Elara’s transformation feels smooth rather than earned through specific struggle against her own flaws.</comment>
