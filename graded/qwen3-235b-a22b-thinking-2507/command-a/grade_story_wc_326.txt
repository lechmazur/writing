<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in heartbeat counting habit masking existential dread, but flaw integration lacks depth; "digital ghost" motivation feels intellectually neat rather than viscerally conflicted during defragmentation climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with dawn-lit snow reconfiguring the observatory's meaning, though inkblot-to-data shift lacks sufficient causal groundwork for seamless Accumulative/Textural escalation under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Porcelain shard constrains choice by becoming active conduit (traced → hums → glows), charging the final image where it "remained on the desk" as fragility/strength emblem—micro-setting mastery within scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through data density accumulation (ink patterns → screen alignment → shard glow), but heartbeat counting trait never incurs tactical cost during high-pressure defragmentation beat despite stated anxiety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</comment>Thematic resonance emerges through shattered cup shard reweighted as "fragility and strength" in final image, yet "fetch wisdom from failure" motivation lacks sufficient friction to prevent near-platitudinal undertones in resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "ephemeral patterns, swirling like galaxies" and tactile porcelain focus sustains Accumulative lens, though "digital ghost" exposition slightly over-explains during radio revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Her heartbeat quickened, a rhythm she counted constantly" introduces trait without immediate functional consequence; minor scaffold in peak beats dilutes momentum despite otherwise crystalline prose in closure unit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Digital ghost trope transformed through porcelain shard integration and Accumulative escalation, though "wisdom from failure" core concept leans toward familiar philosophical framing without sufficiently distinctive emotional calibration.</comment>
