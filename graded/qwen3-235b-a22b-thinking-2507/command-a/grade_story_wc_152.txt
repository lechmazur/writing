<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction (reaching for dagger while weaving) reveals hierarchy of values; Lira’s underdeveloped motivation slightly undermines secondary pressure despite strong micro-choices like hovering needle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (mentor silenced/severed connection), but cost proof lacks visceral legibility; "adjacent possibilities" resolution strains accumulative lens coherence at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: embroidery tools and eternal flame constrain choices (dagger in boot, chart guiding path); autumn atmosphere enriches but doesn’t pressure tactics enough for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through knowledge reweighting (flame as safeguard), but escalation relies on Lira’s exposition rather than Elara’s agency; conceptual cost feels earned yet insufficiently embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final line ("unravel the truth, one stitch at a time") crystallizes theme through concrete action without moralizing; cosmic stakes avoid sentimentality via embroidery motif’s consistent reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sensory selection (thread tension, flame pulse), but "adjacent possibilities" phrasing slightly violates Elara’s lexicon during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong textural density with minimal loops; "conspiracies were like knots" mixed metaphor slightly muddles physics, but final image avoids overwriting with resonant simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery and cosmic stakes elevates tropes; emotional specificity in quiet resolve avoids generic rebellion narratives while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
