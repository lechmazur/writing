<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs inherited belief) drives choices, but "restless need to appraise" veers into diagnostic label-speak; recklessness lacks concrete manifestation beyond cautious movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight lift"), but "sense of peace" abstracts the emotional charge; Causal lens holds yet cost proof lacks visceral embodiment in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (clutching it during whispers) and charging closure; sensory details (damp earth, grime-encrusted beads) reflect urgency and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-seeking) tightens via valve wheel discovery, but escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven choices; whispers-to-screams shift lacks tactical consequence for Mara.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "swallowed truth" motif reweighted by closure, but "sense of peace" risks sentimentality; avoids moralizing yet final image leans slightly toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("jagged shards," "rhythmic clanking") modulates with stress; rhythmic control peaks in chamber discovery ("Gears hung mid-turn, belts draped like cobwebs").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density, but "spectral figures" metaphor borders cliché in climax; "weight lift" closure image slightly over-tells emotion where embodied detail would elevate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore with grief, yet "factory ghost shift" trope remains recognizable; specificity (beaded valve wheel, talk-radio psychics) prevents derivative feel but lacks bold structural risk.</comment>
