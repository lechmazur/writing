<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (scheming yet pacifist), but "releasing resentment" borders on therapy-speak in peak beat, risking diagnostic label penalty; Kael’s embodied resistance ("shoulders sagging") saves from deeper deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds; closure as Charged Poise ("How do I start?") carries felt cost via Kael’s raw voice and sagging shoulders; sanctuary mechanics slightly convenient but payoff in pin symbolism salvages causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Music box pin functions as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging final image ("broken pin a symbol of what could be mended"); sensory selectivity strong but river memory lacks tactile specificity to fully elevate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s cellular memory technique; Kael’s shift from scoffing to asking "How do I start?" shows protagonist-driven escalation under hybrid lens; cost legible in his "raw" voice and lifted burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pin’s evolving symbolism ("grace shifts, it changes"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights brokenness as hope without stating moral, fulfilling CR requirements with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint hum of shifting realities"), dialogue carries subtext ("That thing’s broken. Just like everything else"); minor register drift in "cellular memory" exposition slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; high density ("sanctuary shifted once more, its purpose fulfilled") but "fractured but not beyond repair" slightly clichéd; propulsion flawless despite one weak modifier ("glimmer of hope").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "scheming pacifist" via cellular memory persuasion; transforms resentment trope through tangible object (pin) and shifting grace concept; avoids safety middle with Kael’s raw vulnerability.</comment>
