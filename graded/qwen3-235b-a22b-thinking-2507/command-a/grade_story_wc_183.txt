<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation for recapturing loss is clear but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; Lyra's "mirror" revelation feels abstract rather than lived, with "blissfully aberrant" used as label without concrete tradeoffs during pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "chimera twin discoverer" profession remains unanchored past 120 words, muddying stakes; closure (Charged Poise stepping through door) has felt cost but emerald card's glow guiding her reads as coincidence not earned escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: ship's narrative threads constrain Elara's choice to weave stories, and decaying carnival mechanics charge the final garden image; fog/thick air concretely pressures navigation toward the mist door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: reading threads deepens knowledge, leading to Lyra's voice tightening options; cost ("for the first time, she felt whole") legible at climax. Vagueness of "what was lost" slightly weakens pressure coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ship's "trapped freedom" becoming garden's "embracing flaws" realization; final blooming names image reweights decay without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "unkindled solace" risks abstraction without sufficient tactical manifestation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of saltwater and decay," rusted textures) consistent under pressure, but climax diction doesn't compress ("state of being... embrace unkindled solace") despite high stakes; no dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax beat: dense abstraction ("a state of being... blissfully aberrant") dulls closure image; template cadence ("She followed... She sat...") in thread-reading sequence triggers -0.4 deduction despite strong atmospheric prose elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival ship as memory repository avoids cliché; emotional truth in twin loss resonates. Derivative edge in "garden of forgotten names" premise slightly offsets risk-taking in Accumulative structure, capping near 8.5 threshold.</comment>
