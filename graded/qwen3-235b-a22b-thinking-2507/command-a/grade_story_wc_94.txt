<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied in map interaction, but motivation for censorship remains abstract despite "lifelong quest" claims; scar names lack specific causal weight for transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with storm/timer pressure culminating in Charged Poise closure; bus timetable backstory arrival strains causality slightly at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory actively pressures choices (lightning timing, cloud secrecy), with timer as micro-setting constraining the vigil; final image charged by storm reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Stakes viscerally felt in scar mapping, but "vigil in pause" concept tightens options too late; timer's final click provides decisive cost but lacks earlier tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through scar cartography, with final writing scene offering non-literal resolution; "censored poet" risk edges toward thematic echo without sufficient prior friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice modulates exquisitely under pressure ("furiously tranquil" to "storm-kissed wonder"); rhythmic control in storm/timer cadences avoids lyric self-indulgence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loop in "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving" slightly dilutes climax; otherwise exceptional density with zero scaffold in closure beat where it matters most.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/trauma avoids trauma-trope pitfalls; observatory setting elevates beyond cliché but "scars as map" premise lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
