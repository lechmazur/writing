<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "snowmelt ardor" is abstract label not embodied cost. Final smile shows success without earned trade-off or visible character shift beyond epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost proof fails—"knowing she had done what she set out to do" tells rather than shows irreversible consequence. Auroral flare lacks felt stakes reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid aurora/glacier imagery but sanctum remains decorative postcard; no constraint on choices (e.g., cold/thaw mechanics irrelevant to rope work). Micro-setting (punched card) charges closure weakly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes declared but untested; pressure grows via time dilation ("hours into days") not protagonist agency. No tightening choice—reconfiguring braids is procedural, not tactical trade-off with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through card/rope motif, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("found her own name among the forgotten") resonates non-literally though "bridges to the future" edges toward assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice over-relies on lyrical cadence ("precise and tender," "whispered secrets") diluting specificity. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy; "snowmelt ardor" violates embodied emotion rule.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("faint at first, but growing clearer") and paraphrase loops ("reverence that bordered on prayer") clutter climax. Final paragraph’s telling ("she understood that her task was not just...") undermines closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Punched card as transcribed memory offers fresh angle, but "ceremonial rope with essence" feels derivative. Strong emotional specificity in "forgotten names" motif; lacks bold risk-taking to elevate beyond competent.</comment>
