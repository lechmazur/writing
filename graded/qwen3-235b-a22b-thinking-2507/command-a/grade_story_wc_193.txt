<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("virtuously mischievous") drives bolt experimentation, but pyramid scheme trauma remains abstract backstory without embodied cost during diamond translation; micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs beyond initial portal step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: returning with diamonds forecloses escapism through "rebuild what was lost" cost, though the conceptual price ("pressures of her past") feels slightly undersold in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting—constraining choice by intensifying around the bolt and charging the final image with "gleaming new purpose," avoiding static description through causal integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) tightens through Elara's agency activating the machine, but the cost—"rebuild what was lost"—remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through diamond metaphor, but final paragraph’s "quantum promise was no longer a concept—it was a reality" triggers thematic echo penalty; wisdom feels asserted rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shimmered with soft glow," "shadowseam wonder") persists under pressure; glitchy texts maintain voice consistency without head-hopping despite multi-dimensional shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in machine activation sequence ("Elara activated it, and the pressure began to condense...") slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise high density with vivid, purpose-driven imagery like "towers of time stood beside rivers of memory."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid scheme trauma with quantum concepts feels inevitable, but "submarine porthole bolt" risks quirky ornament without deeper integration into emotional logic beyond plot device.</comment>
