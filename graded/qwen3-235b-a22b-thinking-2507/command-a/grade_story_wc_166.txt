<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—fear of erasure versus irrepressible urge to "fledge"—drive her final stance crystallization. Micro-choice of holding out her arm (not pleading) reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost: unfinished verse as both promise and threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: sentinel's departure crystallizes reconfigured stakes (verse as beacon), while garden's brighter blooms and whispering "fledge" make the felt cost legible through environmental reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting: dew enables ink mixture, obsidian flowers' midnight/silver hues constrain choices (writing medium), and their brighter bloom post-sentinel directly charges the final image with consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through sensory narrowing (wind's song to heavy air) and Lira's escalating physical risk (quill hovering mid-verse), culminating in stance crystallization. Cost is visible: the garden's exhale and blooming flowers reweight the cosmic verse's survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gaps" motif reweighted at closure: "fledge" whisper transforms cosmic verse from personal testament to collective beacon, avoiding moralizing while offering non-literal answer to nostalgia ban's cost through environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in noticing voids (leaf gaps, wind pauses) as cosmic rhythm. Rhythmic control under pressure—long lyrical sentences fracturing into "She knew she could not flee"—avoids head-hopping while modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; high density where "quill hovering over skin" crystallizes tension. Minor register drift ("spontaneously anchored" feels clinical) slightly dulls immediacy but avoids closure impact per Text-Artifact guard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through cosmic verse inscribed on skin—a synthesis of "fledge" as flight and inscription. Emotional specificity ("dust speck glowing faintly, a miniature galaxy") avoids abstraction while redefining nostalgia resistance through bodily stakes.</comment>
