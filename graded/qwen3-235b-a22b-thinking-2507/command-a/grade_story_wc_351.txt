<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure lacks visible struggle; "risky process" claim remains abstract without on-page micro-choice showing hesitation during mirror modification. Final vow feels earned but cost isn't embodied in the act itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "vowed to carry dreams forward, no matter the cost," but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—mirror modification proceeds without setbacks despite stated risks, flattening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon creates vivid atmosphere ("shadows danced like ancient spirits"), but setting doesn't constrain choices; micro-setting (mirror) charges the final image yet fails to alter mid-scene tactics during modification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("resurrect abandoned dreams") is clear early, but no deepening under Accumulative lens—pressure remains static reflection without narrowing options or testing the "risky process" claim through concrete failure points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through mirror symbolism, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing; slight overstatement in "keeper of memories" paragraph edges toward abstraction but final image ("stars seemed closer") offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "surgical accuracy") shines, but elevated diction ("profound transformation") clashes with POV during high-pressure mirror work without degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity marred by adjacent figurative loops ("memories entangled like vines," "shadows danced like ancient spirits") and near-duplicate phrasing ("fractured relic" / "scattered remnants"), slightly dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Archeologist of abandoned dreams" synthesizes tropes freshly, but moonlit canyon epiphany risks familiarity; emotional specificity elevates premise yet avoids radical transformation of standard visionary-in-desert archetype.</comment>
