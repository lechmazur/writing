<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("hands trembling, heart full") and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; final renunciation feels earned though internal conflict remains monolithic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with visible cost (exhaustion, hedgehog's retreat), but lens ambiguity past midpoint risks coherence; "no longer silent" payoff just avoids thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove constrains choice via sensory specificity ("sunlight filtered like whispered secrets"), with porcelain insulator charging final image; micro-setting elevates to 9-band through active pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving voice to silence) tightens through density increase in chisel strikes, but escalation lacks visible price scaling; hedgehog's presence complicates without altering tactics under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from stress-crack symphony, avoiding moralizing, but "empathy in motion" label risks abstraction; final melody image reweights silence without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listened to world with hands") and rhythmic control shine, though "symphonically minded" label momentarily disrupts voice consistency during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("not about creating noise but about uncovering") and mixed metaphor ("sunlight like whispered secrets") in early beats; density remains high but artifacts prevent 8.5+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "tree sculptor" trope through tactile music theory; porcelain insulator's integration feels inevitable, though alder grove setting leans slightly generic without deeper constraint.</comment>
