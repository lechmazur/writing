<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("surge of clarity," "latent power") without embodied contradiction; transformation lacks visible cost or micro-choices under pressure. No contradictory impulses shown during pivotal microdot moment—shift to "conductor of fate" feels unearned and therapy-speak smooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost implied in "stillness after last orders," but no legible cost proof at closure beat. Escalation fails under Accumulative lens: microdot discovery triggers instant clarity without deepening pressure or narrowing options—stakes remain abstract despite explicit signaling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (microdot specs) constrains choice when accidentally brushed, charging the final image as "guiding light." Kitchen sounds evolving into "background music" shows tactile integration, but lighthouse remains postcard description without spatial constraints on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("unravel mysteries") signaled early but never tested concretely—pressure doesn’t cohere as Li Wei’s journey faces zero opposition. Tightening (microdot touch) is coincidental, not driven by agency; cost ("stillness") is felt but not legible on the page per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through microdots as "metaphor for open secrets," avoiding moralizing. Final image (fortunes "whispering secrets") offers non-literal answer to "claiming destiny," but lacks complexity—no counter-readings or friction in Li Wei’s unchallenged transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory selectivity (kitchen sounds as "orchestration"), but stress response violates "prose as character": crisis thoughts retain poetic abstraction ("transpose life into a new key") without diction degradation. No head-hopping; rhythmic control strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but "symphony of self-discovery" muddles climax with forced metaphor. Information density high, yet "surge of clarity" label dilutes immediacy in peak beat—figurative language overloads high-pressure moment without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies/spycraft elevates mundane setting, but lighthouse trope and "journey to self" arc feel conventional. Emotional truth in kitchen details anchors universals, yet transformation lacks non-obvious risk—Li Wei’s choice avoids genuine struggle.</comment>
