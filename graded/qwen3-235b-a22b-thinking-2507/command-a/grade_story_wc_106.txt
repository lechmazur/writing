<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("press ear against destiny’s door") without contradictory impulses; diagnostic label-speak in Elara’s "piece of someone’s soul" line triggers -0.5 penalty. Micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Lira’s transformation from "thief" to "seeker" crystallizes with the jar’s light mingling with moonlight, reconfiguring her purpose with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds flawlessly through flower-code trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald station’s moonlight and clock tower’s frozen gears constrain action (climbing, light patterns), but micro-setting (jar’s glow) charges the final image. Misses 9+ gate by narrow margin—environment subtly guides choices yet lacks persistent constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: flower reinterpretation directly triggers Elara’s appearance, narrowing options from theft to stewardship. Cost (shedding identity) is felt in "thief no longer," though "soul" abstraction slightly dilutes visceral weight of the jar’s meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through jar’s evolution from object to responsibility, with final image ("seeker of illuminated moments") offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but "illuminated moments" stays conceptually abstract, limiting earned wisdom’s concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices coded flowers while ignoring tower’s height, reflecting her thief’s focus. Rhythmic control peaks during flower rearrangement—"weaving her own message"—with no head-hopping. Minor register drift in "luminous disbelief" repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("fingers brushed," "steps steady"), but "luminous disbelief" appears verbatim twice, triggering paraphrase loop (-0.3). Final line’s "thief no longer" avoids sentimentality with precise image charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floral cryptography with moonbeam mysticism transforms thief trope. Emotional specificity in Lira’s quiet yearning avoids generic templates, though "destiny’s door" phrasing edges toward familiar abstraction without full transformation.</comment>
