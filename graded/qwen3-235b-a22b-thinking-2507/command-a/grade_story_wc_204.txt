<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("believed patterns held the key") without embodied contradiction; motivation intensifies credibly but lacks flawed struggle. Final choice feels earned yet smooth—no visible cost from her competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "work far from over... she was ready" crystallizes eternal labor with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; frost patterns taught early pay off in final reconfiguration of purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard functions as active constraint—platform descent and cloud navigation directly alter tactics. Final image of pulsing spires charges closure, though cloud-sea borders generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering reality's patterns) tightens through descent and library revelation. Cost is legible ("work far from over") but lacks visceral punch; conceptual weight sufficient for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through frost/whisper mechanics, not moralizing. Final image reweights "compressing eternity" as purposeful labor, avoiding tidy resolution. Slight thematic echo in "reality negotiable" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost patterns a message," "whisper carried centuries' weight") modulates with tension. Minor register drift in "negotiable and malleable" disrupts peak-pressure compression during descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density overall, but final line ("story was just beginning") is cliché, dulling closure. One paraphrase loop ("rustling awakenings" repetition) and "cradling like a cradle" redundancy penalize momentum near end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scholarly obsession with cosmic stakes; letterpress mechanics transform library tropes. Emotional specificity in her craft elevates, but cloud descent risks familiar fantasy cadence without sufficient novelty.</comment>
