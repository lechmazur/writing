<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (professional complicity vs moral reckoning) drive micro-choices like clutching the watch hand; embodied guilt avoids therapy-speak but "relentless tide" metaphor slightly abstracts emotion at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: watch sinking into sand crystallizes irreversible cost of withheld truth; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as driftwood carvings reconfigure stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles and driftwood function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("fractured pieces of his own soul"), but environmental details rarely constrain active choices beyond symbolic mirroring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single deepening—memory surfacing via clock carving—narrows options to renunciation; "sieved hush" reweights guilt as felt cost, though time pressure remains underutilized as a live constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (driftwood, watch) without moralizing; final image reweights "fractured" identity with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo despite slight sentimentality in "tempered regret".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured mirror" tiles, sea-carved wood) modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, but "relentless tide" simile disrupts character-particular voice during high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sieved hush" repetition deepens atmosphere), though "relentless tide" creates minor figurative muddle in one high-pressure beat without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist-as-forger trope through tactile details (driftwood carvings, watch mechanics); risk-taking in textural escalation heightens stakes but avoids gimmickry with coherent emotional truth.</comment>
