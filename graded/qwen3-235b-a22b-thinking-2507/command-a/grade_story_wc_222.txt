<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation (sky restoration) and earned closure in rediscovering wonder, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; "cautious abandon" remains abstract label without visceral physicality during peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with chess game escalation, but cost legibility falters; the sky's restoration lacks tangible consequence beyond Kael's internal shift, weakening the Decisive Change's felt impact at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Icy setting vividly rendered yet functions as backdrop rather than constraint; shifting walls test resolve but never alter tactics or force meaningful trade-offs with the environment itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amending sky) clear and pressured through chess game, but escalation feels procedural; the cost of personal transformation isn't viscerally woven into the physical climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Kael's journey without moralizing; final image ("warmth in coldest places") resonantly reweights the premise through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in crystalline imagery, but rhythmic control frays under pressure; "sacredly playful nature" phrasing drifts into thematic echo during chess climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in abstract emotional labels ("cautious abandon"); strong propulsion otherwise, but "surge of energy" metaphor lacks textural specificity in the critical closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief archetype with poetic stakes; chess-swap method transforms heist tropes, though "apprentice of wonder" backstory risks generic sentiment without deeper integration.</comment>
