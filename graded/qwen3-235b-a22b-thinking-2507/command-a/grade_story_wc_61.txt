<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (light vs. consumption) but micro-choices under pressure lack specificity; "heart quickened" is label-only feeling without embodied cost during the pivotal gear connection moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (generational weight), but abrupt shift from "troubling serenity" to "harmonious resonance" lacks causal escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legibility dented by convenient gear transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains choice through bioluminescent blooms spilling light as liquid silver during climax, charging the final image; "petals slowing" integrates environmental detail with emotional state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) tightens via gear's conduit realization, but escalation lacks visible cost during light intensification; "weight of purpose" stated but not dramatized when stakes peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("power of transit... to shape a world") states thesis explicitly, violating organic emergence; "enduring beauty" reweights prior material but moralizing undermines resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors swirled like whispers of forgotten dreams") modulates under pressure, but "troubling serenity" repetition creates uniform rhythm in high-stakes beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in early beats, but "troubling serenity" paraphrase loop (lines 14, 18, 22) appears in final third, dulling closure image; density high except during gear transformation where "symphony" metaphor drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "calculating machine gear" as generational conduit feels inevitable, but "nebula garden" setting leans on familiar cosmic tropes without sufficient transformation; risk-taking heightens stakes but safety middle in conflict resolution caps score.</comment>
