<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in reflection scene; moves linearly from pain to acceptance without visible ambivalence during pivotal moments. Interiority is concrete but the epiphany feels slightly tidy despite strong embodied emotion ("scars glowing faintly").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: box's weight shift ("heavier with purpose") crystallizes cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently—feather visions deepen stake reweighting. No orientation debt; celestial dance motif taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cracked porcelain box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (glowing cracks mirroring heart). Moonlight actively constrains perception ("color indeterminate") and enables the feather's visions, directly shaping Elias's choice to leave it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt vs. purpose) tightens through feather visions that reconfigure pain as connection. Agency is clear—Elias's reflection drives the shift—but escalation lacks one visible tactical cost (e.g., physical tremor during decision) to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through porcelain box's evolving meaning; "bargained innocence" integrates with action (sealing feather) not meta-commentary. Final image ("bridge for all who carried cracked boxes") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused yet precise hands," "indeterminate feather color") reflects firefighter's tactile awareness. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short sentences during visions ("fragments of lives")—but "hard softness" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "fractures within him, the parts of his soul he had bargained away" dilutes momentum. Otherwise clean propulsion; final line ("no longer walking it alone") achieves high density without scaffold. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope through porcelain box vessel conceit—pain as connective tissue feels fresh. Specific details (charred oak roots, indeterminate feather) avoid generic trauma. Lacks one bold risk (e.g., disrupting lyrical flow during climax) for 8.8+.</comment>
