<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("bittersweet expression that carried both joy and sorrow"), but "whispering advisor" role lacks concrete contradiction in action; micro-choices under pressure (camera handling) slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("silence was no longer empty"), but camera's supernatural click breaks Accumulative lens rules—unestablished magic undermines causality despite poetic intent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor functions as micro-setting: moonlight-refracting camera prisms charge the final image, constraining Elara's "mapping" through tangible light/water physics that evolve with her gestures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "mapping silence" escalation, but "disrupt" goal lacks concrete opposition; cost ("she was remembered—if only by herself") feels earned yet insufficiently pressured by the harbor's stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silence as language" motif without moralizing; final image reweights silence as "alive with meaning," but "translate silence into music" premise slightly over-explained in mid-scene reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distinct via tactile sign-language focus ("fingers danced," "gestures a thread"), but minor POV leakage in "the very stones were listening"—exceeds Elara's plausible perceptual scope in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose lyrical yet precise ("prisms on the water," "tapestry of emotion"), but near-purple phrasing ("shadow woven from starlight") risks overwriting; no closure-dulling loops, though "symphony" metaphor strains slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language as musical notation elevates trope, but "forgotten artist" arc lacks risky specificity; camera's filmless magic transforms premise yet feels slightly convenient for closure.</comment>
