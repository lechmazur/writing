<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Diagnostic label "vulnerability is not weakness. It was power" in peak beat triggers penalty; internal conflict lacks layered contradiction despite credible closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"mirrors shattering into light" reconfigures identity stakes under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors library/Elara by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Seashell half functions as micro-setting charging closure, but library setting remains atmospheric postcard without constraining choices (e.g., rusted beams don’t affect search).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Elara’s agency (deciphering notes), with visible cost in "mirrors began to crack"; escalation under Accumulative lens reweights identity theft as conceptual loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seashell reunion and mirror shattering without moralizing; "vulnerability is power" statement early slightly undermines subtext but final voice avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("rust and old paper" scent guiding urgency), but filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") dilute immediacy during high-pressure deciphering beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop: "fingers brushing spines" then "traced them with fingertips" in adjacent beats; otherwise clean propulsion with no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double profession with identity quest; "whispering seashell" transforms amnesia trope through tactile decryption process.</comment>
