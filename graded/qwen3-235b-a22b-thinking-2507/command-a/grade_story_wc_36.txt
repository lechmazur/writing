<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire) during flute play, but "harvest insights from failure" labels undermine embodied struggle; flaw slightly weakens final endurance's earned quality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost (trembling hands, past trauma), but the flute's ongoing danger isn't sufficiently legible in the final image to maximize conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon hush functions as micro-setting, constraining movement and charging the climax; gilded flute's physical weight directly shapes the final image's emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory pressure (canyon hush intensifying), but the flute's activation lacks tangible cost escalation—resolution feels slightly unearned despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (flute's weight, canyon silence), but "harvest insights from failure" risks thematic echo; final step forward offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("avalanchingly quiet," bone-deep hum) modulates under pressure, though "thunder-echo range" neologism slightly disrupts voice consistency in opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loop ("determination never wavered, even as fatigue crept") dulls momentum; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-keeper archetype with sensory-driven magic system; canyon hush transforms from setting to thematic constraint without gimmickry.</comment>
