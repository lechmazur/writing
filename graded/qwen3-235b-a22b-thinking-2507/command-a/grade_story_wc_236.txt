<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's loss-driven motivation ("humanize the forgotten") compels her screw investigation, with embodied contradiction in "hands trembled with calm." Mira's sudden emotional revelation lacks friction, risking sentimentality despite strong micro-choice to handle the screw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-to-light transition and screw's evolving weight build Charged Poise closure. Orientation Test fails (location unclear until para 2), costing 0.4; "bittersweet expression" makes cost legible but late anchor caps potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw constrains choices (Elara's tactile focus compensating for smell loss) and charges the final image ("see what others could not"). Water clock's drip pressures Mira's confession timing—micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake ("unveil ordinary miracles") signaled early but pressure never tightens; Mira's exposition replaces earned escalation. Cost (Elara's perspective shift) is felt but lacks tactical alteration—no narrowing of options per Accumulative lens requirements for high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through screw's warmth and "trembling calm" reweighting, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("see what others could not") offers resonant answer to central question, but "humanize the overlooked" repetition borders on Thematic Echo (-0.2).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (smell-deprived focus on texture/sound) shines in "strange warmth" moment. Register drift in "occluded views" repetition disrupts voice cohesion; natural dialogue carries subtext but converges emotionally during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until "piecing together fragments... puzzle with missing pieces" synonym loop. Filter-verb stack ("she felt... she closed... she understood") dulls the screw-revelation beat (-0.4), disallowing 9+ despite otherwise vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapist/clock-repairer roles transforms "healing object" trope. Emotional specificity with screw's tactile discovery elevates, but "trembling calm" overuse leans toward cliché, limiting risk distinction potential.</comment>
