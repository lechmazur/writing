<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (reckless idealism vs quiet reverence) drive her final choice; embodied cost in "until there’s nothing left of me" avoids epiphany clichés. Flaw: minor underdevelopment of how her recklessness compounds problems beyond the initial trammel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "I’ll stay" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (freedom sacrificed), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by 80 words; no causality breaks. Minor deduction: cost legibility slightly delayed until final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices (roots resisting planting, chamber discovery) and charges final image; "glow of half-lit corridors" creates temporal pressure. Micro-setting (burned card in pocket) shapes all key decisions. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (freedom vs purpose) tightens through protagonist agency: roots’ trammel forces confrontation, her "I’ll stay" crystallizes stance with visible conceptual cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens via pattern break (roots forming tarot pattern). Minor deduction: cost feels slightly abstract until final line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "inlaying meaning" actions, not statement; final image reweights tarot card from debt to choice without moralizing. Avoids false balance—her sacrifice has undeniable cost. "Meaning is currency" line earns weight through scene pressure, avoiding Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle precision") modulates under pressure; syntax varies (short sentences during confrontation). Dialogue carries subtext ("meaning is currency") with voice-specific lexicon. Zero register drift or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "boots crunching on fallen petals" does triple duty (sound/action/setting). Final line’s "wove meaning into the very fabric" charges closure without overwriting. Opening/final lines anchor perfectly; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tarot/catacomb tropes through specific details (roots as "ancient veins," sapling planting). Emotional truth in quiet sacrifice feels fresh; "bartered destinies" integrates organically with actions. Avoids safety-hedging—her choice has irreversible cost.</comment>
