<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("unwavering curiosity," "incidental heroism") replaces embodied contradiction; no visible flaws complicate choices as pressure rises. Final "quiet heroism" feels unearned without tactical tradeoffs, reducing stakes to abstraction. Micro-choices lack hierarchy of values with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: location/time remain unclear past 120 words ("twilight" undefined, atrium's reality ambiguous), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—photo's "warmth" is sentimental, not conceptual price. Lens ambiguity (Causal vs. Accumulative) undermines escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid mist/sepia details anchor atmosphere but fail micro-setting test: environment never constrains choices (mist parts conveniently). Sensory details lack urgency hierarchy; "reeling hush" repeats without evolving pressure. Final image lacks constraint-driven charge, capping 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("protect voices") stays abstract with no tangible cost paid—finding photo requires zero struggle. Pressure flattens; pulses merely guide without narrowing options. Under Accumulative lens, density increase lacks cadence shift to reweight stakes, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6) for final-paragraph moralizing ("even the faintest pulse..."). "Incidental heroism" is stated, not earned through particulars; closure offers literal rather than resonant answer. Theme resolves into simplistic binary (heard/unheard) without complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Register drift in peak beats: "reeling hush" and "incidental heroism" clash with tracer's pragmatic role. Filter-verb stack ("her fingers trembled as she picked up...") dulls immediacy. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias; mist descriptions feel tourist-catalog generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Text-artifact penalty (-0.7): paraphrase loops ("mist swirled... mist thickened... mist seemed to part") and template cadence ("She knew... She wondered... She studied"). Overwriting in closure ("silent companion in her ongoing quest") obscures conceptual cost. Final beat lacks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" trope feels checklist-driven without transformation through lived detail. Emotional specificity lacks risk—protagonist faces no genuine struggle, avoiding bold stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies; safe middle choices hedge moral ambiguity.</comment>
