<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's embodied resolve ("ink pellet she carried") and contradictory impulses (subtle method vs bold escalation) shine, but the pretender remains reactive rather than a fully realized antagonist with their own flaws driving choices, weakening the relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "ancient temple library" appears at 42 words but "who" (Elara) isn't anchored until paragraph 2, triggering -0.4 penalty; closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("facade cracked") under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped by Q2 orientation penalty; library atmosphere ("dust danced in beams") is vivid but static—setting never pressures choices (e.g., ink pellet mechanics ignore spatial constraints), failing the 9+ gate despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's escalating annotations (ledger → diary → speech), with cost legible in the pretender's "frantic" tone shift; agency falters as pretender's responses feel reactive rather than driven by their own flawed choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>"The throne is a shadow" evolves into "drift is not mine alone," offering conceptual repricing through concrete particulars; nearly flawless but final line ("her story was just beginning") edges toward thematic echo, muting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature ("crumbling tomes and whispering scrolls") is distinct, but psychic distance leaks at climax: "regally unpretentious cloak now a symbol of their frailty" shifts from her POV to omniscient judgment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No fatal artifacts, but "constellations shifted" repeats with minor variation (paraphrase loop), and "stones humming" borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats; propulsion remains strong despite rhythmic hiccups.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of textual deception in fantasy (ink pellet as truth-revealer) avoids tropes; "rune of drift" concept transforms political intrigue through library mechanics, though "diminutive titan" risks quirkiness without deeper integration.</comment>
