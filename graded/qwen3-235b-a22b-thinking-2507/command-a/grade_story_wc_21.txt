<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "retrocognitively trapped" stated but not dramatized in choices. Motivation clear but emotional layering superficial beyond "grief/determination" dichotomy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure: entity's acceptance crystallizes stakes with felt cost (physical exhaustion, emotional vulnerability). Accumulative lens holds, but cost legibility slightly soft—conceptual price of truth not yet tangible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains every choice (debris ritual, parley terms); diary's physicality ("weight a reminder of lives") charges final image. Floating library underutilized but micro-setting (debris) shapes tactics impeccably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("truth in tension"), escalation via ritual density. But pressure driven by waiting, not agency—entity appears coincidentally as doubt creeps in. Visible cost (hours of labor) insufficiently deepens conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through debris ritual and diary's weight, avoiding moralizing. Final line risks thematic echo ("truth... set free") but saved by framing as Elara's hope. Conceptual cost of truth remains undercharged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist's tactile focus on objects ("worn spine," "fragile edges"). Minor filter verbs ("her gaze fixed") but rhythmic control elevates tension. Tone modulates from searing to fragile hope organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with near-zero loops; "her motivation was clear: to uncover truth in tension" slips into tell-mode. Final image ("glimmer of hope") avoids sentimentality through concrete cost (sinking boots, hours waited).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-rights archivist in steampunk desert. Debris-messages ritual transforms "plea" trope through specificity. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
