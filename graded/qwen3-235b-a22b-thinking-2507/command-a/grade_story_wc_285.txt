<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation ("distill complexity") is concrete and embodied through sensory details (clutching needle, scanning horizon), but lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; figure remains symbolic rather than a pressure-testing relationship. Final insight feels earned yet flawlessly resolved without visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (gutters stopping as time's weight crystallizes understanding), but false urgency from "until gutters stop" deadline undermines Accumulative lens—coincidental resolution weakens protagonist agency. Anchors who/where/when by paragraph 1 avoid orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fog and river render atmospheric specificity ("dark mirror reflecting heaviness"), but micro-setting (yarn needle) charges final image without constraining choices; misses 9+ gate as environment doesn't alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy effectively narrows to immediacies under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering palimpsest promise) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—the ticking gutters deadline creates artificial urgency resolved coincidentally by the figure's appearance. Cost (time's passage) is felt yet not earned through meaningful choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through palimpsest metaphor: final realization ("nothing ever truly erased") reweights fog as "barrier and bridge" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—insights arise from concrete particulars (needle, river) and charge closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time seemed to percolate," "spindrift serenity") modulates with pressure, but elevated diction ("gloom-hill coachman") occasionally clashes with implied working-class POV. Rhythmic control excels in fog-lifting climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density ("rain gutters ticking" as time metronome), but minor scaffold in opening: "scanning horizon as if part fog" followed by "senses percolating like roots" creates subtle redundancy. Avoids fatal loops yet loses hairline precision in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of palimpsest concept with tangible objects (needle, gutters), avoiding cliché through "spindrift serenity" texture. Transformation test passed—emotional specificity (coachman's quiet revelation) anchors universals, though risk-taking stops short of bold structural innovation.</comment>
