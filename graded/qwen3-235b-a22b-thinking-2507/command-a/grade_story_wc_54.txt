<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation for "equations of hope" remains abstract; interior contradiction lacks embodied tension during key sextant manipulation. No visible trade-off when redirecting flows sacrifices concrete stakes for lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost but causality falters: terminal's "response" to Eli's actions feels coincidental, not earned. Sextant's role in narrowing options remains unproven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Terminal setting vividly anchors atmosphere, yet its physical constraints (cracked tiles, vents) never actively shape Eli's choices. Sextant as micro-setting charges the final image but lacks mid-scene tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("resurrect purpose") lacks tangible escalation; no visible price paid for redirected flows. "Maze of intentions" remains thematic abstraction rather than pressure forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>Thematic resonance emerges through "stoic wonder" and sextant symbolism, but "equation for hope" phrasing risks thematic echo. Final image reweights ambition without moralizing, though cost feels intellectualized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("functionally creative mind," air/light patterns) modulates beautifully under pressure. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("began to notice," "felt") slightly dulls immediacy in high-stakes manipulation sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with purposeful abstraction ("labyrinth of intentions"), but scaffold phrases ("felt its weight, and noticed") dilute momentum. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves earned stasis charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering pragmatism and poetic resurrection avoids genre clichés. Specific "redirected flows" methodology transforms familiar decay tropes, though carnival framing lacks integration with core stakes.</comment>
