<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "orbits of regret" remains abstract label without tangible tradeoffs; journalist's disappearance lacks visceral cost on Eleanor's choices despite stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works, but cost feels conceptual rather than felt; "journey of discovery" final line overstates resolution, diluting the earned stasis of redirecting the telescope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory setting charged the final image effectively, though "above clouds" remained poetic abstraction without constraining Eleanor's physical choices during her intervention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through evidence accumulation, but the journalist's fate never concretely pressures Eleanor's actions; felt cost at closure remains observational rather than experiential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through telescope realignment motif, though "journey of discovery" phrasing risks thematic echo; final image resonates without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Eleanor's observational focus; controlled rhythm shifts during telescope recalibration beat demonstrate purposeful compression without loss of clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "orbits of regret" repetition and "solemn playfulness" summary; strong propulsion otherwise, though pen nib's physicality could deepen sensory texture in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism/observatory espionage tropes through Eleanor's specific heirloom pen and methodical recalibration; avoids cliché by grounding stakes in tangible optics.</comment>
