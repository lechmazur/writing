<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction present (duty vs freedom) but "watchful calm" remains tell-not-show; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied vulnerability in journal discovery moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with felt cost ("Some debts are paid in blood" photo), but causal escalation falters as discoveries require minimal effort; tunnel junction symbols appear without earned struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel environment constrains choices (light reveals clues, cold air signals danger) and charges final image; lantern's evolving role elevates setting beyond atmospheric to tactical necessity with specific cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose corruption) tightens causally but pressure lacks meaningful opposition; protagonist's agency drives escalation yet discoveries feel unearned (compartment yields too easily).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tunnel as memory metaphor but "entangled memories" remains abstract; final image resonates yet avoids thematic echo despite near-miss with "reverberate the truth" statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows reverberate with whispers") shines, but stress-induced diction compression absent; no head-hopping though "fortified vulnerability" tells rather than embodies emotional state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("steps deliberate, mind sharp" followed by "mind raced") and template cadence in reflection beats; high density maintained except during journal analysis where momentum sags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh integration of Underground Railroad history with infrastructure corruption feels organic; emotional truth in "breaking free" elevates predictable mentor betrayal trope through specific sensory grounding.</comment>
