<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "tenuous absolution" pursuit—savoring impossible bread while battling creeping normality—but lacks genuine struggle; no tangible cost to her gardening choices undermines earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via the plaque’s wisdom ("sacred in soil of ordinary"), but cost remains abstract; "fragile" peace lacks visceral legibility despite golden-hour tea-house moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crumbling palace courtyard functions as micro-setting: wildflowers constrain choices (bread discovery), turned soil scents charge renewal, and plaque unearthed during digging directly charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding sacred in ordinary) signaled early but lacks escalation; plaque discovery resolves tension conveniently without narrowing options or paying visible price for her hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bread/gardening motifs, but "tenuous absolution" risks abstraction; final tea-sipping image reweights ordinary as sacred without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice distinct in sensory selectivity ("scent of chamomile and jasmine," "crust faintly warm"), yet "heuristically gentle" jars as clinical intrusion; perceptual signature consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose lush but "tenuous absolution" and "heuristically gentle" disrupt lexicon; minor scaffold in reflection blocks ("palace’s history" paragraph) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as ritual against "creeping normality" feels inevitable; specificity of vanished bakery bread elevates trope, though risk-taking avoids gimmickry while deepening stakes.</comment>
