<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Leeward’s resolve is unwavering with no visible internal struggle. Micro-choices absent—his actions flow without hesitation, missing the friction required for earned change. Embodied emotion ("mallet felt warm") is strong but insufficient without deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "world was perfectly in tune" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost (dissonance resolved into "restless euphony"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density escalation—cloud patterns contracting to music—but cost remains abstract, lacking a concrete image like a physical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("leaves whispering secrets," "indigo and silver" sky) anchors setting early, but the orchard/driftwood functions as backdrop, not constraint. Fails 9+ gate: environment never pressures choices (e.g., driftwood stability never tested), though the mallet’s warmth charges the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (resolving dissonance) tighten through Leeward’s agency: each note narrows options as clouds respond. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens (density increase in cloud patterns), but cost is purely felt ("restlessness gone")—no visible price like injury or loss to charge the final image per 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "sketched resonance" reweights chaos into harmony via Leeward’s actions, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("world was his instrument") offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Near-miss on 9+ for slight thematic echo in "turn obstacles into instruments" but earns points through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clouds as "script," fractal patterns as "cosmic algorithm." Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter phrases during playing), but "restless euphony" drifts into abstract jargon, slightly disrupting the lyrical flow in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("He was not merely... but...") and overwriting ("testament to nature’s resilience") clutter mid-beats. No closure-impacting artifacts, but "fractal-generating process" introduces clinical diction that clashes with poetic voice, dulling immediacy in a high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: floating orchard prophet using xylophone mallet to interpret fractal clouds avoids cliché through specific, tactile details. Emotional truth in seeking harmony elevates it, but premise lacks deeper transformation—Leeward’s flaw (no struggle) prevents risk-taking from reaching 9+ inevitability.</comment>
