<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction in Elara’s tapping rhythms versus internal urgency; micro-choices (re-examining watermark, evening analysis) reveal hierarchy of values. Slightly underdeveloped motivation for initial dismissal of atlas page weakens causal chain to her investigation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "paths vanish because we never understood where they led" reweights premise. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via rhythmic tapping and atlas examination to crystallize stakes. Minor opacity in how alarm directly pressures her pivot to evening analysis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sea level station functions as micro-setting: metal floor constrains her posture during analysis, data uploads force temporal pressure. Atlas page’s physicality (frayed edges, watermark) charges the final realization. Could deepen tactile integration of station tools during her investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (deciphering the atlas page’s truth) tightens through Elara’s agency—her assembly of fragments narrows options from curiosity to revelation. Cost is felt conceptual weight of historical ignorance. Escalation lacks visceral friction; alarm interruption feels procedural rather than raising stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: atlas page’s erased coastline reweights "paths disappearing" as human failure of foresight. Final line avoids moralizing while charging prior material with the cartographers’ ignored warning. No thematic echo or abstraction dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: marine biologist notices coastlines, rhythms, and coral death. Prose modulates from reflective to urgent during evening analysis. "Periodically eternal" disrupts lexicon with abstract label-speak in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity overall, but "periodically eternal" functions as therapy-speak in peak beat, violating POV lexicon and muddling closure. No loops or scaffold, yet this artifact in final third disallows 9+ and slightly dulls the CR’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms climate trope via atlas page as overlooked truth-preserver; specificity of cartographer’s symbol and fossil fuel extraction site grounds universality. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands through earned reconfiguration, not gimmickry. Emotional truth in "we stop walking paths" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
