<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned despite strong embodied details like tracing locket patterns. Final choice aligns with motivation but misses visible micro-choices under pressure during the mailbox climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: courtyard "sigh" and realization reweight the stake with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 1, lens unambiguous, but "sandstorm calm" metaphor slightly muddles the cost legibility at the critical beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket) constrains choice and charges closure via the hidden key, yet the vibrant courtyard remains passive backdrop—sensory details vivid but fail to pressure tactics or alter moves despite strong jasmine/cobblestone specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Clara’s agency (inserting key) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but stakes lack visceral testing; conceptual cost of "listening heals" feels earned yet misses a visible price (e.g., no risk or trade-off during the mailbox opening).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through locket→letter chain without final moralizing, but Mrs. Ellis’s "listening is the only way to heal" borders on Thematic Echo, slightly undermining the earned resonance of Clara’s purpose realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (curator’s eye for textures) and rhythmic control shine, though "heart quickened" slips into label-only feeling during high pressure; Mrs. Ellis’s dialogue carries subtext but lacks sufficient idiom differentiation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" creates a mixed metaphor in the climax beat, violating physical logic and dulling closure’s emotional charge; otherwise clean prose with strong verbs, but this artifact in the final third triggers a -0.7 deduction per Text Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "mystery object" trope via emotional conduit premise, with specificity in thrift-curator lens and jasmine-scented dawn; avoids clichés but risks insufficient boldness in the quiet ending’s execution for 9.0+.</comment>
