<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's embodied micro-choices (humming, contacting Claire) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, but "decisively kind" remains label-heavy without visible tradeoffs; Mrs. Bennett's whispered "Claire" shows authentic frailty yet Elara's motivation lacks concrete struggle against her own grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (mother-daughter reunion crystallizing reconciliation with cost of time running out), but blood work confirmation feels summarily telegraphed rather than dramatized pressure; "confirming what they all feared" softens the causal stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Scent of hope" (lavender/eucalyptus) anchors atmosphere early but never constrains choices; vinyl fragment evolves meaningfully yet the radiant haven setting remains decorative—clouds and glow don't affect action or tactics despite vivid phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending estrangement) tightens when Elara contacts Claire, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Claire's arrival ("within hours") feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara's pressure; no visible price alters tactics despite clear cost of time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of the vinyl fragment "catching the light as if whole" reweights brokenness into beauty without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by letting sensory particulars (shared laughter, quiet evenings) embody the "hymning the mundane" concept organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("air shimmered with soft eternal glow" filtered through Elara's hospice work), but "pulsing stillness" repeats mechanically as both room description and tone label, creating drumbeat rhythm under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Opening overwrites with stacked metaphors ("radiant haven... air shimmered"); filter verbs weaken immediacy ("Elara knew this was the heart"), yet final paragraph avoids loops with clean propulsion—cost proof ("sun dipped below clouds") lands without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes through broken vinyl motif, but "scent of hope" feels familiar; emotional truth in mending estrangement saves it from derivative premise guardrail, though risk-taking stays within safe lyrical bounds.</comment>
