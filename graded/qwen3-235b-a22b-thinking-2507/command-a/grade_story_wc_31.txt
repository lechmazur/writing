<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("longing he couldn’t name") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; vow feels unearned without visible struggle against prior commitments. Interiority leans poetic but lacks concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (lifelong quest), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—descent into library faces zero resistance. Cost proof fails: no on-page sacrifice beyond internal realization during the vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor setting, but the skeleton key (micro-setting) charges the final image without constraining choices—e.g., no moment where its weight or glow alters tactics in the water or library.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("color of sound") lacks visceral escalation; no on-page test of commitment beyond easy acceptance. Cost remains conceptual without felt price (e.g., abandoning job/safety), weakening pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "luminous vows" motif reweighted in closure, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("spaces between them") resonates non-literally, though "color of sound" concept stays underexplored as thematic engine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (lamplighter noticing light textures), but stress-response flattens—diction stays lyrical during descent instead of compressing under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle in peak beats: "luminous vow" strains metaphor logic, and near-closure sentimentality ("felt like a promise") risks clarity. Otherwise strong rhythm and zero loops, but artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "color of sound" quest with maritime folklore elevates tropes, but "chosen one" arc feels familiar. Authenticity in pier-lamplighter specificity avoids Derivative Premise Guardrail.</comment>
