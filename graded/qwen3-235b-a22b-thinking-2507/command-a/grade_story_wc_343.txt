<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "sociable isolation" stated not embodied. Micro-choices lack tradeoffs: tracing symbols costs nothing tangible. Final endurance earned but cost remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: map discovery crystallizes options with felt cost (Thorne's absence transformed). Accumulative lens holds through pattern density increase. Orientation clear by line 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass hull/starling synchronicity constrains choices; hopscotch board as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory selection sharp (cawing vs. engine hum during crisis). Frayed phrasebook edges mirror emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through pattern recognition: luminance shifts from abstract goal to navigational tool. Agency drives escalation (noticing dots → following beam). Cost legible in Thorne's implied sacrifice during discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "Persevera" reweights from dog-ear to map heart. Avoids moralizing but "sociable isolation" resolution feels tidier than earned. Final compass rose image answers central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("diligently curious" lens shapes noticing spirals/crescents). Tension modulates rhythm: short sentences during beam emergence. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("frayed but potent" → "frayed but its words still potent"). Strong propulsion otherwise; "amber twilight" opening anchors voice. Final line's compass rose payoff justifies density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hopscotch board as luminance compass transforms treasure-hunt trope. Specificity anchors universals (polyglot phrasebook vs. generic journal). Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
