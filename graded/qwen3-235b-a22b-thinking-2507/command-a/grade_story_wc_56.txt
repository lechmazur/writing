<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "heart ached" is label-only feeling without specific physicality. Motivation for truth-seeking remains abstract despite journal discovery, missing micro-choices under pressure that would reveal conflicting values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (sunlight breaking as Elara stands with journal/sundial) lacks concrete cost proof; "changed everything" is vague thematic assertion rather than legible on-page consequence. Accumulative lens holds but pressure accumulation feels coincidental (chest find), not earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors early (damp earth, rotting barges) and micro-setting succeeds: sundial’s glow physically illuminates journal page, charging the final image. Misses 9+ gate as canal itself doesn’t constrain choices—discovery relies on happenstance, not environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding lies) signaled early but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation; chest discovery feels unearned coincidence rather than tactical choice. Cost remains abstract ("changed everything") without visible price paid, failing band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Final line "salvaged a truth that would change everything" is thematic echo in prompt-like language, replacing earned resonance with abstract moralizing. Theme of truth-seeking emerges but lacks non-literal answer; journal confession offers no complex counter-reading to deepen ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric texture but POV leaks in clinical observations ("a reminder that even in stillness, life persisted") inconsistent with Elara’s poetic focus. Perceptual signature weakens under pressure—generic "heart ached" replaces character-particular sensory degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("clutched... relic; key, a promise") and synonym churn ("salvage what was lost... salvage what she could") dull momentum. Figurative density acceptable in calm beats but "serene upheaval" muddles pressure; no closure-impacting artifacts but scaffold penalties apply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Derivative seeker/relit tropes lack fresh synthesis; "architecture of lies" is abstract template without specific emotional calculus. Transformation test fails—replace "sundial" with any truth-revealing object and story functions identically, indicating insufficient originality.</comment>
