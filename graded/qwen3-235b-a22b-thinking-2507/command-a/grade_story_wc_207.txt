<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (seeking answers yet embracing mystery), but flaws lack tangible struggle; the compass loss feels inevitable rather than earned through active choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "some things meant to be lost" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (compass sinking), though causal agency is passive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory specificity vividly anchors the lagoon ("eerie blue light," "jagged limestone"), but the compass lacks functional constraint—its sinking serves theme without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("waters shimmered," "resonant hush"), yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; the compass loss resolves the quest coincidentally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final rain scent reweights "petrichor" from bottled artifact to symbol of renewal, avoiding moralizing while charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent she bottled," "psychometry tingling") modulates with tension; rhythmic control peaks in the lagoon's "hinge" revelation without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("her steps were deliberate, her satchel bumping") slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, clean propulsion with zero loops—final line’s scent motif recharges prior texture flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "petrichor collector" trope with psychometry avoids cliché; emotional specificity ("spirit fuller") transforms generic mystery into earned resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
