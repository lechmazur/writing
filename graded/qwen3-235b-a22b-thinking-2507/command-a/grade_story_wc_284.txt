<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("scars etched into skin," "breath visible in cold air") but final choice lacks visible cost; the letter's arrival resolves motivation without prior contradictory impulses or earned struggle against cynicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; no on-page sacrifice for the "awakening." Snow codes introduce pressure but resolve coincidentally via the letter, violating accumulative/textural lens requirement for pattern-driven reweighting with felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff's mist and snow function as vivid atmosphere but fail to constrain choices or charge closure; the pillbox (micro-setting) anchors emotion yet doesn't alter tactics. Misses 9+ gate requiring environment to shape final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("finding unused courage") remain abstract without tangible escalation; snow codes present no meaningful risk (no failed deciphering, time pressure). Resolution via letter introduces convenient external solution, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through pillbox and mist, but final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("courage not as something to be found...") triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo, undermining the required non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist clung like a forgotten veil") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor cadence loops in metaphor repetition ("tilt of the earth") slightly dilute momentum during reflective beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong specificity but "therapy-speak" in climax ("realized fixing what's broken was not about erasing the past") triggers -0.6 penalty for diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, dulling closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transcends spy tropes via poetic accumulative structure and pillbox symbolism, but "letter from the lost" resolution relies on familiar redemption mechanics without sufficient transformation of the core premise.</comment>
