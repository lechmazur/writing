<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "shielded openness" never tested under pressure. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond reverence—no tradeoff in becoming "guardian of silence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("heart heavy with reverence"), but lens ambiguity persists: Accumulative/Textural pressure isn't taught early enough to justify the henge misalignment discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault constrains choice via excavation ("shovel struck something solid"), and frescoes charge the final image ("colors revived by light of understanding"). Sensory specificity elevates stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("whispered chapel") isn't dramatized early; pressure grows via observation but lacks visceral cost until discovery. "Map tears" timeframe remains symbolic, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silence" motif, but final paragraph moralizes ("a way to heal the divide"), undercutting earned resonance with explicit resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodically curious," "puzzle solver") holds, but "interpret silence with empathy" repetition flattens voice under pressure. No dialogue to test subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: "ancient and preserved by the very silence she sought to interpret" muddles causality. Template cadence ("Her tools were simple, but her mind was sharp") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh setting integration, but "hidden chapel" premise feels derivative. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens is coherent yet lacks transformative specificity beyond atmospheric detail.</comment>
