<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s "luminous skeptic" paradox and embodied ring sensations (metallic/sweet tastes) show concrete interiority, but her pivotal acceptance lacks visible cost manifestation; flaws don’t compound meaningfully at climax despite strong early contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) reconfigures her purpose via aurora’s "harmonious glow," but conceptual cost of surrendering skepticism remains abstract—no on-page legibility of paid price beyond stated "sense of purpose" per Cost Proof Test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lavender bluff/aurora functions as micro-setting: scent shifts guide Elara’s choices, and the converging vortex charges the climax; sensory specificity (taste-linked ring) constrains action while avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding her glow/weather) tighten via ring’s taste signals, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the ring guides her passively, diluting pressure; one meaningful deepening suffices yet feels externally imposed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ring/weather symbolism without moralizing, but "futuristic nostalgia" undercuts complexity; final image reweights luminosity as harmony yet avoids concrete cost, limiting resonance per Q5 band guardrails.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory language ("fragrance carrying whispers," taste shifts) modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, but late "futuristic nostalgia" phrase disrupts voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("ribbons of green and violet," "metallic tang... sweetness"), but "terrestrially cosmic spectacle" in para 1 triggers overwriting penalty (-0.4) via mixed metaphor violating physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via emergent compass/weather mechanics, but "futuristic nostalgia" feels derivative; specificity in ring’s taste-based sensing elevates freshness without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
