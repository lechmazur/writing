<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "transliterated emotions" reads as diagnostic label-speak (-0.5). Motivation clear but untested flaw (cool-headedness) weakens earned change. Rail spike handling reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("emotions transliterated into something greater"). Accumulative lens holds: silence density increases until symphonic eruption. Goddess appearance slightly coincidental but pays off rail spike reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rail spike (tool) constrains choice and charges final image as "tether." Sound wave garden's shifting vibrations pressure Kael's movements. Sensory hierarchy masterful—silence described through embodied absence ("whispers it carried").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("patterns breaking") deepen via constellation freeze, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—goddess appears coincidentally. Cost legible in emotional transliteration, yet pressure hinges on external intervention rather than Kael's choices tightening options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rail spike's evolution from burden to tether embodies "wild and still" duality. Final image reweights constellations as "dancing in time with the heartbeat of the world"—no stated moral, pure resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael filters sound through fisher's patience ("learned to listen to this silence"). Voice modulates from lyrical ("air hummed") to urgent ("suddenly, the air shifted"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Transliterated" repeated 3x like scaffold (-0.3). Otherwise, zero loops: "rail spike" descriptions evolve purposefully. Final line’s "zigzag across the sky" recharges motif with propulsion. No figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic chaos resolved through sound-as-silence, not spectacle. Risk-taking (goddess as echo) heightens stakes coherently. Derivative "lost goddess" trope transformed by rail spike’s tangible weight and garden’s feral lullaby specificity.</comment>
