<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (analytic drive vs. need for release), but Death as character remains thematic rather than driving choices. The sailor's letter insight feels earned through her micro-choices with the globe, yet the "first-name basis" element lacks causal pressure on pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: placing the globe down crystallizes her stance shift with visible cost ("silence felt less like a tomb"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation toward the letter's "let the snow fall" reconfiguration. Map discovery slightly convenient but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's damp wood and silt constrain choices (globe placement on floor), charging the final image. However, "sophisticated melancholy" is stated rather than embodied, weakening tactile specificity. Micro-setting (globe) successfully charges closure but occupational details remain decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: "understand the physics of letting go" versus embracing impermanence. Escalation through letter discovery deepens knowledge with cost—she releases her analytic grip. Agency is clear in the final placement, though pressure could intensify further before the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the snow globe's reweighted meaning: "let the snow fall" avoids moralizing while reconfiguring the central question. Final lullaby image resonates without abstraction, earning complexity through the sailor's unresolved loss and Elara's quiet acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle pages luminous in headlamp") reflects her archaeologist lens. Rhythmic control excels in the climax, but "sophisticated melancholy" slips into detached summary, momentarily diluting POV consistency under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "synthetic snow swirl" and "frayed ropes" demonstrate textural specificity. Propulsion accelerates seamlessly into closure ("placed it carefully on the floor"). Minor register drift in "physics of letting go" slightly jars but doesn't obscure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeology and mortality through the snow globe's impermanence metaphor. Avoids cliché by grounding insight in tactile discovery (silt, brittle paper), though the "letting go" premise risks abstraction without the sailor's concrete letter as anchor.</comment>
