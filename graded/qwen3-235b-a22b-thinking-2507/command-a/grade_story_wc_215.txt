<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; Elias' motivation to "preserve unspoken words" is told not shown through conflicting impulses. "Tranquilly perceptive" trait enables action but never creates friction (e.g., no struggle between observation and intervention during ritual).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (oasis awakening) with felt cost ("air grew heavy with emotion"), but Orientation Test fails: "scorched wasteland" lacks concrete anchors by 120 words. Lens (Causal) holds, but disorientation doesn't serve closure payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: stained glass box's shifting patterns and skeletal gardens constrain choices (ritual components) and charge final image. "Weathered stones" and "cracked cottage" reflect Elias' resilience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes lack escalation under Causal lens; covenant restoration feels inevitable. No narrowing of options during ritual (e.g., water failing/melody faltering). Cost ("weight of unspoken words") is atmospheric but not viscerally tested in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (ghosts as "flickers of light"), but final line states "preserved the weight" risking thematic echo. Avoids moralizing via "whispered gratitude in rustle of new leaves" reweighting silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light filtered through broken glass," "faint hum of bees long gone") shows character-specific noticing. Voice modulates perfectly from tranquility to urgency during ritual without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Skeletal remnants" repeated within 5 lines creates paraphrase loop. "Whispers of forgotten dreams/whispers of wind" synonym churn dulls momentum. No artifacts in closure beat, but prevents 9+ per text-artifact rule.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "beekeeping oasis" and "tangled covenant" avoids wasteland tropes. Emotional truth in Elias' quiet transformation, but "astonished recluse" feels derivative. Risk-taking (ghosts as light) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
