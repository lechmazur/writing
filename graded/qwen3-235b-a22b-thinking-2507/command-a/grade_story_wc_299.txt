<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via speaker cloth interactions, but epiphany edges toward therapeutic abstraction; contradictory impulses ("wrest meaning" vs. "insulating with facts") need sharper simultaneous tension in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "echo valley... now his to fill," but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; auction failure's stakes lack tangible on-page consequence to ground the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Speaker cloth scrap functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (pocketing = commitment) and charges the final image; quarry's "scar on earth" mirrors internal void with purposeful tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("purpose") without concrete cost manifestation; "wrest" realization deepens knowledge but lacks pressure-driven escalation—no visible trade-off like rejecting a job offer that would narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cloth's evolving meaning without moralizing; final "faint stirrings" image reweights "after the applause" with earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo despite "confidently uncertain" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frayed edges," "dust and diesel") with rhythm modulating from fragmented to flowing; slight register drift in "wrest meaning from chaos" clashes with roadie lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but "thought of the nights on stage" summarizes where scene could deepen; final line's near-sentimentality ("purpose, after the applause") is redeemed by concrete cloth motif anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms artist-crisis trope via antiques appraisal lens and quarry setting; risk-taking in quiet resolution avoids middle-ground hedging while maintaining emotional specificity through cloth scrap's evolution.</comment>
