<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs. fascination) is concrete but lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure; the pivotal amber placement feels under-earned without visible struggle against her academic nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (skepticism softened into awe), but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation; the pilgrim encounter doesn't materially tighten options or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower and fly amber constrain choices—climbing path, merging ambers—and charge the final image; sensory details (wet stone, bronze quiet) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding homecoming) is clear, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation; dusty footprints and pilgrim presence complicate without raising cost or narrowing Elara's options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through amber imagery but succumbs to abstract moralizing ("not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt"); avoids sentimentality yet lacks the non-literal resonance required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bronze quiet," academic lexicon) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shines in ascent descriptions, though pilgrim encounter flattens voice slightly with passive observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("fly amber" repetitions with minimal variation) and template cadence ("her eyes tracing... her boots sinking...") dull momentum in critical beats; strong verbs compensate but density suffers in the 700-word frame.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic awe and academic rigor avoids genre tropes; specific details (amber's "golden translucence," sculpture path) ground the premise, though the "chemistry of homecoming" concept leans slightly abstract.</comment>
