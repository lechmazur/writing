<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("deeper than nostalgia") remains vague despite consistent patience trait; no contradictory impulses shown during pivotal bell-ringing climax. Interiority lacks embodied conflict when stakes peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with visible cost (Elias's perpetual guardianship), but "wild hush" concept isn't charged in final image. Accumulative lens holds, yet cost proof lacks specificity at climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archway and cobblestones function as micro-setting that constrains choice (rhythm pacing) and charges closure image. Ebony tuning fork's physicality ("sleek surface glinting") anchors sensory hierarchy, though tool integration edges toward ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("shared balance") stays abstract without concrete test; escalation relies on atmospheric shifts rather than Elias's agency. Two distinct non-closure issues (abstract stakes + weak pressure) trigger -1.5 accumulation cap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through footsteps-as-harmony motif, but "shared balance" risks platitudinal abstraction. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing, yet lacks the resonant non-literal answer required for 8.5+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused descriptions ("whispers of the past—laughter, music"), but POV modulates inconsistently during reflection blocks. No head-hopping, yet compression in time transitions slightly frays spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid textural specificity ("vines that had choked the buildings began to retreat") with rhythmic propulsion, but paraphrase loop in "infinitely patient" repetition dulls two high-pressure beats. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-based revival trope through specific cobblestone rhythm mechanics. Emotional truth in patience-as-strength resonates, though "ghost town" setting leans slightly generic despite lyrical execution.</comment>
