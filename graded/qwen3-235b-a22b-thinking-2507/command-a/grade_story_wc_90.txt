<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in gravity shifts; "ghostly resolve" crystallizes earned endurance with cost. No therapy-speak despite spiritual theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: stitching sequence deepens pressure via sensory density. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "spirit becoming lighter" and "centuries" weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Recycled hull constrains choices (vulnerability during anomaly); soil's "aliveness" directly enables stitching action. Final image charged by "testament to resilience" micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when ruins reveal shadow work's cost, narrowing options to stitching. Visible price in Elara's gravitational shift during forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stitching mechanics, not declaration. Final image reweights "recycled" as hope without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "faint shimmer of dried tears" and rhythmic stitching cadence. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure with zero scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "harmonic resonance that began to unravel" does triple duty. Final line recharges "Eclipsed Dawn" with earned hope, zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism as dimensional repair. "Gravitationally lighter" concept transformed through specific mechanics, avoiding spiritual clichés.</comment>
