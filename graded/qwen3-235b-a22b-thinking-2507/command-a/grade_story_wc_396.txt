<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "shadow-laced" trait remains label without embodied struggle. Calm intuition guides action yet lacks visceral tension in high-pressure beats like the final reconstitution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mended fractures via light), but felt stakes remain abstract. Accumulative lens holds through mirror visions, though the "shifted options" lack concrete tactical trade-offs visible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard and crystal fragment constrain choices—ice floes mirror resolve, fragmented tool demands reassembly. Final image of radiant light charging the orchard perfectly fulfills the 9+ gate by charging closure through micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("mend deepest fractures") escalate via mirror visions but remain conceptual; no tangible cost like lost time or injury alters tactics. Agency in reconstitution is clear, yet the dominant stake lacks visceral, scene-scale consequences to justify high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through crystal reassembly as "empathy mapped onto action," avoiding moralizing. Final light spreading across fractures offers resonant CR without stated moral, though "courage as way of being" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "salt and apple blossoms" scent, but psychic distance flattens under pressure ("breath caught" lacks embodied specificity). Consistent Accumulative rhythm falters slightly when mirror visions summarize rather than deepen tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: "jagged and its surface dull" (redundant descriptors), "air hummed with energy" (generic metaphor). Strong propulsion otherwise, but figurative muddle dulls the reconstitution climax’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Lighthouse orchard above ice floes" transforms tropes through specific pressure—setting constrains action while charging closure. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "courageous anomaly" concept leans slightly familiar without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
