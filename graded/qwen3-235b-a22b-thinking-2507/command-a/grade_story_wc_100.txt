<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic but lacks embodied contradiction; "inadvertently stubborn" trait stated yet untested in action during fragment search. Emotional shift at closure ("weariness lifting") feels earned but summarized rather than layered through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds with Decisive Change closure (lens activated), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—fragment retrieval is procedural without narrowed options or felt cost. Orientation clear early, yet cost proof ("weariness lifting") remains abstract without prior sacrifice shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly rendered ("seaweed-green leather," "waterfall of algae") but functions as backdrop, not constraint. Library’s "impossible spaces" fail to pressure choices; no recurring object charges closure despite lens’s glow. Micro-setting potential ignored as environment doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find light within depths) signaled early but remains abstract—no concrete pressure like time limits or physical danger. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; fragment search feels procedural, not tightening. Cost is purely emotional without visible trade-offs during the quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action (lens as conduit for city’s soul), but final line—"sometimes, the most impossible spaces are the ones that bring us home"—explicitly states the lesson, bordering on thematic echo. Resonant image (light spreading) avoids sentimentality yet risks overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (undertaker’s focus on decay/rest) shines in phrases like "buries the unburyable," but register drifts during climax ("strange connection to the city" leans abstract). Rhythmic control falters in final paragraph with unearned cosmic imagery ("water above began to part").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lyrical density in opening ("breath fogging cracked glass") gives way to climax loops: "glowed," "pulse of light," "ethereal light" recycle imagery without escalation. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a strange connection," "realized") dilute immediacy; overwriting in closure ("water began to part") obscures causal logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker + drowned city avoids trope through "chased stillness" tone and distress-signal motif. Emotional specificity in closure elevates it, but "broken lens as mystical artifact" feels derivative. Risk-taking (lyric underwater setting) heightens stakes without gimmickry yet lacks transformative depth.</comment>
