<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (cracking voice, heaving chest) but lacks contradictory impulses; "mournfully eager" remains label rather than demonstrated conflict. Final choice earned through persistence yet misses micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with laughter's tentative return and visible cost (exhaustion), but lens ambiguity until midpoint ("hours blurred") blocks 9.0 eligibility. Orientation anchors tunnel/Eli early yet disorientation risks aren't fully leveraged for closure charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pull cord handle functions as micro-setting charging the final image (cool handle = purpose fulfilled), but tunnel descriptions stay atmospheric without constraining choices. Sensory details vivid yet over-rely on auditory cues, missing tactile depth during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring laughter) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; "hours blurred" deepens atmosphere yet fails to narrow options or raise cost. Pressure accumulates texturally but payoff feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "macerate the stillness" imagery and fragmented laughter, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "tending to the unspoken" as fragile hope, but "world itself" abstraction slightly dilutes earned resonance with household-scale intimacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("jagged, imperfect" notes, "dust motes" similes) persists under stress. Rhythmic control excels in lullaby descriptions yet "mournfully eager" repetition creates subtle voice convergence during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "off-key wind" motif drives propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction during high-pressure beat slightly dulls closure image, costing 0.1 from potential 8.7.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leaf blower as emotional conduit transforms mundane object, but "echo chamber" metaphor risks topical familiarity. Bold risk-taking in sound-as-healing feels inevitable through prior particulars yet lacks one distinctive visceral detail to push beyond 8.5.</comment>
