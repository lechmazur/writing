<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via accidental-to-deliberate whistle micro-choice, but "scintillatingly somber" label lacks embodied cost; motivation clear yet untested by friction until final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beauty and effort persist, waiting to be seen"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation before the crystallization beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Parapet functions as micro-setting constraining choices (touching whisk, leaning on railing), but bamboo whisk's tactile details don't actively shape tactics despite charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding hidden patterns) deepens through perception, yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost remains conceptual without altering Elara's immediate actions or choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from net-mending metaphor and firefly imagery; final line reweights "hidden effort" without moralizing, earning resonance through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of damp stone and blooming jasmine") shines, but "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" inject jarring corporate jargon that violates voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("whispering parapet" repetitions) and therapy-speak labels ("scintillatingly somber") dull momentum; no fatal artifacts but prevent 9.0+ with subtle closure proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher transforms trope through occupational specificity, yet firefly/moon path symbolism leans clichéd; emotional truth in "hidden effort" elevates without bold structural risk.</comment>
