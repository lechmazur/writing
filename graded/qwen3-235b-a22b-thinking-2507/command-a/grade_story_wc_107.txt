<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("afraid of vulnerability" yet crafting safe zones) embodied through glassblowing process; micro-choices like placing bookmark in sphere earn closure. Slight tell in "safe zones" motivation lacks deeper friction with past silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with "thawing heart was a process, not a destination" and bookmark placement. Cost legible in "weighty lightness" and melting ice's approval. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; pressure deepens via sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Abandoned control room's cracked consoles constrain choices (bookmark placement, glass shaping); melting ice charges final image. Micro-setting (crucible, blowpipe) guides tactile action with professional plausibility. Environment-as-character flawlessly executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through glass fragility metaphor: "cracks where light enters" reweights vulnerability cost. Agency in "abandon fear of unknown" forecloses control path. Pressure tightens via ice melting but secondary stake ("safe zones") lacks concrete on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass spheres as "containers for thoughts" without moralizing. Final image ("melting ice whispering approval") reweights "thawing heart" as process, not destination. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in concrete craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glassblower's tactile focus ("molten glass into delicate spheres") modulates under stress. Dramatic narration of tasks reveals character-specific rhythm. No POV slippage; "weighty lightness" phrase slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("frayed edges, worn leather a reminder"). Minor overwriting in "thoughtfully spirited precision" but payoff in glass metaphor justifies. Final line’s cadence shift ("cold places could warm") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes glassblowing craft with emotional thawing in non-obvious way. "Safe zones" concept transformed through tangible spheres. Bold risk in making internal process the sole plot driver; specificity (cracked bookmark, control room) anchors universals.</comment>
