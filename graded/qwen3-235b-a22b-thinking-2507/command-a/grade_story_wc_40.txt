<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to decode language's "pattern of growth" is clear but "weathered innocence" remains abstract; Elias lacks contradictory impulses in key moments like the draining crystal climax where interiority defaults to singular reverence rather than conflicted urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: crystal's depletion ("energy draining into him") creates undeniable conceptual cost for language restoration, but the "faint whisper of hope" final line slightly overstates the reconfiguration under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choices (solitude for study) and charges closure; crystal's physicality drives the final image ("cradled gently in his hands") with depletion cost, satisfying 9+ gate for micro-setting object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as crystal drains during decoding, narrowing Elias's options to a single choice (accept depletion for the pattern), but the cost isn't viscerally felt until too late in the escalation arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of language's fragility emerges organically through crystal's echoes and Elias's work, with the final "whisper of hope" offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing but secondary theme of sacrifice lacks depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("fingers tracing contours," "breath shallow") with rhythmic control during pressure; no head-hopping, though minor register drift occurs in "testify to what he heard" amid high-stakes decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong line-level propulsion but "suspended hush" repetition (opening/ending) creates subtle paraphrase loop; "weathered innocence" phrasing borders on thematic echo without sufficient concrete embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms library/crystal tropes through specific linguistic decay premise; "sonically reflective" detail grounds the fantastical element, though "after last dictionary printed" concept risks over-familiarity without deeper world logic exploration.</comment>
