<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation "texture of transformation" lacks embodied conflict; epiphany feels unearned as contradictory impulses (surrender vs. preservation) aren't dramatized during the bottle release. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond symbolic action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cosmic resonance but cost legibility fails: releasing the bugs has no physical/emotional consequence shown on page ("lighter steps" contradicts sacrifice). Lens (Accumulative) holds yet cost arrives too late for full integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Black sand and bottled bugs charge the final image (merging light with stars), satisfying 9+ gate. Volcanic sulfur scent establishes atmosphere early, though beach setting itself never constrains choices or alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Detour lacks meaningful pressure—Elara "reluctantly" turns but shows no resistance. Whispering hush functions as coincidence, not escalation; stakes remain abstract despite celestial alignment. Agency evaporates during pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids direct moralizing but "texture of transformation" risks abstract prompt-language. Final image (bugs joining stars) provides resonant non-literal answer, though thematic echo "rough and alive" skirts sentimentality without concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sulfur scent," "cool grains") but register drift occurs: "texture of transformation" phrasing breaks POV plausibility for a destitute woman. Rhythmic control strong yet over-reliance on lyrical abstraction dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("toes sinking," "whispering hush"). Minor scaffold in opening ("timeless dance") but zero loops; figurative language serves pressure without muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms beach-epiphany trope via volcanic setting and bottled bugs motif. "Texture" angle feels fresh yet lacks emotional specificity—could work unchanged with different names/places, limiting originality.</comment>
