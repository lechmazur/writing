<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister’s disappearance feels personal but backstory remains told, not dramatized under pressure; micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during climax (e.g., no hesitation before bottle handoff).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—border unity with "temporary respite" cost—but drone chase resolution relies on convenient crevice escape, slightly weakening causal escalation at pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade’s frozen clock mirrors border stalemate beautifully, but setting never constrains Elias’ choices; micro-setting (bottle) charges closure yet environment fails 9+ gate by not shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending border) tightens via drone chase, but escalation leans on bottle’s magic rather than Elias’ agency; cost ("temporary respite") is legible yet lacks deeper tactical consequence for protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "broken promises heal" motif, with final image ("delivering a chance") offering resonant, non-literal answer; avoids moralizing but bottle’s magic slightly oversimplifies conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("brittle hush," "neon lights flickering") with rhythmic control; tension modulates seamlessly into lyrical closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in bottle description ("swirling like a tempest trapped in amber" → later "internal tempest"); no fatal loops, but "thunderstorm in a bottle" repetition slightly dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone smuggling and magical realism elevates trope, yet "storm in bottle" device feels derivative; specificity of cobalt arcade and Luma drone adds authenticity without gimmickry.</comment>
