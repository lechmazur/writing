<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "weightless burden" duality, but peak action lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; embodied emotion strong yet final choice lacks micro-choice escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost ("weightless burden lifted"), causal lens held rigorously from whispers to clock activation; orientation solid by line 5 with circus setting and Marcus' ghost-seeing established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mainspring barrel (tool) constrains choice at climax and charges final image; dust patterns directly alter tactics, fulfilling micro-setting requirement for 9+ band through functional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marcus' agency (dust analysis → climbing) under causal lens; cost unmistakable in "warmth spread... burden lifted" with persistent stakes in final line about recurring cracks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ending reweights theme through "cracks always reappear" without moralizing; subtext operates in ghost gestures and clock mechanics, avoiding thematic echo while embracing cyclical healing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via technician's observational bias ("dust accumulation patterns"), though calm-moment rhythm lacks variation; no head-hopping, voice modulates perfectly under ghost-reveal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; final line "cracks always reappeared" crystallizes theme with surgical precision. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("cracks... pulse with life") without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech + horologist object in circus setting avoids ghost-story clichés; "weightless burden" reframes supernatural ability with emotional specificity that wouldn't work generically.</comment>
