<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "dappled resolve" stated not embodied through micro-choices. Final discovery lacks visible cost—no struggle with truth's implications despite "doubts lingered" setup. Interiority leans abstract during pivotal map alignment ("mind racing with possibilities").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: blackout ends but Elara departs unscathed, no sacrificed option or enduring consequence. Orientation strong early, but climax’s "stillness remained" feels thematic assertion, not earned reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet stakes evaporate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and crumbling stone create vivid texture, yet setting never constrains choices—darkness guides but never hinders. Stamp’s physicality (ink viscosity, weight) underutilized despite pivotal role. Final glass dome illuminates text but fails to charge closure with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("trace honest origins") signaled early, but blackout’s "waning" urgency remains abstract—no concrete moment where time pressure alters tactics. Stamp activation resolves conflict too cleanly; no trade-off or loss (e.g., stamina, tool, or moral compromise) to narrow options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing, but "honest origins" resolution lacks complexity—truth is pure revelation, no cost or counter-reading. Final image ("journey beginning") hints at resonance but feels unearned; thematic weight diluted by Elara’s uncomplicated triumph over neglect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of the library," "reclaimed stillness") sustains Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: "dappled resolve" phrasing repeats without deepening under pressure. Tension in map alignment ("heart raced") slightly over-told, but rhythmic control elevates atmospheric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, yet "tranquilly perceptive" recurs as near-synonym ("attuned," "intuition") without added pressure. Strong verbs ("lapped," "crouched") but climax’s "soft, ethereal light" slightly generic. Final line’s "journey beginning" lacks the textural specificity of earlier prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms library trope via sunken city and ink-stamp mechanics, but "truth revealed by artifact" premise remains familiar. Emotional specificity in Elara’s quiet resolve elevates it, yet avoids bold risk—no moral ambiguity in uncovering "untainted" history, missing complexity for 9+.</comment>
