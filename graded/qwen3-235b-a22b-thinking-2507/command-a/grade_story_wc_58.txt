<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the traveler’s silent obituary-writing for the waiting self, but her backstory lacks causal weight; the carpet thread’s significance feels unearned despite vivid embodied choices like projecting presence as witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (the woman’s tears, traveler’s acceptance), but the "geography of healing" lens emerges too late (~line 150) for seamless integration, narrowly missing 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden setting charges closure: falling leaves and shadows constrain choices (the woman’s fixed gaze), while the carpet thread evolves from relic to shared talisman, making the final "tapestry" image resonate with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the woman admits waiting for a ship that won’t return, crystallizing the "explained absences" conflict; but the ship’s timing lacks causal pressure on choices, missing the visible cost escalation needed for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the obituary’s "absence a thread in the tapestry" metaphor, but the closing line ("map drawn not in miles but moments") risks thematic echo, nearly triggering Q5’s -0.5 penalty for near-moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: traveler notices "sunlight filtering through canopy" as golden patches while the woman stares beyond trees; rhythmic control under pressure ("footsteps crunched softly") avoids head-hopping despite dual perspectives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "crisp air carrying scent of fallen leaves" redundantly echoes "autumn had fully claimed the land"; otherwise, zero scaffolding and potent propulsion ("light piercing darkness like tiny obituaries").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "obituaries for the living" trope through the carpet thread’s tangible symbolism; emotional specificity in the woman’s silent tears avoids generic grief, but the ship’s departure lacks fresh inflection beyond established melancholy.</comment>
