<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("translate heartbeats into maps") without concrete stakes or internal conflict; embodied emotion limited to repetitive "patience" labels without contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—tremor and glow feel coincidental rather than earned consequence; no visible price paid despite "felt cost" requirement for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard vividly constrains action (frost-kissed ground, discarded items), with the illustration plate charging the final image as micro-setting; sensory details serve urgency without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No escalation of dominant stake—ritual proceeds unchallenged; "tremor" is coincidental complication without narrowing options or altering tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of patience/starmaps emerges through concrete actions (sealing starlight), but abstract "interconnectedness" conclusion lacks earned resonance; avoids moralizing but stakes remain vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost-kissed ground," "ghostly moon") modulates rhythm to pressure; no head-hopping, with lyric compression taught early through alchemical focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("calloused yet graceful... hands remained steady") and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; final third artifacts cap 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alchemy premise transformed through specific "discarded items" ritual, but "safekept starlight" leans derivative; emotional truth in patience motif offsets middle-ground hedging on stakes.</comment>
