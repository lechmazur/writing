<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in profession (charcoal strokes as emotional translation) but lacks contradictory impulses; "confronting the very nature of empathy" veers toward diagnostic label-speak (-0.5). Micro-choices under pressure (sketching vs. chasing) reveal values, yet emotional progression remains too linear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: quarry "listening" after portrait reconfigures empathy’s possibility. Accumulative lens holds through mist/ribbon density, but figure’s appearance lacks causal motivation—coincidence complicates but doesn’t deepen stakes. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry actively constrains choices (mist forcing texture focus) and charges final image (parted mist revealing path). Ribbon fragments function as micro-setting objects that physically merge during climax, altering tactics. Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency: gravel crunch under tension, mist’s softening in resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens when figure appears with matching ribbon, escalating to Elara’s realization that quarry = "chasm between people." Conceptual cost is unmistakable ("dormant empathy... begun to stir"), but resolution edges toward convenience—quarry’s "acknowledgment" risks sentimentality without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: portrait unifying opposites, ribbons merging "like strands of forgotten story." Final dawn path offers resonant answer to "chasm" metaphor without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by dramatizing empathy via physical acts (whispering name, sketching), though "dormant empathy" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: professional attention to texture ("charcoal stick moving swiftly"), emotional compression ("breath visible in chill air"). Register drifts slightly in "unification of opposites" exposition. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during figure encounter, but "furrowed concentration" feels generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("mist clung... ghostly shroud" compresses setting/emotion). Final line’s rhythm ("one stroke at a time") shows propulsion. Minor overwriting in "emotional landscapes" but payoff earned through portrait’s physicality. Closure image crystal clear with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms cold case trope through sensory-specific artistry (charcoal on quarry stone). Face-blind artist angle synthesizes flaw/constraint ingeniously. Risk-taking in making setting the emotional antagonist elevates stakes, but "dormant empathy" lacks fresh inflection—conceptual integrity strong yet not fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
