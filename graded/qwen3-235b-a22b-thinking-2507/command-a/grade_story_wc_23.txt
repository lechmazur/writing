<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "raw solace" embodies contradictory impulses. Final endurance as Earned Stasis forecloses isolation with visible cost ("glow dimmed as moon waned"). Flaw: Mara's sudden community leadership lacks friction—flaws don't compound sufficiently before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: beacon works but cyclical task persists, cost legible in "glow dimmed." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks with traveler arrival. Weakness: cryptic calls resolve too neatly as "instructions," reducing pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Starlit station constrains choices (scavenging ruins) and charges closure ("sanctuary and prison" → refuge). Censer foot’s moon-phase fluctuation directly alters tactics. Micro-setting mastery: tool-as-setting drives plot while avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("navigate geography of loss"), deepening when beacon calls first traveler. Agency-driven escalation via building, but cryptic calls undermine causality—they "guide" without cost or struggle. Cost legible in cyclical burden, yet resolution feels frictionless despite high-band pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "patchwork" metaphor: censer foot repairs world like Mara weaves community. Final image reweights loss as "depths of human heart" without moralizing. Near-failure: "raw solace" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "weathered walls bearing scars of storms" filters setting through Mara’s grief. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during building ("grueling, hands raw") contrast lyrical moon descriptions. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "patina bronze censer foot" earns specificity without overwriting. Final line’s cadence shift ("one step at a time") recharges "patchwork" motif with propulsion. Minor flaw: "reverse migration" feels slightly thematic rather than organic in early beats, but pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "navigator" trope through tactile grief ("raw solace," scavenging ruins). Moon-phase mechanics avoid cliché by constraining tactics. Risk-taking: Accumulative structure rejects causal beats yet closure lands. Freshness in "geography of loss" as physical/emotional terrain.</comment>
