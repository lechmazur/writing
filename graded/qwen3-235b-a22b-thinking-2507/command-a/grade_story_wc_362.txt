<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("heart aching," "weight of it") rather than embodied contradiction; the grief revelation feels passively received, not earned through active choice. Micro-choice strength lies in trembling hands turning the prism, but epiphany lacks prior causal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with "truthful lie" reweighting the premise, and cost is legible in the "heavier air." However, lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Causal) at midpoint weakens escalation clarity despite strong final charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and prism function as micro-setting, constraining choice through light-refraction mechanics that directly enable the climax. Final image ("air felt heavier") charges closure, but mist’s atmospheric role lacks causal pressure beyond mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory density (resonance → grief revelation), but escalation feels passive—Elara receives the prism’s story rather than actively pursuing it. Conceptual cost (shattered theory) is visible, yet protagonist agency in deepening pressure remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" theme emerges organically from prism’s duality, with the final image ("beauty that concealed pain") offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though "enduring imprint of humanity" flirts with thematic echo but escapes final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in light/frost imagery ("captured stars," "frost on car window"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") dull immediacy in high-stakes communion beat, slightly undermining voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but contains minor paraphrase loops ("faintly... faintly... faint resonance") and redundant telling ("not just an object... vessel, conduit"). No closure-dulling artifacts, yet slight scaffold in opening reduces propulsion under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of object permanence and emotional residue ("frost as language") elevates familiar mystic trope. Lacks bold structural risk; "truthful lie" insight feels inevitable but not sufficiently transformed beyond poignant specificity.</comment>
