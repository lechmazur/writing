<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("foxglove regret") but the inciting "pull" lacks sufficient motivation from established traits; "sacred task" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (shattered wind chime preserving voices); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts; cost proof crystallized in "fragments floating upward like shards of moonlight" amid preserved echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (museum of extinct feelings) constrains choice via thinning air and denser clouds, charging the final image; "glass orchids swaying in approval" reweights environment as active participant in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's singing agency under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in shattered wind chime and "heart heavy with foxglove regret," reweighting preservation stakes through visceral loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of glowing vessel reweights "deserted marvels" as living legacy without moralizing; theme emerges through crystallized names and broken chime's "peace," avoiding abstraction while charging emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline tears," "luminous floor") but "gently systematic grace" borders on elevated diction; rhythmic control under pressure falters slightly in climax with "flowing through her like a river" abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high propulsion; minor figurative density in "light bloomed... as if extinct feelings awakening" risks muddling but final image ("names etched deeper") maintains clarity and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library/museum concepts transforms preservation trope; "foxglove regret" specificity avoids generic melancholy, though "wind chime summoning storms" leans slightly derivative without deeper rule integration.</comment>
