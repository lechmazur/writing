<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choice to test further shows contradictory impulses (certainty vs. caution) with embodied cost, but Liora's passivity risks undermining interiority despite strong telepathic constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (shattered certainty requiring adjustments), causal lens holds through ampoule fragility escalation, but lens ambiguity at midpoint slightly weakens causality proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Garden setting constrains choice via ampoule fragility warning, but seaweed/coral details remain decorative; micro-setting (ampoule glass) charges final image yet environmental specificity lacks urgency-driven sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully around ampoule fragility with visible cost (Elara's fractured resolve), but secondary pressure from village disease feels off-page, diluting dominant stake escalation under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ampoule's dual nature, but final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("unyielding truths shaped by kindness") violates organic emergence, triggering thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Liora's telepathic voice ("tapestry of whispers"), yet marine biologist jargon ("serum derived from foxglove") slightly disrupts POV consistency during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful fragments ("thoughts were frantic, a jumble"), but "marble surface etched with the wear of ages" contains generic modifier weakening textural specificity in key image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue as nuance guardian avoids trope pitfalls, though underwater city garden setting edges toward familiar magical realism without sufficiently transformative stakes.</comment>
