<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("discover beauty in incomplete") drives action but wanderer's motivation lacks causal grounding; his "lost ability" feels stated not earned, weakening the shared closure cost despite strong embodied choices like feather transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with kite's ascent reconfiguring meaning, but the cost ("warmth spread through her") remains emotionally abstract rather than viscerally legible; Accumulative lens holds though the wanderer's backstory gap slightly undermines pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon actively constrains choices (tide line landing, reflection imagery) and charges the final image; sensory details like "scent of wet earth and salt" filter through poet's perception to mirror internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully around "beauty in incomplete," but the wanderer's sudden appearance and unexplained string-cutting rely on coincidence that complicates rather than escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost lacks visceral specificity despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the kite's repair and feather exchange, avoiding moralizing; final image ("beauty isn’t found in perfection") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, though the wanderer's epiphany edges toward thematic echo in delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("arranging thoughts like beads on string"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure; voice modulates perfectly from stillness to collaboration, though minor register drift occurs in the wanderer's "woven dawns" line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("iridescent hues a gift from a fisherman who claimed it had fallen from the sky") advances multiple elements without muddle; final image’s rhythm crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven dawns" with kite repair feels inevitable; specificity of cobalt lagoon and feather avoids tropes, though the wanderer archetype slightly limits ingenuity despite strong contextual transformation.</comment>
