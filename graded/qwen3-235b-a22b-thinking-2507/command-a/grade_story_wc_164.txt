<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in concrete action (pressing seed into glass) avoids epiphany clichés; contradictory impulses evident in shifting focus from memory to emotion. Minor deduction for slightly tidy resolution of grief without lingering friction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: memory's flickering vanishing reconfigures "missing pieces" with conceptual cost ("beauty in rediscovery"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation to crystallize stance. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crater glass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must press seeds into it) and charges closure image; crystal walls' shimmer directly mirrors the forest path memory. Cave ambiance avoids postcard syndrome by reflecting emotional state through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's escalating frustration ("sand slipping through fingers") to the emotional pivot point. Cost is legible in memory's fleeting return, but "before memory faded" remains abstract without tactical time pressure—sufficient for length but limits escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: scattered seeds reprise transforms "migratory nature of memories" into resonant closure image. Avoids moralizing while reweighting "why paths disappear" via concrete cost (flickering memory). Perfect Q5 9+ test fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crater glass patterns resembling forgotten constellations"; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("images dissolved like sand"). Minor deduction for "cheerful gloom" bordering on abstract phrasing during peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmered with hues of violet and gold" demonstrates high-density textural specificity. Near-deduction for "cheerful gloom" (slightly stock phrase) but saved by contextual integration. Closure image ("scattered seeds as reminder") avoids sentimentality through concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory trope via "sea-foam recollectionist" specificity and migratory seeds as organic metaphor. Emotional truth in "void never truly healed" avoids generic loss. Fresh inflection: paths disappear *to be rediscovered*, not lost—a synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
