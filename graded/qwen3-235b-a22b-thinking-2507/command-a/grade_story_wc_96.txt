<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but molting trait remains ornamental; no contradictory impulses or earned change with visible cost. Clara’s healing feels unearned without specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No legible cost at closure despite Charged Poise attempt; "patching is how we rebuild" handwaves stakes. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at moonlit rooftop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rusted library evokes atmosphere but never constrains choices; coffee tin’s false bottom lacks tactical impact. "Map of scars" image charges finale weakly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens—rebuilding happens off-page. Clara’s doubt ("just patching things up?") introduces tension but Elias’ reply forecloses no path with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty: final paragraph moralizes ("testament to power of rebuilding") replacing earned resonance. "Blooming resistance" stated but never tested through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (patched coat, scribbled verses) but Elias/Clara dialogue lacks voice differentiation. "Luminous fracture" recurs without pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "crumbling spines"/"fractured darkness" near opening; no closure-dulling artifacts. Strong verbs ("molts," "forged") offset slight lyricism in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in molting concept but underutilized; prison library setting avoids generic decay tropes. Derivative premise guardrail applies yet specific coffee tin details elevate.</comment>
