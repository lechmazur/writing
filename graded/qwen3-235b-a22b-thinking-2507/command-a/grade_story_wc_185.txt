<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; "restore balance" phrasing triggers diagnostic label penalty. No visible flaws complicate choices—Lira succeeds perfectly without internal struggle or embodied emotion beyond generic "weary but spirit light." Cost feels unearned for closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost ("body weary") but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. Causal chain holds (cracks → path → bloom), yet the cost remains superficial—no deepening of sacrifice beyond physical fatigue. Orientation anchors firmly by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (echo chamber stone) charges the final image ("lay silent") but environmental details don't constrain choices. Harmonic caves described vividly yet functionally inert—no spatial obstacles or resource limitations pressure Lira's actions. Misses 9+ gate as setting doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when storm "strongest here," but escalation relies on convenient magic (stone hums, cracks glow) rather than Lira's agency. Cost ("body weary") is present but disconnected from tactical shifts—no trade-offs or irreversible losses narrow her options meaningfully before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (bloom's glow vs. beings' cacophony), but final line—"beacon of silence in a world of noise"—edges toward thematic echo. Avoids moralizing yet the lullaby resolution feels pat, lacking the ambiguity or conceptual cost required for 9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "crack patterns" and cave hums, with rhythmic control modulating from tense ("air growing heavier") to calm. Under peak stress, diction stays precise but lacks compression—e.g., "conjure" remains clinical when physical urgency should alter syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor loops: "gently luminous glow" repeats 3x with near-identical phrasing, and "humming" recurs 4x without pattern-teaching. Final third contains paraphrase artifacts ("light spreading like a wave... silence enveloped the world"), disallowing 9+ per Q7 rules despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Specific details (ripple-mark mapkeeper, ice-crack method) transform a standard "restore balance" premise, but no bold risk-taking elevates structure. Emotional truth in "weary but spirit light" avoids genericity, yet the causal resolution lacks the non-obvious synthesis required for 8.5+.</comment>
