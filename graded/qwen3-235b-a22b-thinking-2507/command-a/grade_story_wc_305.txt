<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("kindly decisive" yet unrestful) drives choices, but emotional calibration edges toward tidiness in the lake vision. The betrayal's "unforgivable" weight lacks embodied cost in the present frame, slightly undercutting motivation depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara's emergence crystallizes stance with felt cost (transformed unrest). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation toward the lake's vision without causal breaks. The "cycle" realization reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the hairpin and scallop shell constrain choices (map discovery, lake entry), charging the final image. "Vineyard hush" subtly mirrors internal calm, though cloud-level grotto lacks tangible pressure on tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) tightens meaningfully when the hairpin reveals the map, narrowing options to pursuit. Cost—relinquishing unrest for cyclical peace—is legible in the final image, though the betrayal's impact on present stakes could deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rebirth as "practice, not destination" resonates through the hairpin's glow and lake vision. Final image ("garden more vivid than ever") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "moss-covered stone") filters all description. Rhythmic control intensifies in the lake vision ("lives she had lived... mistakes she had made"). One filter verb ("she felt a strange warmth") slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("quiet unrest lingered... yearning she couldn’t name") and a near-duplicate phrase ("world felt smaller, the noise of her thoughts quieter") dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("beauty more vivid... felt whole") showcases masterful propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "scallop shell as portal" and hairpin-as-map transform rebirth tropes through tactile specificity. Emotional truth elevates it, though the moon-eyed woman verges on archetype. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies narrowly (-0.2) for mystical guide familiarity.</comment>
