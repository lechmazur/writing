<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (trembling yet resolute voice) but "photosynthesize pain" borders on abstract metaphor; micro-choices like clutching the postcard reveal values, yet flaw-driven stakes lack concrete cost escalation beyond wear on the postcard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the shell's "exhale" and "reef-shadow joy" crystallizing harmony within pain, but the conceptual cost remains oblique; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, though no tangible forfeiture (beyond postcard disintegration) legibly narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell setting charges closure via spirals "etched into her soul" and wind as active collaborator, while the galaxy postcard's physical degradation (translucent edges) constrains her process; micro-setting specificity elevates beyond generic atmosphere but risks overwriting in "reef-shadow joy" description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("centuries of longing") deepen through sensory accumulation, yet pressure lacks tangible escalation—doubt threatens but never concretely impedes her lullabies; the cost remains conceptual (weight of longing) without measurable tactical alteration, weakening the Accumulative lens's payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "blossom armistice" as earned non-literal resolution (pain/beauty harmony), avoiding moralizing; final stars "winking" reweights the galaxy postcard’s meaning, though "photosynthesize pain" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient prior struggle to ground it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details (cool shell surface, wind-carrying melodies), with rhythmic control in lullaby descriptions; minor register drift occurs in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but compression (e.g., "hours into days") teaches the Accumulative pattern early and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "off-key wind" and "spirals etched into her soul," yet overwriting risks appear in stacked metaphors ("tapestry of sound, each thread of sorrow"); paraphrase loops in "muted tones"/"reef-shadow joy" descriptions dull momentum slightly but avoid closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of biological ("photosynthesize") and cosmic imagery transforms insomnia tropes; the shell’s sentience feels fresh, though "blossom armistice" leans abstract. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, but emotional specificity slightly falters in universalized longing.</comment>
