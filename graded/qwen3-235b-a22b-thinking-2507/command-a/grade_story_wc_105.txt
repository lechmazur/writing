<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (collecting absence "as fragile glass") but "battered marvel" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, triggering penalty. Contradictory impulses under pressure are underdeveloped despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) closure. Orientation debt past 120 words (unclear era/timeline) applies -0.4 penalty despite functional closure with visceral cost ("resonant ache in chest").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ashen forge) constrains choice and charges final image ("hearing aid attuned to quiet strength"). Shipwrecks actively pressure collection method, meeting 9+ gate through tactical integration rather than decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single meaningful deepening when forge activates, reweighting trust-breaking sound with felt cost. "Cells divide" timeframe is ornamental without altering tactics, limiting escalation beyond one valid intensification under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars ("hollow echo shaped like a scream") avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "trust breaking" as beauty through concrete action, though "battered marvel" edges toward thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lavender hum," "indigo rumble") shows synesthesia as lived experience. Minor register drift in "battered marvel" disrupts voice during peak pressure but rhythmic control during forge activation elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "resonant ache that echoed" has slight synonym churn. Zero closure-touched artifacts; paragraph cuts vary purposefully to mirror emotional cadence during absence collection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia and memory physics feels inevitable. "Collecting absences" method transforms trope through specific, tactile execution (palming shipwreck hull) without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
