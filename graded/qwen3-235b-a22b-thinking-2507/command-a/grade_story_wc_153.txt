<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak (unspoken regret vs. current mission lacks friction); "fierce tenderness" stated not embodied; closure choice earned but emotional progression over-tidy without irrational layers at peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density escalation; condensation messages tighten stakes; closure (Charged Poise) reweights regret as bridge but cost legibility falters—feeling "whole" lacks visceral tradeoff for healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots actively guide path; condensation-as-setting constrains discovery (shard must press glass); final shard warmth charges closure image; micro-setting perfectly fulfills 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via message density ("You were never too late" to personal letter); agency drives path but cost remains abstract—regret transformed to "bridge" without felt sacrifice, weakening Accumulative pressure's conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through condensation messages and shard's evolution; final image (letter as bridge) offers resonant answer but "apology becomes harmony" moralizing in last paragraph risks thematic echo, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots twisted like ancient fingers," moonlight as "liquid silver"); rhythmic control deepens in grove scene; minor overwriting ("air hummed with songs of unseen spirits") slightly disrupts pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with strategic telling; "fierce tenderness" abstract label in climax triggers -0.4; no closure artifacts but "dappled moonlight"/"liquid silver" proximity risks synonym churn, dulling peak-beat immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove spirits + unsent letters as physical regret; shard's moonlight-healing misdirection avoids trope; risk-taking heightens stakes but predictable "healing" resolution lacks bold emotional complexity for 9+.</comment>
