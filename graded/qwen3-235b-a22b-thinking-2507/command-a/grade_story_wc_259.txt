<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "anguished joy" grounds motivation, but verbatim repetition of the phrase risks label-speak; micro-choice kneeling on worn tiles reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "end of innocence was not an ending" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost; Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) holds through pagoda's activation and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("at her back"); saffron veil's tactile flutter and light-refraction details constrain choices during the kneeling beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when she recognizes "pattern of absence"; cost legible in "erosion of innocence" realization during pagoda activation, though secondary conflict lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("not a burden but a gift"), avoiding moralizing; "atoms of nostalgia" reweights meaning in final image without abstract statements, though "cherish" borders on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadows danced across crumbling stone tablets" and bronze's "amber and indigo" hues; psychic distance shifts intentionally during epiphany but tense wobbles in "she had sworn" reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Density overload with "atoms of nostalgia" (4 repetitions in 200 words) and "steadily unpredictable" as label-only trait; "liquid gold" metaphor slightly muddles the climactic beat despite rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological quest as internal mirror; "pattern of absence" transforms trope through specific tactile discovery, though saffron-veil historian archetype lacks full novelty.</comment>
