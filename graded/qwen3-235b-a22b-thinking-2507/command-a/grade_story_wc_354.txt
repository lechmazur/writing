<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through worry stone’s duality (flaw/resilience), but "silence is not strength" risks therapy-speak; exile motivation remains embodied via chess micro-choices under magnetic pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: king-toppling crystallizes stance with cost (worry stone’s weight), but twilight anchoring slips past 120 words; accumulative lens holds through nexus pulse escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Worry stone constrains choice (pocket weight → resilience symbol), yet magnetic nexus remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics; micro-setting elevates closure but environment lacks causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant as barrier/bridge) tightens via chess sacrifice, but cost remains conceptual; escalation driven by protagonist’s translation method lacks visceral price beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through knight’s sacrifice reweighting "eclipsed covenant," avoiding moralizing; final image ("translate silence into new beginning") resonates non-literally though "beauty in difficult" risks prompt-echo proximity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chess-driven syntax ("thoughtfully precise movements"), but "twilight draped the sky" slips into ornamental lyricism; tension modulates voice without POV drift under nexus pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "recall the day she was exiled" summary loop; high density otherwise, though "hues of indigo and amber" borders purple prose—no closure artifacts but cadence stutters at reflection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess logic with exile narrative, but "magnetic nexus" verges on familiar mystical trope; emotional specificity in worry stone dent elevates beyond template, though covenant concept lacks transformative depth.</comment>
