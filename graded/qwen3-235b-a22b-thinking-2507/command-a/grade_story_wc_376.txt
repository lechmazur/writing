<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. fear of painful truths) act simultaneously when betrayal whispers wilt her leaves; her final inscribing choice is earned by the chamber’s visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: the new plate’s creation triggers water’s return with visible cost (bitter truth about the sacrificed oasis), sustaining causal lens through "because/therefore" logic from discovery to renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The zinc-etched plate’s "faint hum of energy" constrains Elara’s choices by guiding her to the chamber; its final placement "beside the fragment" charges the closure image, making the tool indispensable to the ending’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when betrayal whispers force Elara’s leaves to wilt—a visible trade-off between truth and comfort—culminating in the bitter realization that the oasis was sacrificed, with cost unmistakable in "the truth was bitter, but it was also the key."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gilded leaves’ physical reaction to dishonesty; the final image of them "glowing brighter than ever" under artificial sunlight offers a non-literal answer to "candor in small moments" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "scent of decaying plants and rusting metal" contrasting sterile domes; rhythmic control under pressure ("her mind racing... began to inscribe") avoids voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor artifact: "faint hum of energy, as if the plate itself remembered its purpose" strains physical logic; mild synonym churn ("trembled slightly"/"trembling hands") slightly dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific mechanics (candor-dependent calligraphy); the emotional risk of embracing bitter truth for renewal feels earned and irreplaceable, avoiding generic hope.</comment>
