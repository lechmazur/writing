<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's artistic block and grandmother's legacy create concrete motivation; embodied emotion in tracing pendant and canal ledge navigation shows contradictory impulses. Final renunciation of "owning time" earned through pool interaction, though internal conflict could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation clear by para 1 (rooftop/canals/sunset); Accumulative lens holds with sensory density building toward Charged Poise closure at sketchbook moment. Cost legible in "giant’s nap ending" line, though "unreachable" legend slightly softens stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: pendant constrains choices (gate key) and charges final image; canal system actively guides movement. "Slick stone" ledge and "golden light" cavern show sensory selectivity reflecting urgency, avoiding checklist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic flatness) signaled early with "time slipping through fingers"; deepening via pool’s "tapestry" realization narrows options. Cost visible in temporary access ("giant’s nap ending"), though external pressure remains light for Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "time as tapestry" crystallized through pool interaction, rejecting "river" metaphor. Final sketchbook image reweights "interrupted cadence" into symphony without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("capturing hidden rhythms") colors descriptions; rhythmic control in "sun hung eternally" passage. Minor register drift in "sculpt time itself" (slightly clinical), but consistent lyrical compression serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "churned with urgency" shows propulsion. Slight overwriting in "time itself were slipping through her fingers" (redundant), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line’s "eternal song" earns poetic payoff without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-weaving trope via natural history illustrator lens; canal system’s "serpent" geography and "rooftop labyrinth" avoid generic fantasy. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
