<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation and embodied emotion in logbook handling, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in peak beat; "she understood now" triggers label-speak penalty during closure realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost of leaving logbook; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through light-pattern escalation, though memory shift relies slightly on convenient disorientation without sufficient present-microchoice anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid prism imagery lacks causal pressure; logbook-as-tool constrains one choice (leaving it) but fails to charge final image meaningfully despite being central object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshold meaning) tightens through logbook decoding, with agency in leaving it as tangible cost; "necessary distances" concept remains thematic rather than altering physical tactics on terrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</comment>Thematic resonance emerges through logbook's journey but final line states resolution too directly ("she knew she had found..."), bordering on moralizing that undermines earned ambiguity required for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/color focus, but "featherly determined" repetition creates tic; under stress, thoughts remain overly articulate without syntactic compression during memory shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop with "fractured hush" repetition; "whisper secrets of the skies" metaphor slightly clashes register in high-pressure beat, though final paragraph avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light physics as emotional metaphor, but "father needed to travel distances" resolution feels familiar; corn maze backstory adds specificity without transforming trope.</comment>
