<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (isolation vs. duty to truth) drives choices, but motivation "preserve wonder" lacks deep conflict; embodied emotion strong in descent/orb touch yet micro-choices remain linear without genuine struggle against the trait's curse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (drones' sacrifice burden), causal chain intact, but escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options; descent-to-revelation sequence feels inevitable without sufficient resistance to heighten cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacquer box evolves from container to star-map motif, constraining choices (key fits panel) and charging the dawn finale; minor deduction for "nectar dusk" poeticism bordering on generic atmosphere without deeper pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. ignorance) tightens via descent into chamber, but pressure lacks visceral opposition; conceptual cost clear though physical/emotional stakes remain abstract, missing a felt price that reshapes tactics beyond the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orb's revelation and box's transformation into star map, avoiding moralizing; "wonder preserved in the city's heart" offers resonant, non-literal answer to truth's burden without stated moral, elevating beyond routine thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice distinct in concrete perceptual details ("patterns seemed to shift"), rhythmic control during descent, but "silent sentinel" and "beacon in darkness" slip into stock phrasing under moderate stress, slightly blurring character-particular texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; "faint hum of dormant energy" efficiently establishes setting, though "relic of bygone era" borders on cliché—no loops or artifacts dulling the potent final image's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "involuntary truthfulness" with drone-sacrifice premise feels inevitable, avoiding safety-hedging; risk-taking in quiet conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "nectar dusk" edges toward familiar poetic ornament.</comment>
