<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("to understand stories") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "blithe" trait contradicts melancholic actions without visible tension. No micro-choices under pressure—Elias decodes uninterrupted, missing embodied struggle with the tapestry’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (stars shimmering brighter) lacks felt cost; "intentions endure" is conceptual but unearned—no visible price paid during decoding. Orientation solid, but Accumulative lens fails cost proof test: no density shift or pattern break to reweight stakes despite thematic hints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and sovereign case anchor setting vividly, but "velveteen gloom" fades into generic moonlight later. Micro-setting (trowel, tapestry threads) constrains choice early yet loses traction—threads guide decoding but don’t charge the final image beyond passive observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding intentions) lacks escalation; pressure never tightens beyond Elias’s focus. Tapestry’s "love, loss, redemption" remains abstract—no trade-off (e.g., physical strain or doubt) narrows options. Coincidence (finding case) complicates but agency never drives deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Explicit moralizing in final paragraph ("a reminder that even in death, intentions endure") triggers -0.7 penalty. Theme emerges from tapestry’s "emotions" but resolves into simplistic binary (stories matter vs. silence), undercutting ambiguity with prompt-like language that replaces earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") shines early but flattens into uniform lyricism. Under pressure (decoding), syntax stays calm—no rhythmic compression to mirror Elias’s "mind alight," missing opportunity for stress-modulated voice in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("whisper secrets"/"uncharted echoes"; "fragments of lives"/"whispers of countless lives") dull immediacy. Final paragraph’s thematic echo ("intentions endure") is stock phrasing; "velveteen gloom" opener overwrites with mixed metaphor (gloom organizing fingers).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery trope through sovereign case’s emotional map, but "intentions endure" moralizing retreats into safety. Fresh inflection in tapestry-as-key fails to avoid generic "humanity" payoff; specificity (cobalt silo, chess clock) anchors universals yet lacks bold risk to heighten stakes.</comment>
