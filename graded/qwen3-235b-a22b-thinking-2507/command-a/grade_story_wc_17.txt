<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied (trembling fingers sifting ash) but lacks contradictory impulses; legacy burden drives choices without meaningful internal conflict about the obsession's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the mirror's revelation reconfigures purpose with felt cost ("burden no longer heavy") under Accumulative/Textural lens, though cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy passage actively pressures choices (walls closing, guiding steps); film strip as micro-setting constrains tactics when it slips near the fireplace, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory density (hum of history → chorus of dreams), but cost remains conceptual; legacy burden tightens options yet lacks visible forfeiture during the chamber revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Theme emerges organically through "walls dreamed of being remembered," avoiding moralizing, though the final purpose statement borders on abstraction without tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive nature" filtering moss/ash/ivory) with rhythmic control; no POV slippage despite lyrical compression near the mirror.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "breathing with whispers" slightly strains metaphor coherence; high density maintained through peak beats without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mapping the unseen" trope through concrete sensory logic (film strip as key); emotional specificity in "burden becoming purpose" avoids generic nostalgia.</comment>
