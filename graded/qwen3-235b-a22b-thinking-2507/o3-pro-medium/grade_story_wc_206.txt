<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clay's silent work ethic versus his physical reaction to dishonesty; micro-choice of breathing honesty crystallizes his values with visceral cost ("gears beneath his skin"). Wilting trait drives climax without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "Clay could never lie again" reweights the covenant's stakes with undeniable cost, while "gears beneath his skin" image crystallizes the earned transformation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (mending tools designed for "what isn't torn") and charges the final image; rust flakes' swirl directly enables the tether solution with sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: "stolen light flickered uncertainly" evolves to "filament latched onto his exhale," narrowing options to Clay's embodied honesty. Cost is legible in the irreversible tether ("never lie again") under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "rust cannot vanish, only remember" reframes truth as active reclamation, culminating in non-literal answer via "luminous boxes" that charge prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("silence chimed louder than conversation"); rhythmic control peaks during rust-flake swirl with purposeful compression. Zero head-hopping despite lyrical density; tension in "breathed honesty" line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whispered names of forgotten joys into bronze bellies" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "tuned" reprise recharges motif while avoiding sentimentality—peak craft in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" transforms music box trope into fresh emotional calculus; risk-taking heightens stakes via irreversible tether. Synthesis feels inevitable ("gears beneath skin") while avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
