<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses (needing to remember failures as pigments vs. seeking absolution) drive her final choice to gift the Marshal’s virtue, with visible cost in his torn warrant. Micro-choices like offering crimson dust reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure, avoiding stock defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Vera’s "lighter, not absolved" state and the warrant’s destruction reconfigure forgiveness through honesty. Accumulative lens holds—refracted truths tighten meaning toward the spire’s mirror-reveal without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon’s echoes actively constrain choices (verses slipping the Marshal’s sigil), and colored sands as micro-setting charge the closure: "mirrors where their colors had dried" crystallize the final reconfiguration. "Salt and lightning" carvings avoid generic mist tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around forgiveness’s price (memory loss vs. refracted honesty), deepening when Vera rejects the spire’s terms. Her agency—painting spirals, proposing the poem exchange—drives escalation under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the Marshal’s career-risking choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "fractured enough to live" reweights "single truth" without moralizing. The final mirrors reject tidy repentance, embracing complexity—Vera’s burden persists ("not absolved"), yet possibilities multiply, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices "charcoal-stained finger," "vultures confused by smile." Rhythm modulates from "lilting meter" to "hammered glass" echoes under pressure, with patterned elision (e.g., ritual’s offstage proceeding) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("knives forged of syllables"). Figurative language stays purposeful ("cloak flickering like torn pages" teaches textural lens), with crystalline closure: "mirrors where their colors had dried" avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "price of forgiveness" through refracted truth mechanics: colored dust visions and spirals feel specific, not tropey. Risk-taking (poetry as conflict resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"canyon wanted honesty in all its angles" grounds universality.</comment>
