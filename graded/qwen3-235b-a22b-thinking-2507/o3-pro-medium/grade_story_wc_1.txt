<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "steadily adaptive" trait shown via frost decryption method; embodied fury "bright as boric flame" avoids labels. "Purpose in pauses" desire under-dramatized in choices, missing full contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "arrows clattered harmlessly" shows near-miss danger while heartbeat-syncing pendant crystallizes options. Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure buildup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon actively constrains choices: basalt slab enables decryption, sound distortion aids escape. Final "fragile flame" image charges setting with cost. Micro-setting (quartz shards, basalt) essential to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single tightening via hunters' approach as frost reveals text. Cost legible in "arrows clattered" physical danger and "fragile flame" metaphor. Agency-driven escape route using shadows fulfills Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "creation and survival shared the same rhythm" crystallized in pendant's heartbeat tap. Final image reweights "purpose in pauses" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: glass artist notices "crystalline filaments," "rippled like captured moonlight." Rhythm modulates perfectly from calm ("frost unfurled like lace") to tension ("Dawn smeared rose"). Zero voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "charcoal smuggler's ledger strip she had stolen" compresses backstory efficiently. Figurative language purposeful ("anger flared, bright as boric flame" ties to craft). Final line avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glass artist using frost patterns to decode transforms spy trope. Specific "boric flame" and "breath-white" details avoid genericity. Final image makes glass both weapon and truth-carrier.</comment>
