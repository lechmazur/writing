<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "chest aching... soul lighter" and lullaby choice, but "vested hush" phrasing edges toward intellectualized interiority rather than embodied flaw-driven struggle during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("hush settled, vested now... secure as a button sewn too tight") delivers undeniable conceptual cost through the prism atrium's refraction, with causal chain (prophecy pulse → minor chord corridor → dissolution) flawlessly executed under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism atrium's "negative space" actively constrains Kieran's tactics and charges the final image ("dewdrops form on leaves"), transforming micro-setting into essential pressure point—environment shapes the climax's physics and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively as the prophecy's "pulse in the stone" escalates to "slithered, eager for listeners," with Kieran's agency driving each turn; cost is viscerally legible in "chest aching from effort" amid the silence's victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vested hush" as active concept rather than moral, with the final line ("searching for the next unspoken future") offering resonant non-literal answer—but "quietly vivid" label risks slight abstraction without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("fog blossomed like pale lilies"), but "vested hush... tasted of velvet and rust" drifts toward writerly diction during high-pressure beats, slightly undermining Kieran's embodied voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with stunning density ("dripped... sounding like memories trying to remember themselves"), yet "tasted of velvet and rust" edges toward therapy-speak in a peak beat, dulling immediacy by 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through sonic physics—prism atrium's acoustic properties feel freshly specific, not magical—and the "vested hush" concept synthesizes stakes, character, and closure with risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
