<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shown through action (Yun's pruning, Mara's tracing) avoids therapy-speak, but contradictory impulses lack depth during pivotal descent; Mara's heartbeat detail embodies emotion yet remains underexploited for micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("apology alone could never last without understanding"), and accumulative lens holds through density increase; minor orientation debt in early character multiplicity slightly delays spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Antique lace constrains choices (aligning compass, casting maps) and charges the final image with "trembling maps," meeting 9+ gate; cavern's luminescent pools actively pressure tactics via tidal synchronization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Yun's pruning-triggered compass alignment, narrowing options to descent; cost legibility falters as emotional price remains diffuse despite memory resurfacing, missing 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final cerulean shift reweights opening "regret" into non-literal thematic answer without moralizing; "rings of quiet color" crystallizes apology's fragility through concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Yun's pruning lexicon, Mara's tactile lace focus, Callix's cartographic urgency; multi-POV shifts cleanly at section breaks with hybrid lens cohering at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" repetition creates subtle scaffold loop; otherwise immaculate propulsion with zero figurative muddle, though "pruned from a branch" slightly echoes later bonsai imagery without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of bonsai-as-memory-vessel transforms apology trope; "cerulean regret" evolving to clarity feels inevitable through lace/tide mechanics, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
