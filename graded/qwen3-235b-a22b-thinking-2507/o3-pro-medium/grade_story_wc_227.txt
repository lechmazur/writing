<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "uncertainty clashed with duty" as Brielle faces her village's burns, but "terror could be alloyed into purpose" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, nearly triggering the -0.6 penalty. Final self-mending choice earns closure through prior causality (charm's history, pockmark practice).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: workshop stabilization coincides with Brielle's gold-veined transformation, making cost undeniable in "sealing her flesh with radiant veins." Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic breath-counting and pockmark repairs, with acid sea's pressure tightening options to one irreversible self-repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acid sea actively constrains choices (lung capacity dictating cistern dives), while the key ring charm evolves from hollow circle to throat-seal, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy excels—"tasting of lightning struck salt" narrows perception under duress, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile gear descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally: each pockmark repair consumes oxygen, narrowing survival to fewer breaths until the childhood perforations force a choice between duty and self-preservation. Cost is visceral in "lungs begged for air" and the final flesh-sealing, though the mentor's disappearance lacks sufficient prior pressure to deepen the personal stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "kintsugi intentions" made concrete by gold-sealing scars, culminating in the phoenix breastplate and Brielle's radiant veins. The final line "air tasted of storms forgiven" reweights rupture as revelation without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "mended, not erased" setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in alchemist-specific details: "starlight chalk," "molten gold trickled from her lips." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during cistern dives ("Plunged her face. Borrowed oxygen") contrast with lyrical statue descriptions, teaching the accumulative pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "quarrelling ghosts" for hinges feels ornamental rather than pressure-building, slightly muddling the acid-sea motif. Otherwise impeccable propulsion: "Gears in the floor reversed" accelerates the climax, while "gold welled in rivulets" avoids purple prose through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms kintsugi from cliché into visceral alchemy where gold mends both statue and self. The floating acid-sea workshop isn't just setting—it corrodes hinges that later become the "sea's hissing mouth," creating inevitable causal pressure. Risk-taking (breath-counting rhythm) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
