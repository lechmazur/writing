<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("jealous of past selves") drives soaring action, but "metallic bees" crosses into diagnostic label-speak. Embodied emotion ("nostalgia bit through the ropes") compensates, though micro-choices lack layered hypocrisy during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("adequately footnoted") crystallizes cost through dissolving gravestone and charcoal revision. Orientation anchors within 40 words, but "solvent" realization slightly softens the earned cost of timeline shudder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: stove embers become "punctuation," charcoal constrains drafting tools, and fire watch platform enables soaring. Every sensory detail (kerosene, bruised violet pines) pressures choices without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via jealousy-driven paper plane altering timelines, but "solvent" epiphany reduces felt cost of gravestone dissolution. Agency drives change, yet the soaring action's consequence lacks proportional escalation in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Revision could outweigh prophecy" emerges organically through charcoal drafting, avoiding moralizing. Final "unstable phrase" reweights chaos/narrative tension without stating theme, though "jaded wonder" risks becoming a label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("snowmelt whispered... feral nostalgia") and rhythmic control peak during soaring sequence. Non-standard time jumps taught early via "journals flickered," with zero head-hopping despite dual timelines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "cedar door slammed" micro-turn intensifies without cliché. "Metallic bees" risks overwriting but saved by "itchy like ranger-issue wool" texture. Final line achieves textural specificity with "close enough to living."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through occupational specificity (Service bureaucracy, chronicler tools). Risk-taking heightens stakes: nonlinear structure essential to closure's "footnoted" resolution without gimmickry.</comment>
