<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory impulses (despair vs. purpose) manifest through micro-choices like rejecting "false comfort" twice. Embodied emotion in "trembled, sensing memory had become metabolism" avoids abstraction. Final self-sacrifice earned by prior causality with visible cost in "space was him."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options when Silas steps into the bottle. Conceptual cost is undeniable in "the architect must join the architecture," reconfiguring the amber bottle's meaning from sealed relic to conch. Accumulative lens holds through density increase without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove functions as active micro-setting: lantern shards constrain choices (fed to bottle) and charge the final image ("phosphorescent streets"). Specific textures like "salt-slick pier" and "gull bones" ground the lyricism while altering tactics through memory-feeding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulative density: bottle-fed fragments escalate from silent glow to audible town revival. Agency-driven escalation peaks when Silas smashes the mortar—visible cost in self-sacrifice makes the final image resonate under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "memory as metabolism" motif, not statement. Final image reweights prior material as the bottle shifts from sealed relic to conch, offering a resonant answer to "can memory rebuild civilization?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "amber bottle mirrored whatever stood before it" reflects Silas's alchemical focus. Rhythmic control intensifies pressure: "clouds curtained the sun, but amber radiance spread" compresses action without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "collapsed kiosks straightened, boards reknit" does triple duty. Final line "forever through working memory" crystallizes concept with high density. No figurative muddle in peak beats—amber light "unfurled like a resurrected tide" avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost town trope through alchemical memory framework. "Bottle as first breath" metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (abstract revival) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing emotional truth with fresh mechanics.</comment>
