<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (rational historian acting savagely) but caretaker's shift lacks visible struggle; micro-choice of wolf/sheep bargain earns closure though grief convergence feels abrupt without prior flaw manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("truth was not yet safe, but it was moving") lands with undeniable conceptual cost; causal lens holds perfectly through Vale's encoded directions to digital dissemination, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mural palette matching saint/demon miniature) actively constrains search tactics; crimson-edged ledger charges final image where "truth was moving" against ivy-choked station walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: her parallel-drawing method forces the caretaker's reversal, with visible cost in "mold flourishing on walls of history" made concrete by digital dissemination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gilded rot" vs "reopened airways" without moralizing; final blackbird note reweights "noble lies" with earned ambiguity, avoiding false equivalence about necessary cover-ups.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("palette," "crimson like cauterized wound") modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "logic and grief converge" slightly disrupts scholarly voice during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "paint chipped around uneasy smiles" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; only flaw is slight sensory redundancy with "damp stone" and "sweetness of preserved ink" early on.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms historical recovery trope via "noble lies" framing; blackbird relearning songs offers fresh inflection on truth's fragility while maintaining conceptual integrity through Transport Ministry details.</comment>
