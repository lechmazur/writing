<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in archivist's "balm and burden" tension; embodied grief/joy in widow's "haunted euphoria" avoids labels. Final choice to write the note earns renunciation of spectator role with visceral "vigilant dove" cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: archivist's shift to "sworn custodian" crystallizes options with felt cost ("vigilant dove settling between ribs"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through photo's evolving grain, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty constrains every choice—from waiting posture to photo observation. Locket's warmth and pocket detail charge the final image; "petals and foam" muffle footsteps, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through archivist's agency: documenting → witnessing → carrying the unsent letter. Visible cost in "haunted euphoria settling like vigilant dove" reweights the jetty setting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket's mechanics: covenant as neighborly accountability, not mythic mercy. Final image ("covenant would breathe, ready for regeneration") answers the central question without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: archivist notices ink grain, photographic shifts, not scenery. Syntax tightens under stress ("Duty burned through my fingertips"); widow's sparse dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-duplicate "refusing grand myths... world remained miraculous" slightly muddies propulsion. Otherwise flawless density: "soot lifting like reversed rain" charges stakes; final line recharges "blooming jetty" with covenant's breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms magical object trope through mundane mechanics (photo changes with named faults). "Regenerated covenant" feels inevitable via specific details like wax seal; avoids abstraction while risking lyric compression.</comment>
