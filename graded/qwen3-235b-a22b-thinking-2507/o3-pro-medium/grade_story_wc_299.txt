<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives micro-choices like reciting tape specs to mute tremor; embodied emotion in throat tightening and cloth trembling avoids labels. Mara's off-page absence slightly limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance: "discovering mattered less than relaying" with felt cost in throat tightening. Accumulative lens holds—density increase through dust/grille echoes reweights "after the applause" with conceptual cost in final chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quarry functions as micro-setting: gravel crunch constrains movement, sediment wedges locker, limestone echoes charge final image. "Charcoal weave rimmed with silver thread" shows sensory specificity that directly enables lock-picking action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through one deepening: Gideon's shift from appraisal ("restore tapes") to reverberation ("carrying onward") narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "throat tightened" as he confronts Mara's ghost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "truth still rings" shifts from notebook line to Gideon's embodied realization. Final chord reweights "after the applause" without moralizing, though "failure is not finale" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: roadie lexicon ("load-ins," "union rules") colors noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure—"wind crooned...distant fans begging an encore"—teaches lyric pattern paid off in final chord.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; "dust motes spun like glitter remembered by aging eyes" shows textural specificity. Minor overwriting risk in "hopeless ambition" but no scaffold. Final line’s cadence shift ("quiet but true") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quarry as natural delay chamber transforms failure trope. "Confidently uncertain" paradox feels inevitable through roadie-appraiser duality. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via Accumulative structure.</comment>
