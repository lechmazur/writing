<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s preemptive nostalgia versus her excision of ego, embodied through trembling quills and the stinging omission. Final choice to remove her yearning earns closure with visible cost, though secondary pressure is absent per scope limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "omission stung" crystallizes cost while "hush became a cradle" reconfigures stakes. Accumulative lens holds through shadow-density escalation; fog-to-solid timing anchors early without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (kneeling to synchronize stories) and charges closure ("brightened, as though approving"). Meteor-glass obelisks and cracked sundial function as micro-settings that shape tactics, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving identity without petrification) tightens via shadow measurements deepening pressure. Agency-driven escalation peaks when Lira follows the "vanishing filament," with cost legible in the excised yearning altering her archival method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: excising ego creates space for "future voices," reweighting memory as living process. Final image ("hush became a cradle") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite mentor’s warning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobble was a translucent prism, murmuring names") modulates rhythm under pressure. Focalization stays rigorously Lira-bound; no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., "vision flooded") taught early pays off in closure’s sensory shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid silver" metaphor clarifies rather than obscures. Sentence propulsion accelerates during shadow measurements ("peeled away, as though the night itself wished to be remembered"). Final image’s "folding her decisions into the vault of dawn" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through specific tools (meteor-glass obelisks, solstice quills) and bold structural risk: Accumulative pressure replacing causal turns. Emotional truth in "preemptively nostalgic hearts risk building mausoleums" avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
