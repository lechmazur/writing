<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "condemned yet compelled" and "anguished joy," with micro-choices like the off-beat step revealing hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "distilling truths so bright" edges toward label-speak, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "to leave, I had to carry the burden outward" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("threatened to erase me"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the marrow-deep note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (saffron veil) charges closure when burned, and "atoms of nostalgia" constrains the final choice ("let them settle into me like stars"). Minor generic touches ("marble," "twilight") prevent 9+ despite vivid specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: avoiding patterns unlocks pagoda, syncopated heartbeat enables glyph absorption. Cost is visceral in "knowledge flooded... threatened to erase me," reweighting options under Accumulative lens with no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "avoiding patterns" as method to bear truth. Final image ("stepped into newborn morning to teach the world how to listen") reweights the central question without moralizing, embodying earned wisdom through sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in historian’s sensory precision ("different perfume, atoms of nostalgia"). Rhythmic control under pressure excels: descent sentences tighten ("counting primes"), while final paragraph breathes with earned resolution. Zero register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional propulsion but density issue in "scents tangled with memory until corridor felt elastic" slightly overwrites. Minor paraphrase loop: "distilling truths so bright that denial would scorch" followed by "knowledge flooded with such brilliance." Final image flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "avoiding patterns" transforms forbidden-knowledge trope into embodied method. Emotional truth in "anguished joy" and specific cost ("gentle ache anchored terrible wisdom") avoids abstraction. Final image feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
