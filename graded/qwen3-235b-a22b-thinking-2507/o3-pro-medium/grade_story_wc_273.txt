<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sulin’s embodied contradiction ("consciously wild" yet needing measurement) drives his final choice; "serene anger" manifests physically through pulse/wind focus rather than labels. Motivation crystallizes via ink-code interaction, though backstory on nomad mathematicians feels slightly compressed for full causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when Sulin grasps the chamber harvests dying-thought energy; "knowledge fanned his anger into clarity" proves felt cost. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—pressure builds through ink’s evolving patterns, not causal turns, with eclipse darkness tightening temporal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ink functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: spilled fluid dictates Sulin’s path, charges the final dive, and reweights the eclipse’s "reluctant ink" imagery. Wind-carved vortices supply drone mechanics, making environment inseparable from the crisis-resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Sulin’s agency—his declaration of motive activates the ink door, and realizing stolen time could power "weapons, empires, or immortality" narrows options to diving deeper. Conceptual cost ("fanned anger into clarity") legibly alters tactics without physical peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s grammar: crisis slows time because "the universe inhaled fear," resolved not by moral but Sulin’s dive into "breathless hollows of time." Final image reweights "serene anger" as justice-seeking tool, avoiding thematic echo while charging the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "dust whispered across the plateau" and heartbeat-timed prose; syntax compresses under stress ("Heartbeat by heartbeat, he crossed"). Drone’s humming chord modulates tension without head-hopping, though "snow blindness" reference slightly drifts from immediate sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "serene anger" repetition in Q6 weakens momentum. Figurative language stays purposeful ("darkness pooled like reluctant ink"), though "soft metal" simile risks mixed metaphor. Closure image ("sharp as wind over unbroken snow") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time physics with nomad fluid dynamics avoids cliché; emotional specificity in Sulin’s "reason" declaration transforms a trope. Risk-taking (Conceptual Repricing closure) heightens stakes coherently, though drone’s sudden archive order feels slightly convenient for the chamber’s scale.</comment>
