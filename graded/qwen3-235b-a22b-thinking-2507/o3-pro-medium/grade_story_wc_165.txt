<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Velasco's motivation ("serenade monotony") is concrete but lacks contradictory impulses; volunteers' grief/joys feel told not earned through micro-choices. Toddler/bookkeeper resolution lacks embodied cost, risking sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (bishop floating away crystallizes "measured chance" with conceptual cost), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure remains flat demonstration rather than narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arcade actively constrains choices (tide-puddle dice rolls, receding tide enabling bishop's departure); final image charged by seawater mirror reflecting the very "calculated wilderness" that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("coax monotony into bloom") signaled early but pressure never escalates—fireworks threat remains distant, no narrowing of options or trade-offs during demonstrations, leaving cost legible only at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sugar rose/grief and bishop/ledger reprises without moralizing; final image ("wonder happened exactly on schedule") reweights serendipity as deliberate design, though symmetrical volunteer resolutions slightly reduce complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vectors into tempos," "harp strings" probability) modulates rhythm under pressure; multi-POV vignettes cleanly focalized without head-hopping, though "midnight philosopher" risks generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "coins orbiting knuckles" and "ledger lines rewriting into possibilities" exemplify concrete propulsion. Minor abstraction in "lightly attentive" barely touches closure's crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms street performer trope through mathematical serendipity ("sugared rose" for grief); emotional specificity avoids templates. Risk-taking (orchestrating coincidence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though carnival framing edges toward familiarity.</comment>
