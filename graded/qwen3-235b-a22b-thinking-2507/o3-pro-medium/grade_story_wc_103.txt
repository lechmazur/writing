<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels via embodied retrocognition ("clink of glass behind ribs," thoughts blurring like negatives) and professional pride driving climax choice. Minor deduction for "retrocognitively trapped" label lacking immediate embodied cost in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("living photograph that would never fade," boyhood self merging). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening; minor artifact in halo fragment mechanics doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living bridge garden actively constrains choices (hyperbolic geometry inflating space on errors) and charges final image (ivy as "respectful serpents"). Micro-setting triumph: halo fragment's pulse becomes completed clock rim.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving time's texture) tightens through Quillon's agency—using design knowledge to "step sideways" under garden's pressure. Cost crystallizes viscerally in heartbeat syncing with hollow clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: time as "woven tapestry" texture, not moralized. Final image ("world felt smoother, unaware") resonates as non-literal answer to "texture of time" quest without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (horticultural/geometric diction: "hyperbolic tilings," "origami rain") modulates rhythm under pressure. Slight register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" quickly grounded in sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minor artifacts: synonym churn ("fading photographs"/"trembled across vision") and repetitive organic metaphors ("breathing spine"/"breathing, flexing") in high-pressure beats. Final image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes via hyperbolic geometry and horticultural lens. Emotional truth in professional pride making eternal sacrifice credible; avoids safety middle through ambiguous salvation/entrapment.</comment>
