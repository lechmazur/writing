<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory actions (kneeling at hearth, tapping floor) reveals contradictory impulses between comfort and duty. Final vow to guard corridors earns closure through prior discoveries, with legacy's burden as visible cost. Slight abstraction in "lips trembling" lacks full embodied specificity for peak stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes via "unseen rucksack" cost when Liora vows to guard corridors. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density building through sonic discoveries. No orientation debt; cost legible in "legacy's burden settling on her shoulders".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains choices by cooling air for echo pooling, while the fern-shaped recorder directly charges the final "walls are awake" image. Micro-setting functions as environment through acoustic mechanics. Dust "like gray snow" exemplifies selective sensory hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora's agency: following vibrations to the hatch and choosing guardianship over comfort. Conceptual cost of legacy's burden lands unmistakably in the rucksack metaphor. Minor abstraction in "ferociously believed in air" slightly dilutes visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image "The walls are awake" offers non-literal answer to "what walls dream," reweighting legacy through sonic memory without moralizing. Theme emerges from children's anthem and brittle diaries. "Legacy's burden" phrasing risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ears more compass than ornament") filters all description through acoustic expertise. Rhythmic control peaks in recorder playback: "choir erupted... dust like gray snow." No head-hopping; compression in discovery beats taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle paper to sigh into dust" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Fern-shaped speaker detail avoids purple prose through functional specificity. Final line's cadence shift ("inheritance humming... promise that could never burn away") earns rhythmic closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo cartography as memory preservation transforms climate-shift tropes. Specific acoustic mechanics (ivory cooling air for echoes) ground emotional truth in verifiable detail. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though backdrop feels slightly familiar.</comment>
