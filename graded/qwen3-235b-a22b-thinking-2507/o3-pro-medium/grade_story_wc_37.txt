<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "obeyed not from loyalty" deepens motivation; embodied emotion in "tugging scattered pieces... warm braid around my ribs" avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of archives earned by cocoon revelation, though minor abstraction in "cracks communities" phrase slightly dilutes embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: "cracks spidered across the mica" and "light dripped through" reconfigure options after tearing pages. Accumulative lens holds—density increase in "nave roared with voices layering" tightens stakes without causal breaks. Orientation anchored by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting constrains every choice (cataloguing under starless vault, sap like mercury in heart trees) and charges final image: "shards popped free, revealing distant constellations." Micro-setting (logbook) directly enables closure when pages blossom into chorus, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "flickering as sullen embers"; escalation driven by protagonist’s agency (entering western aisle, tearing pages) under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "logbook... tossed them into cathedral air" and "bound release" ache, reweighting memory-keeping as active sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "knits communities" shown via cocoon song’s effect, not stated. Final image—"swaddle them until they could fly"—offers resonant answer to memory’s purpose without moralizing, avoiding anti-patterns through specific orchard transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "bruised petals" and "sap ran like mercury"; rhythmic control under pressure ("branches straightened, pushing against the glass roof") modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in "trees uprooted with groans" taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fermented fireflies" and "woven dawns of blues" show high density without muddle. Minor abstraction in "warm braid around my ribs" avoided deeper embodiment but didn’t dull closure. Final line’s "infinite mornings" recharges motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via "crystallized fruit from past joys" and "sap like mercury"; emotional truth in flawed memory-keeping avoids genericity. Mirror-world reveal synthesizes prior details into fresh payoff, with risk-taking heightening stakes through accumulative structure.</comment>
