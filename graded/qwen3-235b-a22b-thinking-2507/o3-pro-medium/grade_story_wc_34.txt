<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("driftingly alert" duality) and embodied motivation ("build a mouth for silence") earn closure; micro-choices like color shifts reveal hierarchy of values under temporal pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("daylight would scatter everything"); Accumulative lens holds through density escalation where teal/gold reconfiguration narrows options via the balladeer's agency under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (pivot for stencils) and charges the final image ("locked his cans, bowed to the wall"); mist/clouds pressure tactics via temporal limits without white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Temporal stake ("between lightning and thunder") tightens meaningfully with visible cost ("gap was closing"), but secondary stake of server decay remains slightly abstract despite protagonist agency driving the encoding escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (unsent apologies as "open circuits"), with final image reweighting "unspoken needs" via "color for wishes already spoken" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("driftingly alert" as embodied bias) and rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful compression taught early ("existed only between lightning and thunder") pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops with high propulsion, though "driftingly alert" repetition edges toward tic in high-pressure beats; figurative density remains legible ("static danced across the spray") without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost with physical artistry avoids derivative tropes; emotional specificity in "unresolved chords" transforms familiar premise through verifiable details like user logs as "echoing" artifacts.</comment>
