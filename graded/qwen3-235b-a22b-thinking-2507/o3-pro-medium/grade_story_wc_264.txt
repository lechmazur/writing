<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (vigilance vs fear of inadequacy) drives the final choice; embodied exhaustion in "static in his blood" avoids label-speak; micro-choice of unlocking hatch reveals hierarchy of values when fear persists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density peaks at "became a hinge between what was lost and what might arise" with felt cost of insomnia transformed; closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options when Silas closes eyes to listen, reweighting vigilance's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains choice by opening light-veins only where clock chimes land; bioluminescent sand's tactile "petals of light" and geothermal-warmed stone tables charge final image of refracted dawns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency when clock chimes disperse pollen-like sound; visible cost of Silas's insomnia transforming into purpose ("guarding beginnings") reweights dominant stake by final line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "frozen time was exactly the soil" reweights pause as necessity; final image of listening over dreaming offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "boots crunching petals of light" and "static in his blood"; rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during Lira's arrival; no head-hopping despite dual presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fracturing into softer shades when she blinked" demonstrates textural specificity; no figurative muddle in closure beat where "sparks flitted... settling into shards like fireflies choosing homes".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of insomnia as dreamless vigilance enabling archive cultivation feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes through wave-function physics made tactile via "probability waves" and clock compass without gimmickry.</comment>
