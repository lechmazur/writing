<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "decided to forget deliberately" amid mnemonic shackles, but "auroral sorrow" edges toward label despite embodied context; micro-choices like hammer-tap repair reveal value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with trapdoor sealing on Elara's laughter—cost legible in "sorrow completed its transformation into dawn" under Accumulative lens; journal entry risks thematic echo but is immediately tested by action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains every choice: quartz veins scatter light during descent, bioluminescence enables sketching, and mineral air charges final image; "charcoal crust on her nails" embodies tool-as-setting with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through memory release—"release it or be forever dusk" crystallizes moral calculus—but "inescapable calling" remains slightly abstract until final sketching; cost is felt in emptied mind and sealed trapdoor foreclosing return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "raw longing" sketching reweights "accumulated perfection," but Mara's journal entry ("release it...") risks thematic echo; final image charges "auroral sorrow" into dawn without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fingertips permanently stained soot-black" and "graphite dust on her desk"; rhythmic control peaks in "creativity uncorked flowed through geodes as soundless champagne" with compression taught early via dream sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats; "trembling rainbows" and "infinite morning" avoid purple prose through concrete verbs, but "auroral sorrow" repetition (3x) risks loop though contextually evolved; final line's "crystals kept her laughter safe" achieves textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes artist's block with geode metaphors into inevitable emotional truth; "soundless champagne" fizzing against stone transforms cliché through physical specificity; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity via consistent mineral lexicon.</comment>
