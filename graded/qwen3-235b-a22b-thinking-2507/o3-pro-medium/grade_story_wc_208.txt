<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fear and curiosity" approach to lighthouse; micro-choices like selecting tide-curved driftwood reveal values under pressure. Final gate-building choice earns closure through tactile execution, though "perpetually learning" trait remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: villagers stepping through the gate reconfigures time with felt cost ("driftwood strewn... in serpentine patterns"). Accumulative lens holds through "turbine-hum" motif deepening to violet-light pivot, with persistent constraint of the slide shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brackish waves and calloused hands constrain choices; lantern slide's glass shards charge the ending by literally refracting light through the gate. Basalt arch evolves from obstacle to alignment point, with sensory hierarchy (salt taste, foam-dripping keystone) perfectly calibrated to urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when slide "pulsed, urging movement," forcing Iona into projections with cost (lost linear time). Agency drives escalation: rotating slide layers eras, accepting emissary role pivots the cove. Cost proof solid in "fog had thinned" revealing intentional driftwood patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: gate inlaid with slide shards reweights "timewoven alliances" without moralizing. Final image of silhouettes marching across tide offers resonant answer to "scaffold complexity with simplicity," avoiding thematic echo despite "emissary" recognition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "wood grain and tide rhythms" observation; rhythm modulates from "restless meter" waves to "airy as freshly planed cedar" hush. No head-hopping, with free indirect style ("she would learn from light sewn with shadow") deepening interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "turbine-hum reverie" appears 3x with diminishing returns in final third. High density maintained ("ships sailed across plaster, trees sprouted along mortar seams"), though "violet sky, as though twilight had nested early" slightly overwrites. Closure image remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through sculptor's tactile lens: alliances manifest via wood grain and glass shards, not dialogue. "Timewoven" concept gains freshness from occupational specificity (chisel pauses, driftwood cursive), with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
