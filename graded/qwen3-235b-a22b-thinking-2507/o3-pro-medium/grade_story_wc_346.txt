<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs mercy) embodied in "trembling fingers" and "bruised awe," but flaw-driven mistakes lack on-page demonstration; "infants cry" summary weakens peak-beat specificity despite strong final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "doomsday clock adjuster" too vague by 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty; closure (Charged Poise with heartbeat cost) lands cleanly under Accumulative lens but late lens teaching caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orientation penalty in Q2 caps Q3 at 7.0; lighthouse functions as micro-setting via "pane of hush" charging the final image, but spatial choreography lacks early constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("softer ending") signaled late but escalation under Accumulative lens is flawless: "eight revolutions" tightens pressure, heartbeat sacrifice visibly charges the "barefoot" time image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("time strode barefoot") reweights "cracked bell made holy" motif non-literally; no thematic echo, earned through concrete actions (puppet sealing with gold) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (gear-focused POV), but "bruised awe" repetition and "vouchsafe" register drift in peak beats undermine rhythmic control; no head-hopping preserves lens coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("nested patterns" x4) and "bruised awe" repetition cause -0.3 deduction; zero figurative muddle in climax but scaffold touches final third disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday trope via tactile specificity (puppet head's "vein of gold"); "heartbeat as metronome" risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through gear mechanics.</comment>
