<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (logic vs. sentimentality), but the burning-self prophecy lacks personal stakes beyond generic transformation fear; micro-choice offering memories instead of words earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("lose laughter, perhaps lose tenderness"), but starling warning feels slightly tell-y in high-pressure beat; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through orchard's sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard’s dew and crystal actively constrain choices (tempering flame), with quince/moonseed details charging final image; "cold fire streamed into her palms" exemplifies sensory purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through crystal’s turbulence warning, but "flame sleeping under ice" lacks visceral escalation; cost ("lose tenderness") legible though not physically enacted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "wick, not conflagration" action; final line ("wonder had learned restraint") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("wind-chimed leaves arranging corridors of thought"), but "ancient freshness" descriptor drifts into abstraction during tension; rhythm modulates perfectly with starling patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, yet "kaleidoscopic waterfall sending shards of color" slightly overwrites in opening; "river-light turned solid" demonstrates ideal density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy tropes (restraint as philosopher's stone), but "figure burning" prophecy feels derivative; risk-taking in avoiding transformation elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
