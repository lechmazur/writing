<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: skeptic seeks memory liberation yet doubts maps; embodied choices (mimicking geese, bell-ringing) earn his quiet transformation without epiphanies. Final shard return crystallizes cost through micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: geese departure marks time’s passage as fountains awaken, reconfiguring Aurin’s doubt. Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds—breadcrumbs to bell-ringing tightens options while sensory density reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dry fountains constrain every tactic (seeking moisture, rusted pipes blocking box), charging the climax where "mirrored roses" gush. Micro-setting (shard, bell) directly alters moves; final mist "kissing balconies" reweights the city’s bones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Geese countdown creates live clock narrowing options—bell-ringing agency forces trade-off (summon rain vs. winter’s freeze). Cost is visceral: seasonal urgency makes liberation feel earned, not coincidental, under accumulative/textural escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Skepticism served its luminous course" reframes theme through action, not moralizing. Final image of free memories roaming "with water" reweights doubt as necessary precursor, avoiding binaries while charging emotional aftereffect via "penny wishes surfaced like minnows".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "eyes glowed with questions", "geese as living compasses" filter world through Aurin’s skepticism. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("waterless lullabies") to urgent ("heart thundering") without POV drift; Novara’s whisper distinctively contrasts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "argent thread only visible when wet" shows constraint economically. Every phrase multi-tasks: "rust had soldered the box to iron" advances plot, setting, and stakes. Final line crystallizes theme without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "skeptic vs memory" trope via concrete mechanics (wet-activated thread, bell-ringing geese). Emotional truth in quiet climax avoids middle-ground hedging; "defiant hush" resolution feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
