<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's contradiction—truth-seeker choosing secrecy—drives the climax; embodied cost when burning letters shows internal conflict without therapy-speak. Micro-choice to reset the gate crystallizes her endurance with visible sacrifice of her career identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Mara’s decision to burn evidence and guard the secret forecloses truth-publishing with felt cost ("secrecy was not cowardice but mercy"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens stakes toward the stillpoint revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The flawed diamond constrains every choice: radiation meters stay silent during the apple bite, guides her to the pump, and charges the final image where dust eddies yet "air fell quiet." Orchards aren’t backdrop but active pressure—coppery dust never settling on leaves proves the anomaly’s reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: her reassembly of letters transforms abstract "cursed jewel" rumors into concrete peril (scavengers, politicians). The cost—burning evidence, resuming watch—is legible when she recalls "drought towns" children, making secrecy a moral trade-off under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "comfortable lies" gain weight when Mara smiles behind her respirator, rejecting her life’s work to protect the orchard. Final image reweights the premise—"a lie is the flimsy shelter protecting a stillpoint"—without moralizing, using physics-as-miracle to avoid simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara notices "torn papers fluttered like startled moths" through a debunker’s lens, not a tourist’s. Rhythmic control peaks during the stillpoint discovery ("Dust eddied... air fell quiet") where syntax compresses under stress without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "radiation meters stayed silent, a paradox crisp as the fruit’s snap" layers image, sound, and concept. Minor scaffold in "she had come to excavate truth from comfortable lies" costs 0.2; no figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via specific moral calculus: truth isn’t "out there" but a burden requiring stewardship. The "flawed diamond" trope gains freshness through its physics-based stillpoint, where the defect (fractured carbon lattice) becomes the salvation—risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
