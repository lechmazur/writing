<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; Mara's "watchful dreamer" trait manifests in mapping drip constellations and the pivotal seed-planting invitation. Contradictory impulses (waiting as action vs. Rowan's trembling fear) charge the closure, though "quietly proactive" could deepen through more tactile micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis via Mara and Rowan sleeping amid "roots they had chosen," with felt cost in Rowan’s tears and the "death threats" context. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: moss-garden density reweights the dominant stake (healing vs. public noise) through resin-harvesting and constellation planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The moss garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (resin anchors seedlings, tile constellations guide planting) and charges the final image ("dew rehearsing tomorrow's constellation"). Abandoned servers aren’t backdrop but active constraints, hosting moss that "accepts salt as another mineral" in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens accumulatively: Rowan’s arrival crystallizes the dominant stake (quiet healing vs. viral noise), and his confession deepens the cost ("death threats or lawsuits"). His trembling hands steadying through action—not sympathy—shows agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens, though the reporters’ threat feels slightly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "grafting meaning onto wounds" via literal seed-planting, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material: salt tears become "another mineral in slow circuitry," offering a resonant answer to healing’s cost without stating a moral. No thematic echo or false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chlorophyll hummed in honeyed hush," "electrolyte and loam") reflects Mara’s watchful nature. Compression is taught early ("listening" as opening word) and paid off in closure’s quiet rhythm. Minor register drift in "amberish" slightly disrupts POV lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mottled the tile like constellations" exemplifies high-density imagery. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("Rowan exhaled a sound..."), though "amberish flakes" risks thesaurus-itis. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle, propelling toward closure’s "dew rehearsing" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech decay/ecology ("data ghosts," moss on servers) avoids eco-clichés. Risk-taking heightens stakes: the quiet ending rejects viral noise tropes, yet the pendant’s "trapped gnat" concept slightly echoes familiar fossil motifs without full transformation.</comment>
