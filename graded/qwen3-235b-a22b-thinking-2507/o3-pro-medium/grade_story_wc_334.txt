<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refused surrender" versus "frustration lapped at her ribs"; micro-choice of glove removal earns closure through prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak, but "chronically curious" repetition slightly weakens trait embodiment during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "crisp nostalgia unsalted by regret" crystallizes acceptance of ongoing memory erosion. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to glove-removal climax, with "decades later" stake visibly shaping final commitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices (coral arch navigation, diving satchel use) and charges closure via bioluminescent spores as "seafloor sky." Micro-setting (mushroom on lantern globe) directly enables memory ritual and final image reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Mara's agency: failed lantern ritual forces glove removal, narrowing options to visceral touch. Stakes deepen from "one hour" to "entire seasons" with felt cost in tears joining saltwater and lifelong return commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "orchard as everyone’s archive" vision, avoiding moralizing. Final spore arrangement offers non-literal answer to memory recovery, reweighting "drowned coast" into "promise" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct folklorist perceptual signature ("annotated with amused underline") modulates under pressure to visceral rhythm ("tears joined the salt"). Zero head-hopping; patterned elision of diving mishap taught early and paid off in memory voids.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sun flecks danced like shaken snow" exemplifies lean propulsion. Minor deduction for "chronically curious" repetition in para 1 and 5, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes via Breton sailor ritual adaptation and "mushroom as librarian." Emotional specificity in "memories demanded reciprocation" avoids generic templates, with sunken orchard offering fresh non-obvious angle.</comment>
