<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Cressida's physical wilting near lies versus retreat into candor, with micro-choices like showing Fen the map immediately earning trust. Flaws (perfection in truth-telling) lack deeper complication; Fen's sudden trust feels convenient rather than earned through layered interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: seeds dissolving into luminous script thinning toxic haze reconfigures Verdureglass' fate with visible cost (the dead lily). Accumulative lens holds throughout—each truth spoken intensifies pressure toward the resonant final image where honesty literally scrubs the air.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf workgloves and zinc plate constrain choices (map reconstruction) and charge the final image (seeds dissolving into script). Sensory specificity thrives: "humidity hissed against glass arches," "back of her throat crackle," making the greenhouse city’s decay visceral and active in every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively as spoken truths brighten lights and thin poison, narrowing options to planting seeds in dead soil. Cost is unmistakable: the oasis lily remains dead, yet its "memory watered the city" with words—a conceptual price that elevates the final image without false hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "candor in small moments" reweights the lily’s death into promise via planted seeds. Final image—"honesty need not roar; candor... could tilt a world, seed by truthful seed"—resonates without moralizing, letting the rainbows of delivered letters embody earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Cressida notices "golden veins in workgloves seemed dull" and "floorboards onto moss" through her calligrapher’s eye. Voice modulates perfectly—condensed under pressure ("distant crash... answered by spilling rain of floorboards") yet lyrical in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle sigh," "toxic and low," and "rattled, waiting" showcase textural density. One near-miss: "laughter familiar to him sparkled out" slightly drifts into abstract lyricism, but rhythmic control ("citrus vaults," "vine-clogged avenues") sustains propulsion to the final rain-soaked image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost conversations" trope through the Archive’s seed-pulse mechanism and ozone-scrubbing honesty. Emotional specificity avoids cliché—truth doesn’t heal instantly but "thinned where each phrase drifted," making the rain’s return feel earned through accumulated candor, not magic.</comment>
