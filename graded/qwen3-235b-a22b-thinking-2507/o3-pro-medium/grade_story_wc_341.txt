<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eira's contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. poetic belief) act simultaneously in slicing the sandbag to create absence while memorializing the screw's fall. Final choice to transmit data and fall is earned by prior causality, with body-as-absence carrying visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through the "THANK YOU" clouds, with conceptual cost legible in "surrenders to the dusty starlight" and the telescope storing her breath. Accumulative lens holds without contradiction from first observation to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sky gondola constrains choices (bolted telescope, limited ballast) and charges the final image as it drifts "lighter without her." Dusty starlight evolves from atmospheric detail to active force "rushing up to catch her," reweighting the environment's role in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Eira's agency: creating actual absence (sand spill) to prove her theory, then sacrificing physical proof for transmission. Cost is undeniable in her falling body becoming "another absence," narrowing options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spooled wholeness" reweighted at closure when clouds form "THANK YOU," offering non-literal answer to memory in absence. Avoids moralizing; final image ("telescope storing her breath") makes conceptual cost undeniable without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorologist noticing "jealousy anvil" clouds, ink smelling of "ozone and second chances." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("wind picks up, stroking... with softly knuckled fists") with all elisions (grandma memory) taught and paid off in "forgiveness laminar."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "quietly explosive" repetition justified by dual meanings (shudder vs. revelation). Figurative language serves pressure: "pages puffed like lungs full of unspoken hymns" embodies emotional weight without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms cloud meteorology into emotional archive through "spooled wholeness." Risk-taking (scientific method as prophecy) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "sand gritted with mica" specificity makes premise irreplaceable.</comment>
