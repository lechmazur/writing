<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in occupation (pruning = mending fear) with embodied contradiction: Orien's "task pressed like unopened letter" against ribs while performing reverent cuts. Final vow to "prune away fear" crystallizes motivation with visible cost of lifelong vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Only if we return each spring to prune away fear" crystallizes the cost (lifelong labor) while reconfiguring the seed's promise into active stewardship. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density peaks with tree's song infiltrating hearts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall mist functions as active setting constraint: Liora weaves "mist became her warp, the roar her shuttle," directly enabling the ribbon's creation. Final image of "luminous path" charged by mist's lifting proves environment shapes both action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Orien's agency: his recitation cracks the seed, releasing motes only when he actively "pruned deadened thought." The cost—"Only if we return each spring"—is unmistakable in the vow, narrowing options to perpetual labor under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "color of wonder is motion, not monument" dramatized by Liora weaving a "second ribbon" into roots. Ending avoids moralizing; "newborn spectrums promised to weave between worlds forever" reweights the premise with conceptual cost of ongoing care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Orien "inspected branches with reverent fingertips," Liora's "voice hushed yet radiant as woven light." Rhythmic control under pressure ("motes of color unseen since childhood storms") with no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunrise coral, laughter gold, promise teal" uses idiosyncratic specificity without muddle. Final propulsion—"pruning shears and loom both gleaming"—avoids closure-beat artifacts while charging the image with earned momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "weaving between worlds" trope through occupational specificity: looms of "silence and spray," threads as "glints between droplets." Risk-taking heightens stakes via micro-setting (waterfall mist as warp), though "color of wonder" borders on abstraction without the sapling's concrete glow.</comment>
