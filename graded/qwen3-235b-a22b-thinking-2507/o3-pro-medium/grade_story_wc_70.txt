<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation (restore power) is clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Bram's truth-telling trait creates authentic pressure at the gate yet protagonist's emotional progression feels slightly thin under climax stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (alarms forcing truth declaration), causality tightens via riddle→ampoule sequence; minor deduction as the blackout's urgency isn't actively tested against a ticking clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lacquer box's physical properties (static shock, hairline gold streaks) directly constrain the climax choice; "nectar dusk" sensory specificity charges the final image while reflecting urgency through copper-taste immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore power) signaled immediately; escalation via ampoule alarms forcing truth declaration narrows options meaningfully, though the blackout's personal stakes could deepen beyond civic duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme ("mystery lights hearts") emerges organically through the architect's puzzle philosophy and reweights the premise in the final line without moralizing; no thematic echo despite the overt closing statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of copper," drones "scribbled ribbons of light") modulates under pressure; Bram's dialogue carries subtext via unavoidable truth, avoiding uniform articulation during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("I grasped the ampoule, but alarms whined" compresses action/reaction); minor deduction for "dissolved into plasma" slightly jarring in otherwise character-grounded lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bottled lightning" with "nectar dusk" sensory logic transforms tropes; risk-taking in truth-telling toll keeper deepens stakes without gimmickry, though drone failure premise borders on familiar.</comment>
