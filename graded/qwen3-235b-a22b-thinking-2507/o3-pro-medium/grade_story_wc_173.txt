<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirelle’s defiance of conformity is embodied through micro-choices (shears for untangling threads, speaking true name), but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; final renunciation of force (laying down shears) earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates via chime fragments and echo multiplication, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "alarming serenity" reconfigures cost as internal transformation, visible in "sunrise within their own ribs".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shears (tool) constrain choices throughout and charge the final image (laid on fountain), but "silver courtyard" remains ornamental until the climax; starlight prisms evolve from rumor to liberating force, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (defying conformity) tighten via Mirelle’s agency in untangling threads, with visible cost as the city’s "heartbeat translated into music that questioned every decree"; escalation peaks when sanctuary light spills upward, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "harvest of echoes" as concrete mechanism: silence’s duty shatters via sonic liberation, with final image ("newborn chorus") offering non-literal answer to conformity’s cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bodily poetic intent," "fleeting vowels") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "loomed-rooms" descent ("air cooled until breath frosted into fleeting vowels") avoids head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but "threads of silk, gold, and memory hung in shimmering skeins" risks purple prose; high density falters slightly in ministers' reflection block with filter-verb stacks ("whispered to hold," "fearing the lullaby").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echoes" as tangible liberation mechanism; "alarming serenity" transforms cliché into charged motif that reconfigures power through beauty, avoiding derivative rebellion tropes.</comment>
