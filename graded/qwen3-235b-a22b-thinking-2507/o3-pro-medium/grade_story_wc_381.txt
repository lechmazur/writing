<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; summoner's resolve is monolithic without competing fears or doubts. Final choice to fold the vowel is earned but lacks the "visible cost" of a meaningful flaw confrontation. No diagnostic label-speak saves minor deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "deeper silence" crystallizes options with felt cost ("newborn courage" of grasses). Orientation Test fails—setting remains vague past 120 words without closure payoff—triggering -0.4 penalty. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: stone footpath location dictates the vowel hunt, water flow dissolves ink into ripples. Final image ("crickets resumed...") charged by this object. Generic "quiet brook" description limits specificity despite functional role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("unmake borders and children") signaled early but remain abstract; escalation via density increase (ink→ripples→maps) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Cost ("deeper silence") legible yet lacks visceral weight—prophecy's danger feels conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "smoothed hush" as both method and outcome: final image ("world now whispered only gentle things") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but prophecy concept leans allegorical without sufficient human-scale consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading gaps the way sailors read stars") and rhythmic control elevate voice. Late academic drift ("conceptual cost") breaches POV plausibility during high-pressure beat, undermining consistency in peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops but near-closure density issues: "sanding every edge of noise" mixes metaphors (sound as wood), while "world now whispered only gentle things" edges toward sentimentality. High propulsion maintained despite minor figurative muddle in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms ritual magic via specific, tactile acts (origami as scripture, brook as messenger). Risk-taking in quiet closure elevates trope, but summoner archetype lacks freshness—avoids derivative pitfalls through "smoothed hush" conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
