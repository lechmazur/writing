<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "angels leaked as muttered myths" vs distrust of myths, with embodied "lonely throb in chest" driving surrender. Final detachment earned through gradual "each dusk" shedding of dock identity, though "freedom lay offshore" slightly tells before showing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation perfect by word 20 (who/where/when anchored). Closure as Charged Poise lands when island solidifies upon surrender, with undeniable cost in "memories... carried away like bilge." Accumulative pressure builds through kelp ribbons and whale breach narrowing options under consistent lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe actively constrains choices—kelp guides skiff, black-sand shoals part for him—while scrimshaw charges final image (glowing faces projecting swordless pirates). Sensory specificity ("barnacles ruled every piling") filters through dockworker's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (landlocked life vs offshore freedom) tightens through accumulative lens: myths → whale call → island's vanishing act. Surrender choice ("set oars... closed eyes") directly forecloses dock identity with visceral cost in bilge-pouring metaphor; agency unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "cliffs unfurling into terraces" reweights cruelty's legacy, final smile "sharp enough to cut ropes... sew nets" embodies combative tenderness without moralizing. Conceptual repricing crystallizes in "water shaped to a man" realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dockworker's perceptual signature shines ("muscles flowing like rope," cargo rhythms), with rhythmic control tightening under stress ("set oars... closed eyes"). Compression taught early via "Quietening" explanation; minor deduction for dual "combative tenderness" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "angels leaked as muttered myths" multi-tasks setting/emotion. Figurative precision holds in peak beats ("bilge poured overboard"), though "combative tenderness" appears twice. Final line recharges "freedom" motif with earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "Quietening" reframes nonviolence as bodily impossibility, disappearing island as fluid identity metaphor. Emotional truth in "raw and exact" self-realization avoids tropes; whale call transforms from sound to "marching orders" through character-specific lens.</comment>
