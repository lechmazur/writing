<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; patience is performed flawlessly without visible struggle or cost (e.g., no hesitation pressing sickle to sternum), violating Q1's requirement for embodied conflict under pressure despite strong physical specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: map's manifestation with "tears warmed his eyelashes, but he did not blink" legibly shows cost through physical restraint, and Accumulative lens holds as density intensifies toward the sickle's decisive action sealing the map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Withered orchard micro-setting actively constrains choices (no torches to avoid shadows) and charges closure; frost patterns evolving from scavenged items directly shape tactics and the final "arrow" image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation falters as orchard's "exhale" forming an arrow relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency, violating Situational lens rules that coincidence may complicate but not resolve pressure under the dominant Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges through "memory was the truest compass" motif evolving into heartbeat cartography; final image ("orchard whispered of directions instead of regret") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("silence walked like an animal alongside him"), but syntax lacks stress modulation during high-pressure map creation—complex clauses persist when compression would heighten tension per POV under duress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with rhythmic variation; minor scaffold in "demonstrated patience physically... as though stillness itself were an unfinished equation" slightly dilutes momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/cartography via heartbeat mapping, but "withered orchard" trope lacks sufficient transformation; specificity in frost-lace rivers and storybook plate elevates beyond derivative premises.</comment>
