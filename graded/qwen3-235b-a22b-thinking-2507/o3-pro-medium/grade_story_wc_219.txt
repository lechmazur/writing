<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iris's internal contradiction between skepticism and yearning for "homecoming" drives the climax; Athan's empirical certainty flickering when amber chimes shows earned vulnerability without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise when footprints evaporate: Iris realizes "homecoming could not be retraced" with felt cost of irreversible transformation, under Accumulative/Textural lens where sigils/chimes reweight the pilgrimage's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brine pool functions as micro-setting that charges closure: reflecting coordinates become chemical symbols, then a doorway, constraining the final choice while embodying the "chemistry of return" theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Athan's dissolving amber solution—its chimes and harmonic shift with waves escalate pressure under Accumulative lens, making the conceptual cost of "reagents consumed in reaction" viscerally legible at the cliff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "artificial pilgrimage" reframes as interior molecular rearrangement, with the doorway's "chemistry of motion" offering a resonant answer to "homecoming" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Iris sees "homecoming," Athan sees "catalyst," their voices converging only at the threshold; rain/brine imagery modulates rhythm from "whispering" to "bronze quiet" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tendrils of gold weave through reflecting water" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "molecular rearrangement" (8.8 cap) prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "pilgrimage" trope through scientific lens: dusty footprints as fluorescent sigils and brine-pool doorway synthesize mysticism/chemistry into inevitable emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
