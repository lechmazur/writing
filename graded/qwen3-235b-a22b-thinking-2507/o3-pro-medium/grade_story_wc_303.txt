<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("mulberry ache, half grief, half anticipation") and micro-choices like coffee-stain reading. Motivation ("weigh a dream against an empire") intensifies credibly, but empire's abstract nature limits external pressure on the single POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise when Liora lowers the violin, with conceptual cost made undeniable as "empire banners wilted" while "destiny... breathed true." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory escalation to the garden-wide propagation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice violin as micro-setting constrains choices (handled only by plant-networked touch) and charges the final image ("cold and whole, its transparency inviting"). Velvet observatory actively mutes footsteps like "heavy snow," shaping corridor tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: Liora's "propagate" action narrows options to a single path with visible cost (empire's amnesia breaking). The dominant stake—memory vs. erasure—tightens through botanical propagation, reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: perforated destiny reweights meaning when vines "perforate fabric the way destiny was perforated." Final image answers "whose dream" question via gardens singing the concerto, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust that smelled of stars") and rhythmic control peak in "petals of sound flaking onto the peat." Minor register drift in "mulberry ache" to "plum hope" slightly forces emotional arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("Roots absorbed the music like ink"). "Frost-bright and brittle" risks mixed metaphor but pays off through consistent crystalline imagery. Final line's "breathed true" edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via ice violin as botanical conduit—Solon designed it for "nature's hidden auditoriums." Risk-taking heightens stakes: empire's fiscal "perforations" leak destiny through plant networks, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
