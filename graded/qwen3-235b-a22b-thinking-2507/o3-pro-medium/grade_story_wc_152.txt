<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selis’s "disguises wisdom as foolishness" trait drives every high-stakes choice, from feigned clumsiness with Voren to laughter as tactical cover. Contradictory impulses—trembling threads versus calculated sync—embody her survival logic without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her departure crystallizes "foolishness as cloak" with visceral cost ("last chance to warn"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pattern density (rumors→intel) tightens options under relentless autumnal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The eternal candle (tool-as-setting) constrains choices: revealing hidden dyes, syncing stolen intel, and charging the final image. Cobalt observatory’s rotating roof isn’t backdrop—it enables star access and Voren’s entrance, altering tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Selis’s agency: embroidery method transforms rumors into actionable intel ("supply trains divert at dawn"). Cost is unmistakable—racing against a two-hour window where failure means lost archives and silenced truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: laughter as weapon, silk as resistance. Final image ("foolishness as cloak while wisdom travels unseen") reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity through embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "listened with trembling threads," "galaxies bloomed like secrets." Rhythmic compression during Voren’s intrusion ("Someone else breathed. Marshal Voren emerged") modulates pressure flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "smokeless light revealed dyes invisible to ordinary vision" does triple duty (atmosphere/tool/theme). Only microscopic flaw: "absurdly grand" slightly over-explains her hubris.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "conspiracy thriller" via embroidery-as-intelligence method. "Adjacent possibilities" isn’t metaphor—it’s her investigative engine, synthesizing rumors into actionable truth with emotional specificity.</comment>
