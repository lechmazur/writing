<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in servant’s curiosity versus respect for privacy; micro-choices (diary handling, napkin folding) reveal hierarchy of values under exile risk. Astronomer’s brief presence lacks flaw depth but closure’s Earned Stasis—sharing the line despite stakes—feels earned through embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the shared sunrise crystallizes reconfigured stakes (servant’s risk vs. fragile alliance) with visceral cost ("exile to lower decks"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through elevator ascent; no causality breaks, and the cost proof test passes via Auden’s widened eyes signaling shifted dynamics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost-coated mesh and scattered light function as micro-setting, constraining the diary decryption and charging the final image (light "scattering further, engraving silence"). Sensory details reflect urgency—crisis narrows to glyphs, calm admits tenderness—avoiding overt symbolism while mirroring internal states through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via the elevator’s countdown (floors 3–9), tightening servant’s agency: memorizing the line forecloses safe silence. Cost is visceral (exile risk) and shapes tactics (rehearsing compliments, hushed reverence). Agency-driven deepening peaks when the servant risks everything to voice the quote, reweighting anguish/joy under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the diary’s "Pain is a lantern" refrain and the swan-folded napkin—no moralizing. Final image reweights joy beneath anguish as shared sunrise, avoiding sentimentality; the cost (Auden’s "anguish retreat[ing] one cautious step") feels earned through prior particulars like the balloon memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: servant notices "shards of dawn" and "fidgeting fireflies," with rhythm modulating under stress (euphoric "cogs purred" vs. tense "gears whining"). Dialogue subtext ("enjoyed the ride?") carries goal pursuit; no head-hopping, and compression (elevator ascent) is taught early and paid off in closure’s quiet alliance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops but minor density in high-pressure beats ("pulsing with secret footsteps denied the corridor of speech") risks muddling. No scaffold; rhythm accelerates during diary decoding. Final line ("change an orbit") delivers closure charge cleanly, though one elevated phrase ("affectionate detachment") skirts register drift without harming momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms servant-scholar trope through airship grit and encrypted vulnerability; emotional specificity (laughter "between crash and sky") avoids templates. The elevator’s mechanical quirks heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the "joy beneath anguish" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh—no derivative echoes or safety-hedging.</comment>
