<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied grief ("trembling like heat in a clenched fist") and contradictory impulses (fear of crystallized grief vs. need for release) feel authentic. Guardian remains archetypal but his physicality (dental mirror handling, spiraling calm) concretely shapes choices. Micro-choice to nod when mirror aligns earns the climax without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks when shutters flicker the Ferryman constellation, reweighting grief with conceptual cost. Closure lands via Charged Poise—"some sadness remained, but it floated now, lit from beneath"—making cost legible through the lantern-boat image. Early anchors (<120 words) avoid orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt dock functions as micro-setting: rain-slicked planks and water surface directly constrain the mirror ritual ("moonlight poured in like a silver river"). The dental mirror charges the final image ("carrying no mirror yet reflecting everything"), satisfying the 9+ gate by altering the narrator's tactics through tangible constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspooling grief) tightens when narrator nods to share the secret, narrowing options through agency. Cost is visceral: "warm tears cooled instantly" as the secret weaves into light. Escalation succeeds via accumulative deepening (mirror alignment → constellation) rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "teach darkness the value of stars" gains weight as the water accepts light. Final image ("darkness kept its stars") resonates without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo. The "possibility" constellation reweights prior grief as earned wisdom from specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("cobalt dock after rain," "water sighed the story") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Spiralingly calm" risks register drift but aligns with the lyrical voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the shutter ritual to heighten emotional charge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dust and dew combined into a perfume of neglect"). "Spiralingly calm" slightly strains metaphor but doesn't obscure closure. Final line ("a half-spoken secret found its sky") recharges motifs with crystalline propulsion, avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dental mirror transforms a medical tool into a grief ritual device—specific, verifiable detail avoids trope. The "Ferryman constellation" reconfiguration feels inevitable through prior particulars. Risk-taking (silent guardian as catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
