<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cultivate foresight in action, not hindsight in reports" driving her improvisation, but minimal embodied emotion under peak stress (e.g., during thunderclap) slightly weakens micro-choices. Final logging action earns visible cost via exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands perfectly: randomized gusts fracture null spot with visceral cost ("air rush past her cheeks"), causal chain (survey→hypothesis→countermeasures) unbroken. "Widest margin of foresight" crystallizes earned stakes under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Towering containers function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (channeling wind for countermeasures), charging final image with "rhythm of normal wind." Steel creaking during vector disruption shows environment evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: patches signal extraction risk, prompting active wind manipulation. Cost is unmistakable in physical bracing during thunderclap and expended effort to log data, narrowing options to "change the wind it counts on."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "singular convergence" shifts from accident to extraction, reweighted by final image of normal wind as hard-won rhythm. Avoids moralizing but slight abstraction in "harvested the town's momentum" limits final resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hazy precision," airflow simulations) modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Non-standard grammar ("Silence drummed louder than any siren") taught early pays off in closure's cadence shift to normalcy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("steel walls folded like paper, edges meeting with origami precision") with clear propulsion. Slight register drift in "kinetic release" risks academic tone but contained within investigative lexicon. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forensic investigation with wind physics transforms familiar disaster tropes. "Singular convergence" premise gains emotional specificity through Mara's tactile engagement, avoiding abstraction while risking bold structural choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
