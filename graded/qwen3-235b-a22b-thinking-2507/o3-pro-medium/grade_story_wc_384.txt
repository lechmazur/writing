<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to forgive mentor's unfinished work is deeply personal and drives every action; contradictory impulses (rebellion vs self-forgiveness) crystallize when he pricks his thumb, showing embodied cost without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: rewritten edict succeeds but demands memory toll, with cost legible in "crimson pearl soaked in" and self-inflicted wound; orientation clear by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting of heritage rose thorn constrains choices (blood requirement) and charges closure via scent callback; auroral pressure actively narrows perception during forgery, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's calibrated precision under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (rewriting history) tightens via icicle-clock time pressure and automaton confrontation, with cost visible in memory flood and self-wound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through precision emerges from concrete acts (brushstroke adjustment), not abstraction; final rose scent offers non-literal answer to "can unfinished work be forgiven?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("steps wisely enduring," scent of "old gardens after rain") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts during memory flood, with patterned "stalactites drip" motif taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; minor density risk in opening ("rivering lilacs") serves Accumulative lens without muddling closure; final line ("morning smelled faintly of roses") recharges opening with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebellion-through-calligraphy avoids trope clichés; emotional specificity in "forgiving the unfinished" transforms familiar premise through verifiable detail (vowel-width treason, fossil starlight lectern).</comment>
