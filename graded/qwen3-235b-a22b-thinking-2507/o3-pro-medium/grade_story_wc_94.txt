<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" pacing and the timer's silence-measuring ritual; flaws (censorship trauma) compound organically as voice breaks precede map discovery, avoiding diagnostic labels. Final choice to stitch map into coat lining earns endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when poet realizes "vigil was over not because silence ended, but because he could listen," reconfiguring stakes via "grammar of thunder" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (paper slips from ceiling) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: brass ribs trembling constrains breath, altitude "rarefies lungs" as "exposed plate of silver," charging final image where he "carried their script within his ribs." Tools (timer, envelope) evolve causally with storm pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (truth-telling under censorship) tighten through timer ticks accumulating traumatic memories; agency-driven escalation peaks when voice breaks *then* discovers map. Cost is unmistakable in stitching envelope into coat—"perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow"—reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete cartography metaphors ("topographical lines of flesh," "bruises as galaxies"), culminating in resonant final line "We breathe so scars can speak" that reweights childhood alleyways without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in "clouds looked like a wounded photograph mid-development"; rhythmic control under pressure evident in staccato timer ticks versus flowing final lines. Voice modulates from "furiously tranquil" pacing to silver-storm absolution without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rarefy" reappears with reweighted meaning while "bright arteries across night" serves Accumulative density without muddle. Final line cadence shift ("resumed breathing, furiously tranquil") crystallizes closure without figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms censorship into cartographic quest ("scars as navigable continents"); specific details ("bus timetable," "star chart slit") ground lyric risk. Emotional truth in "laughter and fear shared cobblestones" avoids generic templates.</comment>
