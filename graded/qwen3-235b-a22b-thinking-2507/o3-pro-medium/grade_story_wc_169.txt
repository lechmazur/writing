<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic vs. empathy) manifests in calibrated needle work and refusal to rush; embodied cost in "fuel waned" session end; micro-choices like spiral balloon design reveal value hierarchy. No second character limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: boat release crystallizes options with felt cost ("fuel waned," "closing hours"); Accumulative lens holds via pattern density escalation; "centuries of tide-sculpted mathematics" makes conceptual cost undeniable at closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tide-polished walls guide equations, shallows float boat); brass gauge and kelp balloons charge final image; sensory specificity ("salt-bright air," "cool thrum") evolves with plot pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) tightens through balloon calibration; agency-driven deepening via needle midpoint choice forecloses rushing; cost legible in session ending, but parallel timelines lack concrete tactical pressure beyond symbolic vignettes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through balloon mechanics: "smallness compounded like interest on kindness" reweights hope as iterative function; final image (boat carrying seawater-proof ink) offers non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("serene upheaval," "wavering shadows" mapping currents); rhythmic control sustains under pressure ("heart ticking with measured curiosity"); purposeful parallel timelines taught early and paid off in closure convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("balloons drifted under vaulted stone, mapping invisible currents with wavering shadows"); but "serene upheaval" abstraction slightly muddles peak-beat embodiment despite contextual anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical hope with tide-science; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through Charged Poise closure; specificity ("kelp fiber," "ocher dots") transforms tropes without gimmickry, though parallel timelines verge on familiar.</comment>
