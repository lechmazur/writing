<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's unspoken urge to "stride through boundaries" lacks deep interior contradiction; poet's aesthetically driven hunger shines through mapping sound to hue and rejecting fame. Micro-choices like paraphrasing verses reveal values under pressure, but narrator's specific fears remain underexplored beyond the tremor metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "certainty trembled in welcome" reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the colonnade's reveal, where hum "repair[s] the tremor" shifts certainty from rattle to rhythm. No orientation debt—location/time anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz shard constrains choices (guiding to plaza) and charges the final image ("tremor that promised direction"). Cobalt atrium's doubling space directly alters tactics during recitations. Sensory hierarchy masterful: "lantern-moth hush" filters urgency through poet's edge-dwelling bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tremor of certainty) signaled early and deepens via colonnade's hum, transforming "rattled" voices into "rhythm for change." Escalation driven by protagonist agency—pressing the stone to buried colonnade—culminates in the plaza's visceral cost: "shoulders loosening as if heavy cloaks were unfastened." Conceptual cost unmistakable in final line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: children tracing vibration boundaries reweights "dissolving boundaries" without moralizing. Final image ("certainty trembled in welcome") offers resonant answer to central question—tremor as rhythm, not fracture—avoiding thematic echo. Subtext thrives in the empty notebook's silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "winter glassed the northern provinces" and "sketching syllables with breath." Rhythmic control under pressure: long lyrical sentences compress during colonnade's rise ("Vibrations rippled outward, brushing every chest"), then fracture into fragments ("boundaries once thought sacred, and they were now air"). Zero head-hopping; elision taught early via stone fragment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—every line multiplies density ("cobalt panes stored twilight like blue coals" fuses setting, time, and metaphor). Final beat avoids figurative muddle: "certainty trembled in welcome" crystallizes concept with surgical precision. Sentence variation creates propulsion; "lantern-moth hush" recurs with reweighted meaning in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: language as physical phenomenon (frosted stanzas) and certainty as tremor that "set[s] rhythm for change." Avoids cliché through quartz colonnade's "living chimes" and poet's hunger for "architecture of sensation." Risk-taking heightens stakes—the ban's lift isn't celebrated but tested at edges—without gimmickry.</comment>
