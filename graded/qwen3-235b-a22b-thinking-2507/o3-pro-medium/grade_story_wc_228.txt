<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (permanence vs. temporality) drives the promise fulfillment; embodied emotion in "courage smelled of salt and old regret" avoids abstraction; micro-choices like shell placement directly charge closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the tide’s withdrawal threatens the painted moment, yet Elias’ whispered "Promise kept" crystallizes earned acceptance; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through tidal rhythm and shard imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cave’s turquoise pool and fractured mirror constrain choice (shell placement) and charge closure (watercolors linking shards); "moonlight silvering shards of surf" exemplifies sensory specificity that evolves with emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (keeping the "temporary eternity" promise) tightens through the cave’s physical constraints; the tide’s rhythmic flooding creates a live clock, narrowing options to act before withdrawal—a visible cost shaping Elias’ brush-dipping choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the shell’s painted sunrise mirroring moonlight reweights "temporary eternity" as a non-literal answer; avoids moralizing by letting the pool’s fading ripples embody earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lantern in hand, he navigated uneven stone corridors like brushstrokes across black canvas"; rhythmic control under pressure ("dripping mosaics of age") avoids head-hopping while deepening textural drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "watercolors spread across the shards, linking them into a mosaic indistinguishable from reflected water" achieves high density without muddle; minor register drift in "private temporary eternity" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the "promise to self" trope through specific cave physics and paint chemistry; the shell’s dual role (token/tool) creates freshness without gimmickry, making the closure image feel inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
