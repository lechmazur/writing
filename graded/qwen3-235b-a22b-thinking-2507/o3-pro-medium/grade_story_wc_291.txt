<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Samara's face-blindness drives concrete choices (pocketing ribbon by texture/perfume) and her methodical nature enables the oil-film sketch. The empathy breakthrough feels earned through her final confrontation strategy, though the "blind corner" backstory risks slight telliness before the pool scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the parted mist revealing dawn mirrors Samara's emotional shift, with cost crystallized in "faces still blank, but emotional geometry vivid." Situational lens holds—quarry constraints (mist, empty pool) directly force her tactics without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry actively constrains choices: mist obscures suspects' identities enabling the confrontation, the oily pool demands the ribbon test, and the final mist-parting visually charges the empathy breakthrough. Every detail serves pressure or closure, with the ribbon fragment evolving from clue to thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Samara's agency—her sketch unifies Vale/Knox, forcing the dusk confrontation. Cost is visceral in "remorse bloom in the air like warmth seeping into stone," though the evidence-disappearance urgency could feel more immediate pre-sketch under Situational pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the heart sketch and final "shape of what people share," avoiding moralizing. The quarry's "furrowed hush" reweights from oppressive to resonant, offering a non-literal answer to "unifying opposites" without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Samara's perceptual signature ("perfume trace of violets," graphite tracing ripples) creates unmatched texture. Voice modulates flawlessly—lyrical during sketching, taut during confrontation—with no head-hopping even as she infers suspects' emotions through atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dye spiraled outward" and "remorse bloom" achieve high density without muddle. Minor abstraction in "a new sense arranging itself" is grounded by "pinprick behind her eyes," preserving propulsion through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms face-blind detective trope through specific synthesis: empathy as "emotional geometry" and the quarry as empathy crucible. The warehouse arson resolution grows organically from the heart sketch, avoiding clever-but-unearned twists.</comment>
