<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mina’s "cautiously hopeful" trait drives concrete micro-choices (e.g., redirecting antenna, stalling Calvin), but orphan backstory feels tacked-on with minimal present-tense consequence, slightly diluting earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: auroras reconfigure stakes with visible cost ("robbed of their feast"), though lens ambiguity early (Accumulative vs. Causal) risks disorientation before midpoint anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radio console’s blinking LEDs and subwoofers constrain choices (e.g., rerouting signal through festival gear), charging the final aurora image, but campus protests lack tactile integration beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as Calvin’s intrusion forces Mina’s inversion choice, with felt cost in his defeat, yet "community divides" timeframe lacks temporal pressure beyond static description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("interference is protection" log), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "cleverness" as kindness without stating moral, but "cosmic tricksters" metaphor risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters cosmos through radio tech ("subsonic frequencies like underground thunder"), but Calvin’s dialogue verges on expositional ("amplify celestial feed") despite silk-over-steel characterization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose glimmers with textural specificity ("dust off forgotten trophy plaques"), yet Calvin’s entrance paragraph ("marched across quad... eyes glittering") suffers template cadence, dulling escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio engineering and mythic stakes avoids genre tropes; "ethereal grit" voice makes cosmic interference feel urgent, though "orphaned childhood" detail leans toward safety-hedging.</comment>
