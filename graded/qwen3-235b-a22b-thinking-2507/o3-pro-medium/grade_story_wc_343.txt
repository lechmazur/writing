<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in 'sociable isolation'—chatting with gauges yet driven by discovery. Embodied emotion via charcoal smears as 'war paint,' not labels. Final realization about solitude as compass earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: stepping onto luminous isle reconfigures 'sociable isolation' into a compass with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—luminance patterns with starlings tighten options relentlessly. Cost legible in 'world would widen because a hopscotch square had dared to glow.'</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dusty hopscotch board functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (kneeling, brushing grit) and charging closure ('clouds solid with light'). Luminance threads force tactical shifts; 'chalky whispers' transform object into indispensable grid. No ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via density: starling veers tightening luminance patterns narrow options to a single corridor. 'Diligently curious' trait creates cost—ignoring routine for obsession, shown in charcoal-streaked exhaustion. Agency in charting squares forecloses conventional navigation with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from 'sociable isolation' reconfigured as compass through action, not moralizing. Final image ('sky seemed to lean in like a friend') answers 'loneliness vs discovery' without stating a moral. Avoids false binaries; cost is the shattered cartographic paradigm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in noticing 'stranded luminance' where others see dust. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ('valley floor rippled like ink') to urgent ('chalked fresh numbers') under pressure. No POV leaks; voice modulates with emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; 'threads of pale gold flickered like abandoned lantern beams' shows high density without muddle. Strategic telling compresses time ('Hour by hour... shifted'). Minor deduction: 'clamoring universe' borders on elevated diction but stays within Aleksei's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms mapmaking trope via hopscotch-as-astrolabe and luminous dust physics. Emotional specificity in 'routine dulled his skies' avoids generic discovery. Risk-taking (trusting chalk grids over compasses) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
