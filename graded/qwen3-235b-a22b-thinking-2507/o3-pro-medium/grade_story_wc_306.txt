<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "pocket heavier than hope" versus "silence sticks like burrs," avoiding therapy-speak. Final renunciation of certainty feels earned through micro-choices like deciphering chimes. Slight abstraction in "chainmail" heart weakens embodiment by 0.1.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands unmistakably with "rusty certainty dangling" cost. Accumulative lens holds via wind chime patterns deepening toward dawn deadline. Minor density dip in "lighthouse like a lung" image slightly dulls closure charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse functions as active micro-setting: chimes constrain entry/exit, stairs force reflection, salt-thick dimness shapes perception. Final surf disposal of mirror charges closure by making environment the context-supplier. Hits 9+ gate via constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (certainty vs. nuance) tightens through protagonist's agency: climbing stairs, refusing premature conclusions, and the decisive cloak exchange. Cost is visceral in "something inside unhooks" with conceptual price paid via discarded artifacts. Perfect accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: mirror shard's hollowness reweighted by surf, not moralizing. Final line "decisions can breathe, not ossify" resonates as earned CR without stated moral. Avoids thematic echo despite conscience's early "welcome nuance" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "path smells of wet cedar and possibilities" and wind chime syntax. Rhythmic control peaks during chime deciphering ("Low, low, pause: hold judgement"). Slight register drift in "sincerely insincere" costs 0.1 but remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels ("brass wind chimes ring out twelve distinct notes, then wait for my reply"). Closure image crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor deduction avoided as "gulls startled off a pier" metaphor, while familiar, serves pressure without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wind chime ethics replace moral binaries, transforming "conscience for hire" trope through concrete lighthouse mechanics. Risk-taking (chime-as-compass) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic ambiguity.</comment>
