<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs. grief) manifest physically in the lantern-shattering micro-choice; embodied cost ("tears blurred her vision") earns the shift from taming odds to accepting contradictions without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—the pane's shatter and refracted tears—under Accumulative/Textural lens; density peak ("glass cracked... steady flame") reweights stakes via pattern accumulation, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mica pane (tool) constrains the climax: breaking it physically alters sightlines and charges the final image; rainwashed library's "hush like breath over a coin toss" pressures her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating scrawls ("Lantern shows the pane... break the pane") deepens the dominant stake (forgiving chaos) through Celeste's agency; cost legible in the pane's shatter and emotional refracturing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("uncertainty... sat beside her like a quiet friend") reweights the central question non-literally; theme emerges through shattered pane's honest flame, avoiding moralizing while embracing contradiction's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("turning pages like a card shark flips decks") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("Glass cracked...") avoids elision pitfalls while compressing stress into concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "shuffled decks finding order" metaphor integrates cleanly with prior gambling lexicon, avoiding figurative muddle while advancing the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subway scrawls as "murmuring dataset" transforms probability theory into grief navigation; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned perspective shift.</comment>
