<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlen’s motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives concrete micro-choices (dust analysis, crawl space entry), but internal conflict remains underexplored; his flawless competence lacks genuine struggle, muting emotional progression despite strong embodied observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "cracks relaxing" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost (ghosts’ burden lifted), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens slightly as atmospheric escalation lacks a decisive intensification beat to deepen pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (crawl space navigation) and charges the final image (cracks relaxing), with sensory details like dust patterns and cobwebs directly enabling the climax—environmental specificity meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering hidden time) tighten through Marlen’s agency (dust analysis, retrieval), but the Accumulative escalation lacks a visible price paid during discovery; cost feels retrospective rather than altering tactics mid-beat, slightly blurring escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mainspring’s symbolism: the final image of relaxing cracks reweights "cracks in the facade" as temporal/emotional fissures without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Marlen’s observational lexicon ("dust-starved boards," "heart drumming like calliope"), but minor register drift occurs when elevated phrasing ("weightless burden") clashes with technician pragmatism during high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely propulsion-focused with vivid specificity ("clowns peeling like tired paint"), but a paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("lighter, yet anchored... promises to ceilings") dulls closure momentum, warranting a -0.3 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator technician and ghost-seer tropes through concrete details (dust forensics, mainspring mechanics) transforms the premise; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
