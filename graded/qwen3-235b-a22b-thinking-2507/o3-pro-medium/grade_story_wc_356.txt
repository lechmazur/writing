<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serenity within motion" pursuit, but Grandmother Nara's abrupt fear dissolution lacks micro-choice evidence. Liora's embodied resolve ("resin, moss, and obstinate note") earns her pivotal stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with villagers' altered movement ("unseen root"), but cost legibility falters: elders' fear vanishes without on-page struggle during scent transformation, weakening causal pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wrapping paper constrains choices (doodling on salvaged surfaces) and charges closure when "arrows branch into budding petals." Mangroves' "brackish perfumes" actively test resolve, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when elders banish Liora, but escalation stalls: villagers' fear dissolves off-page during germination. Cost remains Liora's solitary tears, not communal transformation, weakening pressure legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Corpses of yesterday's fears fertilized tomorrow's flowers" delivers non-literal thematic answer without moralizing. Final image reweights "stench" into courage, avoiding Thematic Echo per rubric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives ("olfactorily sensitive," resinous stories), but "wildflower hush" repeats without evolution. Rhythmic control under pressure ("breathing like tide") lifts it, though minor tics prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Olfactorily sensitive" repeats verbatim; "wildflower hush" cadence loops. No closure artifacts, but template phrasing ("Pages alone felt too narrow") in mid-beat triggers −0.3 per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower's "foulness" as mindset-dependent wisdom avoids tropes. Risk-taking in scent-as-metaphor pays off through prior particulars, though treetop village verges on familiar archetype.</comment>
