<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("bruised horizon," "failing hope") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Nara's late arrival prevents relationship-as-crucible development despite poignant closure. Micro-choices (tilting prism) reveal values but internal conflict remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Nara's hands seal the prism crack with visible cost ("trembling hands," "fragile patience"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase ("captured moonbeams swirling like pale fish" to "light gathered through her fingers"). Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor setting actively constrains choices (rowing skiff, algae-slick ladder) and charges the final image ("nursing a new rosebush whose first petal glowed"); "mirrored water" chamber directly enables the climax, meeting 9+ gate requirement through causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when prism fissure widens ("threatening final shatter"), forcing Milo's agency shift from repair to seeking stewardship; cost is Nara's vulnerability ("trembling hands"), but escalation lacks a second distinct pressure point under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (prism repair = mending hope) without moralizing; final image ("gardeners at heart of floodgate") reweights "light" as active stewardship. Avoids thematic echo but secondary stake (Milo's solitude) remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crimson even in drizzle," "varnished current") with rhythmic control under pressure; "rhythm of oars" refrain taught early and paid off in Nara's transformation. No POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Moonlight varnished the current, yet beneath its silver lay a darker seam" layers atmosphere/stakes. One paraphrase loop ("rhythm of oars") is pattern-taught and payoff-justified; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magic light" trope through harbor mechanics and "wistfully pragmatic" lens; prism repair as hope metaphor feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "quivering hush" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
