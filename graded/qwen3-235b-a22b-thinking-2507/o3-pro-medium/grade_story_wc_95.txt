<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Orrin's mechanical vulnerability during overextension and Lys's bowstring patience, but "diplomatically fierce" remains label-only without tradeoff cost, slightly diluting stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("no destination forgives a single author"), though the sundial's late mechanics introduction risks lens ambiguity in mid-beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles ("quills flared like startled sparrows"), though "treaty carved in ice" slightly overwrites Lys's introduction, nudging toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with surgical density; "rapier-length rod of whirring cogs" edges toward redundancy but avoids muddle in peak fencing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sewing needles as musical score and fencing as philosophy debate transforms tropes through specific, pressure-driven mechanics.</comment>
