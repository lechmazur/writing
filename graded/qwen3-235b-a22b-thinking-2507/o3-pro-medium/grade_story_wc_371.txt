<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("watched without intervening" guilt vs planting seeds) drives credible endurance; micro-choices like delaying questions to earn absolution show value hierarchy under pressure. Final renunciation of sterile cataloging for "quiet bloom" forecloses a path with felt cost in the sprouting gratitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "roots do not require certainty" crystallizes stance with visible guilt transformed into "light as steam" absolution. Accumulative lens holds as seedball planting deepens into understanding that noticing is "only half the task," reweighting the premise through patterned elision of birds/sparrows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cracked mosaic basin constrains choice (tucking seedballs where rain collects) and charges final image (rivulets weaving through soil mounds). Teapot constellations and anise-soaked bread crumbs transform into sacramental objects that mirror Elias’s internal shift from cataloging loss to cultivating hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through Elias’s micro-choices: kneeling to plant seeds despite guilt, waiting silently for tea, confessing "watched without intervening." The deepening—realizing planting alternatives precedes panic—narrows options to guerrilla gardening as the only viable stance, with conceptual cost in "tenuous absolution" paid via relinquished certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "moss on stone" preparing "tomorrow’s quiet bloom" reweights "creeping normality" into sacred action without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seedballs in mosaic seams, bread crumbs reunited with tea, roots pushing "downward" despite uncertainty—rejecting tidy binaries for earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "heuristically gentle" soil testing and "itch of professional curiosity" embodiment. Rhythmic control peaks during tea ritual: "steam shaping a fleeting dragon" compresses Elias’s emotional shift without head-hopping, while Madam Ko’s "voice low enough to rattle teacups" carries subtext through implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "weathered pavilion whose locked doors hide a secret tea house" advances plot, character, and atmosphere in one stroke. Figurative language ("moonlight uncloaks the wet leafscape") serves pressure without muddle, and paragraph cuts precisely modulate rhythm from drizzle to moonlight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "guerrilla gardening" trope through Elias’s cataloguer lens—revolution as "heuristically gentle" soil testing. The fresh inflection lies in absolution’s "tenuous" nature, made specific by bread crumbs and oolong leaves, avoiding abstract spiritual templates while resisting safety-middle hedging.</comment>
