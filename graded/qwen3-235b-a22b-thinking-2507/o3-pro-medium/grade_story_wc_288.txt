<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in 'did not fear shattering' (implied prior fear) and glyptodon memory revealing lived responsibility. Micro-choices under pressure: library tilt forces 'migrate' selection. Weakness: reincarnation memory mechanics lack tactical specificity despite emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: 'shards reflect more angles' crystallizes fragmentation-for-resilience tradeoff. Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens holds through tidal/sundial density shifts. Persistent constraint (library's tilting) shapes final descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal library constrains choices: dews flood platforms, kelp-bound manuscripts enable migration. Final image charges setting—receding library's mist 'threaded my footsteps'—making environment indispensable. 'Atomically reflective' sundial and stone circle hum function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ('translate isolation into independence') tighten when library tilts at 'responsibility, like tides, seeks outlets'. Escalation driven by agency: choosing 'migrate' after stone circle hum. Cost is unmistakable: shattering as necessary for 'multiplied vistas' reshapes the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sundial's verbs, glyptodon poets as witnesses. Final image ('libraries floated no longer above but among people') reweights isolation→independence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—'independence thrives on multiplied vistas' is shown via action, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific-poetic ('atomically reflective', 'bone strings') with rhythmic control under pressure ('I chose 'migrate''). Minor register drift in 'meteors salted their dusk' but consistent focalization. No head-hopping; compression serves accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ('satchel bulged like a heart granted extra ventricles'). Final line recharges sundial motif cleanly. Figurative language in peak beats clarifies emotion without muddle. Opening anchors voice/stakes; no scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glyptodon poets as literary ancestors transforms extinction trope. 'Tidal manuscripts bound in kelp' resists cliché. Risk-taking succeeds—pure interiority in 700 words with closure legible. Transformation test: swapping 'glyptodon' for generic 'ancient writers' breaks emotional specificity.</comment>
