<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's blindness isn't a label but an active constraint shaping her diagnostic method; her "magnetic calm" embodies contradictory impulses (urgency vs serenity) culminating in the earned insight about "patterns beneath noise" that forecloses sight-dependent solutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara's calm becoming the "true schedule keeper" crystallizes options with felt cost (the relentless anchor-lifting deadline), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the basin sequence's escalating density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The water basins function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (obsidian chips altering ripples, glass bottom magnifying light), directly charging the final image where "quiet ripples" promise future journeys.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: the drone's evolving flaws (seam → counterweight → signal transmission) deepen the dominant time constraint, with Mara's agency driving each diagnostic turn under the anchor's literal countdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "direction hidden until we decode feedback we already carry" crystallizes via the drone's repair without moralizing, while the final image of tracks as "polished compasses" reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rowan's apprentice voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("tools chimed like small bells"), with stress compressing syntax ("chains rattled... noise layering sea promise") while maintaining rhythmic control through the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "sunlight glancing from mended wings" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "magnetic calm" repetition (0.3), but final image avoids all closure artifacts with "quiet ripples of water" charging the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms repair trope through blindness-as-method: the ripple-listening diagnostic feels inevitable in hindsight, with brass/feather specifics creating freshness beyond genre conventions while heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
