<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stray/scholar, waiting/action) act simultaneously in high-pressure beats; the earned endurance of "gardens that never thaw" forecloses complete certainty with embodied cost ("ache softened").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dimensional homesickness transforming into belonging); Accumulative lens holds perfectly from misty opening to "frozen garden in mist inside my breathing," with the pendant's reweighted meaning crystallizing stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choice (waiting beside erased sundial) and charges the final image; hoarfrost stage isn't backdrop but pressure forcing stillness that becomes the turning motion for the pendant's door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: "waiting was the turning motion" transforms passive anticipation into active craft, narrowing options toward friendship with uncertainty with visible cost in bodily rearrangement ("shelves inside me rearrange").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line reweights the premise without moralizing—"gardens that never thaw completely" offers resonant non-literal answer to uncertainty vs certainty, emerging solely from concrete particulars like scribes' blank margins and the pendant's spiral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "catalogues themselves trembled" and voice modulates perfectly under pressure; "pages riffled by wind" metaphor sustains POV coherence while non-standard grammar ("foggy lucidity clung") serves voice without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "subdued shimmer that edges dreams before they name themselves" multiplies meaning without muddle. Only minor register drift in "interiorizing exteriors" (quickly grounded in action) prevents 9.7+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms library guardian trope through specific physicality ("paws," "migratory compass pointing toward realms whose catalog numbers have not been stamped"); "cult of potential" concept avoids cliché via children at thresholds and astronomers' dawn/dusk ambiguity.</comment>
