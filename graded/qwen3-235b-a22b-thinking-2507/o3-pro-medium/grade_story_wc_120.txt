<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong trait specificity ("conductor of unheard symphonies") but emotional progression feels curated; "chronologically homesick" lacks embodied contradiction beyond abstract labeling. Micro-choices under pressure (counting heartbeats while climbing) insufficiently charged by visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "dared not linger; delicacy measured in breaths" crystallizes fragility cost. Accumulative escalation works via sonic density, but lens ambiguity at midpoint ("hybrid" tension between causal and textural) prevents higher score despite valid cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: spire's corkscrew stairs dictate movement pace, frozen lake's "subdued cracks" harmonize rather than threaten. Final image charged by "mirrored dawn gathered into coat" – micro-setting (nautilus) directly enables closure's "new measure" revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving fragile symphony) escalate through textural density ("bubbles arranged into staves"), but protagonist agency remains passive – wind conducts, Silas merely facilitates. Cost ("final echoes thinning") is palpable but lacks tradeoffs altering tactics beyond departure timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "fortune cookie vendors never read riddles" subtly critiques ignored wisdom; final "new measure" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while charging closure with conceptual cost of transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind skimmed panes like tentative fingertips") with rhythmic control under pressure. One abstract label ("chronologically homesick") slightly undermines voice consistency, but compression taught early pays off in closure's crystalline image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "snowflakes stamping aurora with prismatic applause" avoids cliché. One borderline mixed metaphor ("subdued cracks that harmonized") prevents 9.0+, but zero loops and strategic telling maintain propulsion through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "conductor" trope via resonant surfaces; "mirrored horizon" as conceptual engine feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without confusion – spire’s sound physics made specific through "icefish darting along staves" as organic detail.</comment>
