<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through ritual vs. doubt ("questions became arrows... scars burrowing inward"); micro-choice of killing the lamp reveals value hierarchy under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: paper ship pressed to viewport joint crystallizes temporal cost ("Father might receive it a century from now"), with the compass reweighting "true north" as faith amid silence. Intercom intrusion slightly disrupts Accumulative lens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Time dilation deck constrains choices (killing lamp for darkness) and charges closure via viewport joint launching paper ship; compass rose shifts from decorative applique to starlight-battling object that shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through atmospheric escalation (shield retraction → starlight revelation), narrowing options to ritual endurance; cost is visceral in tear-smearing "Redemption" into comet tail, reconfiguring exile as purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass evolution: "truth is a direction" crystallizes in final walk toward true north, rejecting moralizing for resonant image of silence as "benign shadow" recharging temporal isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("darkness poured... cold water"); rhythmic control under pressure shifts from fragmented clauses during tension to flowing syntax at starlight revelation, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "time itself felt stitched... molten sugar" exemplifies high-density imagery that advances theme without muddle; final line’s "benign shadow" delivers closure with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time dilation trope through specific ritual (sketching questions as arrows), with emotional truth in "comets are wanderers with purpose"; risks lyrical structure yet maintains causal clarity via compass mechanics.</comment>
