<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("charred dates, gunpowder") with contradictory impulses (professional duty vs personal redemption), but Sel's sudden shift to breathing "without armor" lacks layered progression; micro-choices under pressure (hand-pressing) earn closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; Charged Poise closure (Sel's unarmored breath) reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost, but Kilor's "universe of remorse" realization arrives abruptly without sufficient causal stepping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coral pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (hollow foam niche) and charges final image (Kilor sealed inside); every detail serves pressure ("melt-drops rang like pinched bells" during extraction).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when coral demands payment, driven by Kilor's agency; cost (imprisonment) is visible, but "floodgates shut" backstory feels slightly detached from present pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's behavior ("remorse flowed out like cold ink") and final image reweights premise without moralizing; Kilor's hum transforming grief into music offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (taste-focused lexicon: "metallic sweetness of orders") with rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during coral contact, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; minor density dip in closure ("sighed, and for the first time...") slightly muddles final breath's emotional charge despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "taste memories" trope through tactile specificity (salt on boots, coral grooves); emotional contagion creates genuine constraints, avoiding safety-middle by making sacrifice necessary not heroic.</comment>
