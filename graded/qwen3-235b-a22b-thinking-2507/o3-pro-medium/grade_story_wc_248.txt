<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("heart pounding volcanic tenderness"), but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation pure devotion without internal friction. Final renunciation earned yet flawlessly resolved, missing the "inevitable mistake" required for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("wept with volcanic tenderness, heat and mercy braided"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through pattern accumulation. Missing persistent constraint actively shaping final tactics prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the ember amulet charges the final image profoundly, yet environment rarely constrains choices (e.g., obsidian doors "parted as if expecting her"). Basalt shelves and lava tube lack causal pressure despite vivid texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ash’s pattern-reading agency under Accumulative lens, cost legible in emotional resolution. Pressure lacks one tangible trade-off (e.g., time/stamina loss) that would deepen the "volcanic tenderness" cost for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "Return the ember, and the library will forgive" fulfilled by the mural’s "libraries rising unburned." Avoids moralizing; final image reweights promise without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("Patterns rose from dust whenever she breathed") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision of backstory taught early via "prison bars" and paid off through tactile cues like the amulet’s "warmth pulsing like a small heart."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("She pressed it to her chest, feeling heat bloom like memory"). Slight overwriting in "scorching overdue silence into ash" (mixed metaphor) prevents 9.0 despite closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-as-archivist through "volcanic tenderness," avoiding redemption tropes. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, though "forgiveness" concept slightly familiar. Emotional specificity elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
