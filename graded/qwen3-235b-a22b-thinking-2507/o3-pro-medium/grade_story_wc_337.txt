<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete sensory anchors ("metallic taste," "quivered like teeth") and contradictory impulses (duty vs. fear of numbing silence). Final choice to offer heartbeat applause earns endurance with visible cost, though personal stakes beyond professional duty remain slightly thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the transformed "interlaced hush" becomes "a woven lullaby" with undeniable conceptual cost (Neris's heartbeat as currency). Accumulative lens holds—silence density shifts from threat to equilibrium through net unraveling, with the actor's backstory woven into pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fisherman's net functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (threading knots to release memories) and charges the final image ("moonlight dry its tears"). Prism sanctuary's shifting colors evolve with events, though "restless colors" lacks specificity in early beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via net unraveling perfectly tightens the dominant stake (grounding spirit before silence numbs all), with each knot releasing memories that heighten pressure. Cost is visceral—Neris's heartbeat offered as applause—but the actor's backstory resolution feels slightly told rather than dramatized in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence transforms from "frost on glass" to "sand building an island" through Neris's actions, with the final foam-like applause offering non-literal resolution. Zero thematic echo; wisdom arises solely from concrete particulars like the net's "sighing stars."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct ("porcelain seams... mosaic of moonlit tide") with rhythmic control under pressure, but "drowning skies" metaphor slightly strains physical logic. Perceptual signature excels—professional focus on tools ("collapsed lighthouse iron") filters all observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("an interlaced hush that accumulates silence like frost on glass") slightly muddles clarity, though "silver bubble of seaside wind" shows precise textural density. Zero loops, but "roaming spirit snarled" edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mask restoration as spirit reconciliation via net unraveling avoids trope pitfalls through specific mechanics (lighthouse iron needle, stolen applause). Emotional truth anchors the fantastical—actor's guilt over "applause meant for the dead" feels uniquely human.</comment>
