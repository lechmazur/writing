<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("douse what you lit, not despise the spark") and embodied emotion (scar tingling, woodsmoke lifting) create authentic micro-choices; pilgrim interaction reveals status dynamics through threaded coin ritual. Final renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increase at lagoon ("ripples graft sky onto water") reweights dominant stake with conceptual cost ("woodsmoke lifting from skin"). Orientation clear by paragraph 1; closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choice (kneeling in shallows) and charges final image (sand poured into water). Black sand evolves from evidence log to inheritance offering, with volcanic texture shaping tactics under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("paradox the town whispered"); deepening via pilgrim ritual narrows options to single crystallizing choice. Agency in threading coin over scar creates visible cost (tingling recognition), reweighting "unyielding compassion" as lived tactic rather than abstract concept.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (threading coin over scar) not moralizing; final image ("daughters can choose which inheritance to ignite") reweights "scars can sing" without stated moral. Pilgrim's "graft" line risks thematic echo but earns resonance through bodily integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("cinder road," "lunar time" sand); rhythmic control shifts from measured opening to fragmented intensity during lagoon ritual. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with emotional stakes during whispered confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("waves sighing like lungs beneath polished glass") without muddle. Final line ("water that remembers fire yet offers cool hands") achieves crystalline propulsion. Figurative language serves character-specific perception without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inherited trauma through firefighter/arsonist duality; "scars can sing" transforms trope via bodily specificity (scar as "weathered ivy"). Risk-taking in quiet closure earns inevitability through prior particulars like black sand collection ritual.</comment>
