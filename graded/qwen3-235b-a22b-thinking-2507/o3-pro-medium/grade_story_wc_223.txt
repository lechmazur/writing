<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("crisis actor real crisis survivor") manifests in micro-choices like sliding bishop as negotiation; embodied hesitations under pressure during memory narration avoid label-speak. Final nod recording earns endurance with visible cost in "flicker of a single neck muscle".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the "slight" nod becomes "birth of a regime" under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 28 words ("marble of old whispering gallery"), lens consistent through kinetic script escalation to CHECKMATE pacing. Cost legible in "flicker" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's curving vault constrains every choice—Ezra's listening method, kinetic scripts, microphones in cornices. Final "hush busy with newborn pawns of story" charges closure through setting-as-tool. Sensory hierarchy perfect: echoes override visual in crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (truth preservation vs. political co-option) tighten through Calypso's cataloging of hesitations, narrowing options to joint stewardship. Agency-driven escalation peaks with CHECKMATE pacing. Cost legible in "flicker" but could deepen physical/relational price beyond conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final line reweights "small gestures" theme through "echo of someone choosing to notice"—non-literal answer to memory's fragility. No moralizing; ambiguity in Calypso's amnesty trade lingers. "Newborn pawns of story" crystallizes conceptual cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Ezra notices "tremor of a widow's finger," Calypso "assesses weaknesses like bookmakers." Rhythmic control under pressure in kinetic script sequences. No POV drift despite dual characters; "nomadic penumbra" motif taught early and paid off in settlement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops but "luminous absence" metaphor risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. Final image ("moving border of possibility") avoids muddle through concrete action. Sentence propulsion strong though minor density issues in opening ("orphaned glow hovering").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via "pawnless chessboard" as memory vessel and kinetic scripts. Fresh inflection in "history as echo of noticing" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (walking-as-language) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals in "vendor's head awaiting coin".</comment>
