<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses in climax; "silence as instrument" shows micro-choice but final heartbeat resolution feels externally granted rather than earned through character struggle. Emotional progression layered yet constrained by lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("bells of possibility" reconfiguring time), but the child's heartbeat cost remains abstract until final lines without visceral on-page legibility at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marble stairs' "soft chord" anchors early sensory constraint that charges the final image; prism parapet evolves from visual detail to proof of song's permanence ("rain-sweet fragrance"), though andesite floor's tactile potential underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the bell deadline's causal pressure, but escalation relies on external clock rather than protagonist's agency; the "borrowed heartbeat" cost intensifies yet resolution feels circumvented by children's laughter rather than earned sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete "mirrors showing possibilities" without moralizing; final image of "bells of possibility" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (altered time perception), avoiding thematic echo while resonating beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky harmony pooled," "petal carried on secret currents") sustains rhythmic control through climax; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "colors not yet named spilled" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register risk in "shy colors" anthropomorphism, but no figurative muddle—closure imagery ("bells of possibility") crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mirage painter" trope through melody-as-pigment mechanics and heartbeat borrowing; emotional specificity in "trembled with expectation" avoids abstraction, though "luminous chances" borders on familiar phrasing without full freshness.</comment>
