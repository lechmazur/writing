<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (exile vs anchoring purpose) drive micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion in dissolving moonstone speck avoids diagnostic labels. Slight motivation thinness in nostalgia ban context prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("exhaustion draped her shoulders, yet elation rose") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Near-symbolic "planet sigh" slightly dilutes felt cost but final image reconfigures exile with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden setting constrains every choice (dew-loam pressure, humidity-treated pages) and charges final image through "tide lilies" blooming. Sensory hierarchy (wind hesitations over constellations) perfectly filters tidal dancer's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nostalgia ban) tightens through moonstone risk and dawn deadline, but "restless planet" client vagueness slightly obscures tactical pressure. Agency in dissolving speck creates meaningful deepening with visible cost in exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("officials would taste nostalgia") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting ban through cosmic verse circulation. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (moonstone grit, inkless currents) avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in gap-observation technique; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to urgent during speck dissolution. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with tidal ebb/flow under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "waves broke overhead without falling" risks metaphoric contradiction in peak beat. Final line’s "new wave lifted without memory" achieves crystalline propulsion without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile as origin (not oubliette) transforms nostalgia tropes through tidal physics specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; "spontaneously anchored" redefinition feels inevitable.</comment>
