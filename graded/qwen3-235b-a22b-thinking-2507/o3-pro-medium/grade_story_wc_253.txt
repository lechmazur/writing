<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ithica's embodied grief ("smile carefully painted," heartbeat syncing to Marrow's hands) and Marrow's ambiguity as action-driven trait ("mask was simply her own skin") avoid diagnostic labels. Final endurance earned by prior causality but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during inspector panic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: lamp's glow creates "space where grief could float" with visible cost (Ithica's mandated smile replaced by authentic quiet). Accumulative lens holds; cost legible when inspectors note "perfect compliance" while Marrow's artifice exposes emotional truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind turbines' groaning stasis and cedar lamp directly constrain choices (Ithica's panic, Marrow's whittling) and charge the final image. "Engineered silence" motif evolves from hollow void to grief-holding space with sensory specificity ("fragrant wood," "pale gold shimmer").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief under mandate) tightens when inspectors arrive, forcing Marrow's lamp solution. Cost legible as Ithica's shoulders "lowered, eased" by the hush—but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Marrow's actions resolve stakes she didn't create.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cedar lamp's "lightness inside the weight," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights promise via dried flowers + lamp, but "cultivate lightness" borders on thematic echo (-0.3), narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("laughter printed on cheap paper," "turbine blades groaned like whales"), but Marrow's narration lexicon bleeds into Ithica's POV during whittling scene, slightly muddying focalization under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("kettle's weary pilgrimage," "wood births flame without burning entirely"), but "polite applause for a show that had not started" slightly overwrites, dulling inspector tension in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via mandate's "emotional void" and lamp-as-void-filler. Risk-taking (silence as performance) heightens stakes, but happiness mandate premise edges close to common dystopian templates without sufficient fresh logic.</comment>
