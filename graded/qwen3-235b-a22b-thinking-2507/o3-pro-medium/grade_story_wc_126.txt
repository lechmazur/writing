<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in family tradition drives micro-choices like using violin strings as a saw, but lacks deeper interior contradiction beyond focus on unfinished beauty; embodied emotion stays specific without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly when the sapling's single note reconfigures meaning with felt cost of persistent hush; orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipwreck greenhouse constrains every choice—water depth forces floating crate use, algae-stained glass traps sapling—and charges the final image with the bowl left at roots; micro-setting specificity replaces generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when unbinding the sapling becomes the sole path to music, with visible cost in the chronic hush persisting despite temporary victory; agency remains Selene’s throughout under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of the sapling’s "single note that promised more" reweights the central question of beauty in incompleteness without moralizing; theme emerges solely through concrete actions like catching the bubble’s chord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in acoustic filtering ("words drifted, struck glass, slid back as tremolos"); rhythmic control varies sentence length during high-pressure unbinding, though minor register drift appears in "magnificent simplicity" repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; "air bubbles escaped the bark and blossomed into faint, glassy whistles" achieves high density. Minor synonym churn in "magnificent simplicity" phrasing prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic exploration and environmental ruin avoids post-apocalyptic clichés; "violin strings knotted into a saw" transforms tropes through specific character logic, though premise echoes familiar eco-fiction frameworks.</comment>
