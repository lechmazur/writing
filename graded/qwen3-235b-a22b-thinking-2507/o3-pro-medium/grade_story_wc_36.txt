<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes when Kalen realizes he stole the Lens; embodied emotion in "regret thickened" and "breath stabilized" avoids abstraction. Final choice to change melody earns renunciation of blame with felt cost: "failure engineered by obsession."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: obsidian slivers replace driftwood arrows after corridor reweaves. Accumulative lens holds—the hush’s density shift from "heavier than sound" to "applause muffled by miles" reconfigures stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gilded flute constrains choice (must sound "where thunder keeps its echo") and charges the final image ("casing it with quiet gratitude"). Micro-setting mastery: driftwood arrows evolve from "breadcrumb bones" to "tent stakes," directly shaping the corridor’s stability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: Kalen’s shift from lament to major key deepens the stake (Lens recovery vs. self-understanding). Cost is unmistakable—"failure engineered by obsession"—but the single tightening lacks visceral tradeoffs beyond emotional recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "failure engineered by obsession" reframes the quest without moralizing. Final image ("thunder... applause muffled by miles") offers resonant answer to "harvest insights from failure," rejecting blame for reconciliation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "thoughts arrived as distant lightning" filters landscape through Kalen’s guilt. Rhythmic control peaks in flute sequence—short clauses for pressure ("Air vibrated; frost dust rose"), lyrical cadence for revelation ("threads lacing into a single forward path").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("trembled," "shuddered," "cascaded"). Slight overwriting risk in "avalanchingly quiet" (redundant with "pressure wave"), but consistent motif integration prevents muddle. Final line’s "forgiving sky" avoids sentimentality through earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis: "weaving between worlds" transforms archive-guardian tropes via acoustic physics and self-theft. Bold risk in using flute as closure engine—fresh yet inevitable when driftwood markers become "tent stakes," charging the obsidian payoff.</comment>
