<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's face blindness is embodied through sensory substitution (temperature/sound painting), not just stated; her micro-choice to blindfold herself reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in the crew's stunned silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the safe's activation halts demolition with conceptual cost ("unseeable architecture"), while the Accumulative lens holds through fractal sensory accumulation that reweights the dominant stake by the dome's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The observatory dome's curvature directly constrains Liora's concentric painting technique, and the "plaster flakes like unmapped stars" motif charges the final image where dust motes become constellations, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: sensory density builds until the dome "transforms into an inward cosmos," with the demolition deadline tightening tactics through Liora's blindfolded choice that carries visible cost in the foreman's incoherent radio call.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The final image ("sky folding forever into itself") resonates as a non-literal answer to transcending sight, avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise through Liora's lifelong limitation becoming her artistic strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "letting canvas dropcloth guide her soles," with rhythmic control modulating from slow metronome to "hours dissolved," and the coin's "microscopic ridges" teaching the fractal pattern paid off in the dome's painting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multi-tasks ("plaster flakes littered the floor like unmapped stars" establishes setting while charging sky motif), with no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the crew's arrival under "vibrating silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "disabled artist" trope through specific constraints (face blindness + coin blueprint), with emotional truth in painting "the melancholy held between twin storm fronts" avoiding abstraction while synthesizing sensory innovation.</comment>
