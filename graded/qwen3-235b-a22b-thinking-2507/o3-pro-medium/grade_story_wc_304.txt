<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra's embodied contradiction ("balanced, lucidly watchful") and micro-choices (breath-catching the phrase) reveal her hierarchy of values. Absence of diagnostic label-speak; flaw is Admiral Vey's purely functional presence as object, not character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "oblivion still hovered, annoyed at losing even this sliver of dominion" crystallizes the stakes. Accumulative lens holds from opening sensory accumulation through to aurora's final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora constrains every choice (dimming lights to harness its light, emerald's refraction), directly charging the final image where it "rearranged its greens like flags." Skyborne grotto isn't backdrop but active pressure source.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("beauty outliving breath") tightens through Lysandra's agency: her balancing act at the "threshold of stillness" narrows options with felt cost ("oblivion still hovered"). Escalation is pressure-driven deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("map only night could read"), avoiding moralizing. Final aurora image reweights "victory too small for history, yet infinite to the heart" as resonant non-literal answer to "beauty outliving breath."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow-crackle, comet-hiss") and rhythmic control under pressure ("She caught the phrase in her breath"). Purposeful compression (static patterns) taught early and paid off in closure's "garden where sparks slept."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("Color seeped inward rather than outward") with propulsion. Figurative language ("lungs of a sleeping god") serves pressure without muddle. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Beautician mortician" trope transformed through skyborne grotto specificity. Risk-taking (radio static as memory conduit) heightens emotional truth of "echo of a life remembering itself" without gimmickry.</comment>
