<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—grief sharpening compass into spike versus leaving sextant as "brass ambition"—drive final descent choice. Embodied emotion ("sun burn answers onto my scalp") avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice of discarding sextant reveals hierarchy of values with soul-cracking cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation flawless by line 3 (Balcony Twelve, gate rusted shut). Closure is Charged Poise: "sun write across my palms: 'show me the road'" with visceral cost ("hinge in my own soul must crack"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as pattern-density deepens into light-path revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Turtle shells actively constrain choices—barnacle towers block paths, pattern languages dictate movement. Final image of city as "fragile map drawn on moving flesh" charges setting with cost. Only minor deduction: plastron's "Listening Vault" lacks tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when reed whistle sings forbidden note, shuddering turtles and revealing Elyth's coordinates. Cost is conceptual—accepting expedition "waiting for right question"—forcing descent alone. Agency clear: hand-spirals prompt mirror response; "hunger" at erased patterns slightly abstracts peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: gates rust but "questions are doors in light." Final line avoids moralizing, reweighting premise via "sun write across my palms." "Dreams plot truer courses" edges near thematic echo but saved by character-specific belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: cartographer notices "amber triangles," "caramel shallows." Rhythm modulates from molasses-slow ("noon pours molten light") to staccato ("air quivers"). Zero filter verbs; even "hunger" ties sensation to profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "sap crystals inside begin to crack and sing" slightly weakens immediacy with "begin," but singing whistle's causal role justifies near-perfection. Every line advances density: "barnacle towers shimmer like broken obelisks" implies navigation hazard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes through cartographer lens—"spiral growth on living carapace" defines conflict. Watchers as "stone prophets" communicating via light-patterns feels fresh, not derivative. "Spearpoints of glass" echoes slightly but execution is singular.</comment>
