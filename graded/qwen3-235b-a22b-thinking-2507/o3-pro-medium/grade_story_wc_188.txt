<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (playfulness/gravity) manifest in embodied micro-choices like pocketing the rag knot; final cinder-scattering earns closure with visible cost as the fortress mood tilts. No diagnostic labels dilute Cyril's "serious playfulness" under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "gravity would fail tonight" crystallizes conceptual cost through the rose-snow fulfillment of the mosaic command. Accumulative lens (chant density, sensory accumulation) holds from first rhythm-measured steps to the outvoted gravity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming fortress constrains every choice: roses slacken hopelessness yet enable the rebellion's trigger, while the mosaic physically shapes the climax. Final rose-snow image charges closure by fulfilling "Rise when roses fall" with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Cyril's agency—chant evolution from doubt-filtering to rebellion ignition narrows options toward the cinder-scattering climax. Conceptual cost ("gravity an opinion") is legible in the drawbridge-lowering and outvoted gravity, driven by his actions not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through perforated star charts: rebellion as "inverting despair" avoids moralizing via the resonant final image. "Gravity outvoted" offers non-literal answer to hopelessness without abstraction, with rose snow fulfilling the mosaic’s promise through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "fingers smelling faintly of black powder" and rhythm-driven compression during ignition. Voice modulates perfectly under stress—short cadences for flint-striking versus lyrical "petals drifted like colored snow"—with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances momentum. "Birthing a bouquet of embers" exemplifies textural density without muddle. Final line’s rhythmic punch ("gravity had always been an opinion; tonight, it was officially outvoted") crystallizes theme with flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through pyrotechnic specificity: "kerosene rag knot" enables silent ignition, while "map nonexistent stars" reframes the princess’s role. Emotional truth in "gravity of hopelessness" avoids generic templates through lived detail.</comment>
