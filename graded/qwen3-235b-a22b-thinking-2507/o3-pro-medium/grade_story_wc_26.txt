<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eira's "preserve hope" motive versus risking departure, embodied through trembling hands and tear-watered vines; no stock phrasing despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Eira's soaked return and the stone's "heaviness with possibility" crystallize the metamorphosis stake under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The river stone constrains every key choice—from peddler's gesture to final projection—and charges the closure image with "glowing like memory of flow," avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Eira chooses descent despite "no bookbinder may cross back," with cost made legible through her trembling palms and the library's rain charter, driving agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment>Theme emerges through "luminous regret" reweighted by the river stone's flickering images, avoiding moralizing; the final "keep noticing dusk" traces hope's persistence without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dew-dropped inkwells" and "shadow unbound seeped," with rhythmic control intensifying during the reservoir observation; no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "pulsing with borrowed curve of sunset" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor synonym churn in "softly deliberate grace"/"proofreading gravity" deducts 0.2 without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest with metamorphosis myth via "obsolete passwords" coat and "flowering folios," resisting abstraction; emotional specificity in Eira's weeping over reservoirs that "remember valleys" elevates tropes.</comment>
