<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maro’s "scheming pacifist" paradox drives credible micro-choices (e.g., using broken music box as tactile persuasion), but Tyra’s resentment-to-release arc risks slight abstraction despite embodied details like ash-scarred maps. "Cellular memory" concept nearly slips into therapy-speak but is redeemed by the vibration’s physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Tyra’s unknotted resentment makes "the horizon breathe," with visible cost in her chest tightening/loosening and the sanctuary dissolving. Orientation is secured by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts in "shifting grace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary functions as micro-setting—quartz altar and liquid halos directly constrain choices (e.g., vibration transmission through brass shell). Final image of wind "humming a lullaby" charges closure by reweighting silence as active force, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resentment vs. release stake tightens via Tyra’s tactile engagement with the music box, narrowing options to endurance or surrender. Cost is unmistakable in her "internal clasp" turning and the rivers returning to burned fields, driving agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Tyra’s map ("so that your map may again include you") and the final wind lullaby—no moralizing. Central question ("Release him... for yourself") is answered resonantly via rivers washing "charcoal into fertile silt," avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maro’s perceptual signature ("absence of echo could feel like thunder") shines, but "convince the cells" edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful (e.g., "tears dropped soundlessly... each one a seed"), though slight register drift in "cellular memory" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rattling like a tooth in a skull" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor risk: "translucent ivy" metaphor slightly overwrites but is saved by context. Final line’s "lullaby too soft for anger to hear" crystallizes rhythm without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms pacifism tropes via "scheming midwifery" and cellular memory mechanics. Specificity anchors universals: Tyra’s brother braiding hair pre-war makes the map’s "white emptiness" viscerally fresh. Avoids safety middle with "cartographic erasures" as emotional wound.</comment>
