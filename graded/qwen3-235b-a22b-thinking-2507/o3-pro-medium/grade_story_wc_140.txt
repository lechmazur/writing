<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "stealing or reclaiming" tension and embodied throat-memory of poison; micro-choices like following turquoise paint drips reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks one visible flaw-compounded mistake under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: "staying nameless so stories speak louder" crystallizes the endurance with identity sacrifice. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly as fragments braiding into archive. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting that constrains choice (identical corridors navigated via paint drips) and charges final image (labyrinth rearranging). Tide's physical erasure of footprints directly enables the survival tactic, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when footsteps force deeper container navigation, narrowing options to following paint trails. Cost is legible in "identity remains optional" renunciation. Agency drives escalation via sensory perception choices, though the whispered confrontation lacks one tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of warming poison label reweights "texture precedes meaning" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gulls eating ledgers, embossed notebook pages. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction through relentless sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sounds arrive first, images later") modulates under pressure with rhythmic compression during footsteps. Voice remains anchored in character lexicon; no head-hopping. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's tactile resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "strands of turquoise paint" metaphor sustains physical logic while advancing plot. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly with tension (e.g., fragmented "I duck... listen" vs. flowing closure). Minor register drift in "methodology mirrors mine" avoids penalty through character consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "erased history" trope through specific port mechanics (manifest deletions, gull-eaten ledgers) and the lethal precision of clerical flaws. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the archive-as-heartbeat synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
