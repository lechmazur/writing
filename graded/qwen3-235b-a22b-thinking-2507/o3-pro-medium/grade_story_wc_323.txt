<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's penance-driven motivation is embodied through the Knot's creation and teaching, but interior contradiction remains underdeveloped; his final realization lacks the layered emotional cost required for 9.0 despite strong micro-choices like the lantern-scattering demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the alien-lighthouse revelation reconfiguring meaning, but the conceptual cost ("permanent night") feels stated rather than viscerally dramatized in the final image; accumulative lens holds yet stakes lack tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The benthic city's algaic luminescence and basalt halls function as micro-setting that actively constrains navigation choices, while the Horizon Knot charges the final image through its upward-lighting geometry—exactly meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas's agency in vector calculations, culminating in the trench alignment that narrows options to investigation; the hush after discovery delivers unmistakable conceptual cost, though the "permanent night" consequence remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the Horizon Knot's dual star-chart/shell imagery, with the final "unfolded horizons" realization reweighting the premise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by making geometry the answer to "how do we navigate the unknown?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in navigation-focused details ("angular whispers," "water logic into stellar grammar"), though minor register drift occurs in "infinitesimal tips"; rhythmic control sustains pressure through the vector-convergence climax without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with phrases like "chalky cephalopod ink" and "barnacle resin rebreathers" avoiding overwriting; slight density dip in "perpetual midnight" description prevents 9.0, but zero loops or scaffold maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms underwater-exile tropes through the Horizon Knot's ingenious lunar-steel physics, synthesizing navigation pedagogy and alien contact into an inevitable emotional truth; risk-taking in benthic astronomy feels freshly grounded in Silas's penance.</comment>
