<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira's conjectures ("paths chose to vanish" vs. "burden of unspoken emotions") with embodied cost in "taste of copper" and "flavor of forgotten names" during pivotal pool scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: restored paths stretch "beyond the cave" while "dusk-lit elation still respects loss," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density shift in the seed-glyph alignment beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crater glass and crystal geode actively constrain choices (glyph alignment requires pool reflection) and charge the final image where "steps echo with restored stories," meeting 9+ gate via tool-as-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira's agency: her conjecture ("paths consumed by unspoken emotions") directly enables the glyph-restoration tactic, with cost ("taste of copper") legible during the pool-dipping climax under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: emotions fusing with absences ("sorrow with honey-yellow hope") reweights the central question without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer via the "delicate map of glimmering paths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in marine lexicon ("tideline," "refracted tides") and rhythmic control during high-pressure pool scene where syntax compresses ("dipped a fingertip," "concentric ripples ripple") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density ("sorrow with honey-yellow hope, fear with silver curiosity") achieves conceptual clarity through concrete imagery, with final line’s "missing footprint" charging closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through specific mechanics (crater glass preserving "fragile hush," seeds as accidental cartography), avoiding abstraction with verifiable details like "siskin" and "quartz ribs" that resist swappability.</comment>
