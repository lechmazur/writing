<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (theatrical sincerity vs. vulnerability) act simultaneously during lock-picking; final choice to write Silence Type IX is earned by cataloging process with visible cost (tears blurring ink). Slight risk of over-articulated epiphany mitigated by concrete action of writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when diary's thesis reweights silence as presence of understanding; cost is unmistakable in "tears blurred the ink" under Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint (fragile diary) shapes every tactical choice from fork selection to humming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Diary clasp functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (forcing sub-audible method) and charges final image (absorbing firework boom as proof peace echoes louder). Sensory details like "sigh softer than candle smoke" reflect character's acoustic bias without tourist-cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency through three tightening beats (G fork mapping stress fracture → glass fork crumbling rust → humming chord resolving psychic latch), each narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in emotional concession during "Heart Conceding Applause" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of diary absorbing firework boom offers resonant answer to "path to empathy" without moralizing; Oriel's thesis emerges diegetically as earned insight rather than authorial sermon. Theme avoids binaries by showing empathy as active overlap, not passive absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in acoustic imagery ("sapphire hue" for vibration, "candle smoke sigh") remains consistent under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical cataloging to fragmented revelation ("Tears blurred the ink"). Zero head-hopping despite theatrical self-consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture (e.g., "petals of oxidized brass separating without protest" fuses action, metaphor, and stakes). Figurative language remains precise in peak beats—no muddle when describing "emotional harmonics" or "psychic latch".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "cataloging silence" trope through acoustic physics and emotional specificity; risk-taking heightens stakes by making climax internal (humming chord resolving regret) rather than physical. Non-obvious angle where peace echoes louder via diary absorbing boom.</comment>
