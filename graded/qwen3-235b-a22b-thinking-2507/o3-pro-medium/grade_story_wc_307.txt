<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rowan’s impatience and Mira’s reverse aging drive authentic micro-choices (e.g., shame at showing impatience, stepping into the circle only when desire dies). Contradictory impulses—hunger for secrets vs. surrender—culminate in earned vanishing with felt cost (terror dissolving into dissolution).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rowan’s vanishing reweights absence as "perfect arrival" with conceptual cost (physical presence sacrificed for understanding). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (grotto’s thrum, sycamore hush) to crystallize stakes in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto’s iron dust constrains choices (vibrating pebble, thrumming during vanishing) and charges closure via rewinding ripples becoming "mirror, lesson becoming seed." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Rowan’s pulse quieted by hush during crisis—avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation hinges on Rowan’s agency: pacing the chalk circle’s rim until exhaustion forces surrender, narrowing options to "stepping without desire." Cost is visceral (terror, dissolution) and conceptual (presence sacrificed for understanding), deepening under Accumulative lens via the grotto’s intensifying thrum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: vanishing as "perfect arrival" reweights absence via the pond’s backwards ripples converging to self-absence. No moralizing—the final image ("lesson becoming seed") resonates non-literally, avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "iron dust that sang," "cicadas stitching minutes." Rhythm compresses under stress ("Terror fluttered, but the sycamore hush poured downward"). No head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical ("Night breathed") to visceral during transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances momentum (e.g., "rings unfurled across the water like breathing diagrams" merges action/image). Minor figurative muddle in "wisdom pooled behind her young eyes like an ember in wind" slightly dulls immediacy in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mentor-apprentice trope via reverse aging and concrete mechanics of vanishing. The "chalk circle" device feels inevitable—Rowan’s surrender reconfigures stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence, with closure’s "silhouette of possibility" feeling earned.</comment>
