<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in contradictory impulses (artistic ambition vs. inherited grief) crystallizes in the mural's creation; tears of "continuation" reveal earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the fading mural's "memory lingered wherever silence layered itself," with conceptual cost (grandfather's unfulfilled quest becoming Maris' legacy) under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Etched glass microfiligree constrains Maris' choice (angle-dependent animation), charging the final image where "petals of luminous paint unfurled" breathe with the cathedral's "umbral tenderness."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory escalation (postcards → cathedral window → mural), narrowing options to a single act of creation; cost is visceral in Maris' realization that curiosity "crossed into hers" as winter melts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights "flowers bloom at night" into communion through the mural's ephemeral glow, avoiding moralizing while answering the grandfather's question with resonant, non-literal truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "petals yawning open under stars like mouths telling quiet truths"; voice modulates from hushed cathedral to streetlamp-humming urgency without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Liquid brass" light and "pulse in her sternum" achieve high density without muddle; minor overwriting risk in "umbral tenderness" repetition offsets by rhythmic control in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes night-blooming botany with artistic legacy into fresh "communion" thesis; risk-taking in luminous mural mechanics feels inevitable through cathedral window groundwork.</comment>
