<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (precision vs guilt) drive the Clara lie confession; embodied cost in "heart paused as completely as the pendulum." Slight underdevelopment of the lie's emotional weight prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("Time, it seemed, inhaled") with undeniable cost in "heart paused," sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("tidal obsidian ridge... before dawn") avoid penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge actively pressures choices (rising tide forces confession) and charges closure ("cadence softened"). Micro-setting (rake handle) constrains tactics via inscriptions; no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency (speaking truth) under Accumulative lens, with visceral cost in "heart paused." Tide's rise forces the Clara confession, narrowing options meaningfully for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial metaphor ("sand filling a vial") and final image ("balance... unarguable as gravity"), avoiding moralizing. Non-literal answer to "incremental absolution" reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("basalt sang," "burning mirrors") reflects Elias's precision; rhythmic control in "hush between waves" deepens pressure. No POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "microfractures... healed with glowing veins" shows high density. Minor abstraction in "blurred cliff, sea, and conscience" prevents 9.5 but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timekeeping as moral calculus; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes. "Incremental absolution" feels inevitable through rake handle particulars, avoiding trope.</comment>
