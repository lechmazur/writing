<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "debris circling a black hole" vs plow vision; embodied cost in numbing toes and gravel bites. Avoids diagnostic label-speak despite thematic density. Final choice earned by breath-aligned hum, but "rearranging silence into questions" slightly over-articulated for crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "rebellion felt less like war... stage waiting for new choreography" crystallizes stance with cost in soldier's bark and closing daylight margin. Accumulative lens holds; "thunder rolled... sky remembering its voice" proves cost legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opera glasses and stone circle constrain choices (barefoot necessity, satellite reprogramming vision) and charge final image as "compass forged from theatre and starlight." Micro-setting functions as environment—gravel biting like questions embodies stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake "why rebel?" tightens via hum's modulation into plow vision, narrowing options as daylight closes. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; cost legible in lull's end ("margin of daylight was closing"). No coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "constellations within the mess," not moralizing. Final line "sketched the first line" reweights rebellion as choreography without stating morals. Avoids Thematic Echo; ambiguity lingers in "satellites that could sow seeds."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "crickets whispered," "sirens of lost machinery sighed." Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn to urgent "gravel biting." No head-hopping; "accidentally laughing" shows stress-compressed diction. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thunderous serenity" avoids cliché. "Captive nebulae" borders on overwriting but consistent with voice. Final third propulsion flawless—"flick of thrusters answered her gaze" crystallizes hope without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spaceport rebellion meets stone circle mysticism. "Thunderous serenity" transforms war trope; specificity in "frozen lubricant stalactites" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
