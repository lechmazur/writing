<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("uncertainly certain") drives credible endurance; smashing compass earns renunciation through prior causality. Slight over-articulation of philosophy ("befriend uncertainty") risks therapy-speak but avoids diagnostic labels. Micro-choices like comparing handwriting reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: smashing compass creates visible cost ("vault lights died") while reconfiguring options toward uncertainty. Accumulative lens holds via density increase (locker logs → sand table) with coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization. Minor lens ambiguity early but resolved by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Waterfall mist's "rainbow ghosts" charges final image of rain-kissed roof, constraining choice (stepping through cascade). Soot-as-blueprints detail evolves causally with events. Near-flawless but "liquid thunder" description slightly stalls momentum in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("befriend uncertainty in planning") and escalated through Milo's agency (descending staircase, stepping into waterfall). Cost unmistakable: destroying compass sacrifices solution to preserve living patterns. Single deepening ("recording broke rhythm") narrows options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ending reweights theme via rain's "rhythmic yet unpredictable" music—a non-literal answer to "befriending uncertainty." Avoids moralizing; "clarity lives in motion" emerges from concrete actions. Child's "Again" sketch crystallizes conceptual cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("leaves brush his face like restless clocks"), with rhythmic compression during tension ("Dusk swallowed the room"). Minor register drift in "unruly prisoners of probability" jars against tinkerer voice. Consistent psychic distance enhances lyrical cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in "soot that looked suspiciously like cremated blueprints" but figurative strings risk overwriting in waterfall beat ("liquid thunder," "rainbow ghosts"). Zero loops; final image propulsion flawless. Minor elevation in "delicate moment" slightly clashes with POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock tinkerer + pattern theory avoids trope reliance; vault's sand-table rehearsal space transforms treasure-hunt conventions. Emotional specificity in "child's sketch spelling 'Again'" grounds abstraction. Risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
