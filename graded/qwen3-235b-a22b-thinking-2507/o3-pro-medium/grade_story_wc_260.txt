<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Calder’s trembling hands amid empty workspace and admission "I wanted admiration more than truth." Embodied cost when pressing gasps/disappointment "against his ribs, letting it sting" avoids therapy-speak while showing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via Calder’s stitched chest hole and "fragile convictions rebuilt" under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in "letting it sting, letting it instruct" during the gasp/disappointment beat, narrowing options toward truth without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brazier’s smoke becomes a "benediction" charging the final image, while the workshop’s liminal space ("halfway between village and wilderness") actively constrains Calder’s truth-reconstruction. Tool specificity—bone knife trimming deceit—directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively through Calder’s ritual: trimming adjectives, sewing pauses, and admitting flaw narrow options toward truth. Cost crystallizes when "the hole in his chest felt partially stitched" after confronting his motive, driving the final walk toward village verdict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Calder’s chameleon adaptation metaphor—truth as "slowly, honestly, visibly" changing hue—not moralizing. Final image ("fragile convictions rebuilt in shimmering stillness") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "taste of ink to the rafters" and "dawn crept like diluted wine." Rhythmic control under pressure: short, incisive sentences during trimming ("Smoke coiled upward...") contrast with flowing reflection, all anchored to Calder’s wildlife-handler lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances story or atmosphere. "Smoke drifted through missing roof boards like a benediction" distills closure with crystalline specificity. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle—admission scene’s raw simplicity ("I wanted admiration...") heightens pressure without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through concrete stakes: dyes hidden "beneath the cart" and chameleon tail as shed layer. Emotional specificity in children’s "gasps" turning to "disappointment" avoids generic templates, while the risk of truthful demonstrations ("laughter heard while standing tall") heightens coherence.</comment>
