<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Queen's sovereignty/guilt contradiction manifests in embodied choices (kneeling crown-jangling abdication); Riall's silent loyalty shift reveals relationship crucible without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands via abdication offer reversing starlight drip; causal lens holds as dream-driven ascent forces confrontation with past lie, cost legible in "crown jangling against stone".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto constrains climax: thin air and organ-pipe stalactites shape the queen's kneeling confession, charging final image of "wounded stars" mending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dreams to sovereignty as queen's agency (entering grotto) triggers memory revelation, narrowing choice to abdication with reign as undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through starlight's transformation from bleeding to mending; final image of "slow mending" reweights guilt without moralizing, preserving complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("gaps where stars seemed wounded") and rhythmic control under pressure; minimal dialogue avoids convergence, though Riall's voice lacks distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lacy menace" repetition functions as motif not scaffold; final line's "wounded stars" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guilt-as-physical-wound via bleeding starlight; abdication as healing reconfigures usurpation trope through specific cobalt grotto mechanics.</comment>
