<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shines through plant telepathy ("moss hummed suggestions") and embodied conflict between revolutionary fervor and "grandmotherly caution," but micro-struggle during the cocoon unsealing lacks visible contradictory impulses at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: crews' hammers ringing "in a new cadence" crystallizes the cost of mishandling destiny, with the mineral-thirsty water and sulfur veins making conceptual risk palpable under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs actively constrain choices—the scalding pool forces the tamarisk raft innovation, while steam's activation of the kite script directly enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation hinges on Liora's agency: realizing the kite is the key drives the pivotal pledge, with the conceptual cost of "belonging to no throne" reweighting the dominant stake through her voluntary renunciation of dynastic control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "seedling vs. statue" motif, culminating in the hammers' new cadence—a resonant, non-literal answer to "evolving tradition" that avoids moralizing while reweighting the cocoon's sulfur veins as fragile hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aloe clusters told her") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control ("steam turning her silver hair into a comet's tail"), though "chlorophyll-scented vapor" slightly drifts from Liora's lexicon during high-stakes unsealing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "mineral thirst" creates a subtle metaphor tension in the hot springs beat, but propulsion remains impeccable with no closure-dulling artifacts, narrowly missing Q7's 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through the "rebel kindly" philosophy and symbiotic embryo, with risk-taking heightening stakes via the fragile pledge—though the tamarisk raft solution edges toward convenient within-band adjustment.</comment>
