<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "Mara burns bridges carefully" vs. Declin's unresolved promise; embodied emotion via scar-linking and rib-caged memory. Final renunciation (walking toward next wound) earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "silence that now knew how to breathe" reweights grief through Declin's departure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—breath attempts narrow options toward irrevocable release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary constrains every choice (kneeling on cracked stones, wind-tapped knocker); bronze ring charges the final image as "improbable mouth." Micro-setting (soot, scars) directly shapes tactics and closure's "lungcraft" revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through breath attempts—each fracture healing "a syllable"—until Declin's sphere floats. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in "brittle" mist shattering before earned wholeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "linking through scars," not moralizing. Final image ("soot itself had learned lungcraft") resonates as non-literal answer to suffocation, reweighting grief without stated moral. Avoids thematic echo flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "soot like constellations," "bruised memories." Rhythmic control peaks in breath sequences—"mist held, forming a small sphere." Elision (Declin's death) taught early and paid in visceral attempts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("grief came wearing gentler names"). Minor overwriting in "dusting them with gloved tenderness" risks density but doesn't dull closure's river-current payoff. No cadence breaks in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "shadow keeper" specificity and lungcraft metaphor. Fresh synthesis: teaching breath to drowned boy as scar-linking ritual. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
