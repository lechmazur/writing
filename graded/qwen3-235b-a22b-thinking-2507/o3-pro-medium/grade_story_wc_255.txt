<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's colorblindness drives sensory compensation ("taste temperature," "feel amber shading"), making flaws active stakes. Contradictory impulses (proving beauty vs. enforced silence) crystallize in micro-choices like ash-rearranged gratitude. Goran's arc from skepticism to bowed humility shows earned cost without over-tidying. Slight thinness in Lio's pre-scene motivation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Goran's bowed head and "humility awakening" reconfigure the dominant stake (perfection vs. imperfection) with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density ("frozen bursts where air escaped") that reweights meaning. Cost proof undeniable in "perfect orbs had never danced with such living light."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Furnace heat directly pressures glassblowing choices; ash becomes pigment for gratitude. Concertina reed (tool) enables the pivotal lopsided tear. Final prismatic embers charge closure by reweighting "broken eyes find perfect dawn." Micro-setting constraints (brick ledge for coded flowers) shape every interaction decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (beauty in imperfection) signaled immediately via "wilted violets better than flawless roses." Escalation through protagonist agency: Goran's shard addition actively deepens the fusion, narrowing options toward shared breath. Cost crystallized in his "shoulders dropped like cooling slag"—a visible price that reconfigures his artistry under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "beauty hides where symmetry fails" proven by glass fractures scattering "wild spectra." Final image ("broken eyes can find perfect dawn") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in concrete particulars (ash, crooked thistles), rejecting balanced toggles for Goran's flawed perfectionism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV-permeated texture: "colors flashed against his gray vision" embodies Lio's perception. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("smoke curled into pale sky") to staccato breaths during glassblowing. Zero head-hopping; sensory selectivity ("almost fragrant weed nobody named") reflects painter's priorities. Pressure modulates voice without loss of coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmered like smoke trapped in amber" achieves triple duty (image/theme/character). Propulsion through kinetic verbs ("spun," "cupped," "scattering") avoids overwriting. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle. Metaphors stay coherent ("crack lets more music out of a bell" prefigures glass fractures).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: colorblind painter redefining beauty through non-visual senses. Risk-taking in silent plant communication feels inevitable, not gimmicky. "Innocently cunning" reframed as strategic sensory adaptation. Emotional truth anchors freshness—"wilted violets" reject rose clichés while charging stakes organically.</comment>
