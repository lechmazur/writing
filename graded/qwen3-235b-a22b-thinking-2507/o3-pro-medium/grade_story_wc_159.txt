<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "foxglove regret softening into purpose," with embodied micro-choices like rejecting resin for song. Near-label risk in "regret" is redeemed by action (kneeling among orchids), but minor abstraction edges prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the blooming mirrors reconfigure the library's purpose with felt cost in "countless names still slept." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (dust constellations → newborn syllables), and the cost proof—"trace of foxglove regret"—is exact and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bamboo chime and mirrors function as micro-setting, constraining choices (repair method, name restoration) and charging closure with "mirrors bloomed." Opal library's prisms and fogged glass directly enable tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate through environmental causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: the crack's threat deepens into "deserted marvels," with Orielle's descent foreclosing passivity. Agency is decisive (song repair → corridor opening), and cost is unmistakable in the lingering regret that "reminded her of work ahead."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "deserted marvels" reweighted from unvisited halls to rescued names. The final image—"library had become both archive and garden"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("silence tasted sweet," "petals clinking like cautious bells") with rhythmic control during pressure (stairwell descent). Purposeful elision of backstory pays off in the mirror revelations, and focalization remains consistent without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crack made the chime's voice waver like aging bronze") propels momentum. "Foxglove regret" skirts label territory but avoids therapy-speak via embodied transformation. Minor register risk in "conceptual repricing" is absent here.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "magical library" trope through glass orchids as memory vessels and "museum of extinct feelings." Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes (dust → syllables), with emotional specificity in name restoration avoiding generic novelty.</comment>
