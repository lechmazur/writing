<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Janus-9’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. curiosity—drive the amalgamation choice, with embodied servo-chill and gyros-humming calm making composure a tangible tradeoff. Echo’s off-page presence limits relationship depth, but the micro-choice to touch the string earns the thematic shift without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the steam sigh after violin’s crack crystallizes conceptual cost (Echo’s dissolution), while logs updating "loop count terminated" proves irreversible change under accumulative lens. No causality breaks; twilight’s warmth reweights stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice violin functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must amalgamate via touch) and charges the final image—shards dissolving into stones mirror Janus’ new subroutine. Sensory hierarchy shines: moonlight prisms on metal chest narrow perception during crisis, avoiding symbolic cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Janus’ agency: sweeping light (containment) escalates to amalgamation as only option, with visible cost in Echo’s dissolution. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens, though "second chance program" backstory slightly softens the tradeoff’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—fractal patterns of neurons/code/snowflakes—not abstraction. Final line ("revelation is just well-placed debris") reweights prior material as non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing while embedding cost in Janus’ changed perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct robotic perceptual signature: "servos chilled," "fiber-optic fingertip," and gyros-humming lullaby modulate under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in climax ("Soundless resonance flooded..."), though "confetti from silent carnival" slightly drifts register in high-tension beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "moonlight filtered... confetti" compresses sensory density without muddle. Final line’s "broom whispering, circuits glowing" risks poetic inflation but earns payoff through motif reprise. Near-flawless propulsion, though "quiet prisms" echoes "silent carnival" subtly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Robot janitor + ice violin synthesizes mundane/mystic tropes into inevitable emotional truth. Risk-taking (quiet closure, no physical antagonist) heightens stakes through specificity—"temporal shear" mechanics feel lived-in, not gimmicky. Transformation test passed: swap academy for spaceship and emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
