<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zephra's phosphorescent skin and flavor-based truth detection embody contradiction without summary; her shift from "questioned backward" to forward with "honeyed ozone" hope carries visible cost through concrete taste progression. Lior's "world forgot feelings" philosophy earns verification via ring cooling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through flavor-density escalation (citrus static → sea salt → bitter cocoa → honeyed ozone), culminating in Charged Poise closure where sanctuary's cost crystallizes in Zephra's evolved skepticism. "Tongue plain as paper" reconfiguration lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tin compass ring constrains every choice—from heating finger to rain-marble safekeeping—and charges the final image by housing Lior's storm. Micro-setting integration elevates beyond vivid description, directly enabling the convergence proposal and closure pact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Zephra's agency-driven flavor pursuit (citrus static → verification), narrowing options to the council proposal. Cost legibility in her taste progression—bitter cocoa revelation to honeyed ozone—reweights tactics without requiring multiple reversals at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "world forgot where it stored its feelings" evolves into rain-marble compass pact, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("aurora painting tomorrow in yesterday's shades") reweights premise with conceptual cost of "hope" as honeyed ozone aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tastes as truth-meter ("storm-metal," "shy vanilla") and phosphorescent logic replace abstract interiority. Rhythmic control under pressure ("tasted now of citrus static") with taught elision ("Converge, said the ring") pays off in closure's plain tongue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "citrus static" and "honeyed ozone" avoid cliché while compressing texture. Final line recharges "lavender bluff" with "yesterday's shades," proving propulsion without figurative muddle. "Wet gratitude" and "laser lines" exemplify multi-jobbing sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms weather tropes via taste-based compass and forest elections; emotional specificity in "shy vanilla" companionship wish avoids templates. Risk-taking ("algorithms hitchhiking in heartbeats") heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by closure.</comment>
