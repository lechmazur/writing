<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("weight of withheld truth") intensifies organically through embodied contradictions: curiosity vs. obedience crystallized in "weighed obedience against curiosity." Final renunciation ("map not roads but lacunae") is earned by prior causality—the sister's warning and his realization that "maps were never neutral." No therapy-speak; flaws (reckless wanderer) compound visibly when he chooses concealment over discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Kael renounces discovery with visible cost ("tame future cycles"). Causal links hold: shard synchronization enables sister's warning, driving his redirection. "Maps were never neutral" crystallizes the trade-off. Cost proof: "gravity of her confession, heavier than lead, yet edged with sweetness" reconfigures truth as burden/freedom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The green shard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its "lullaby wavelengths" guide the drone interaction, and pocketing it ("resolved to map lacunae") reweights its meaning from discovery tool to protective burden. Repair bay's "cracked workbench" and "latent melody" constrain choices—grease/dust anchor Kael's return, making the final image resonate with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: sister's revelation transforms "withheld truth" from information to active burden ("anchor reckless wanderers"), forcing Kael's trade-off (curiosity vs. obedience). Escalation is driven solely by his agency—redirecting pathways to conceal the gate—foreclosing discovery with felt cost ("cycle coiling... promising urges he would have to tame"). Fleet threat remains viscerally present via "triangulate our resonance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "redirect the map" evolves from garbled plea to tactical instruction, culminating in "map lacunae, the safe blanks where tyrants lose direction." No moralizing; the final image reweights truth as protective absence without stating a moral. Conceptual cost (freedom's weight) is undeniable through sensory language ("heavier than lead, yet edged with sweetness").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael's synesthesia ("tasted brine," "flavor of gravity") modulates under pressure—lyrical during tunnel-weaving, sparse at climax. Rhythmic control shines in closure ("dawn crept... but inside he remained half-asleep"), recharging "murmur of dreams" with earned cost. Elision (sister's hologram) is taught early via shard's "lullabies" and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through layered syntax: "ribbons of smell, sound, pressure, and aftertaste" compresses transition while advancing plot. Figurative language precise ("worlds recoiled like taut cords") with no muddle in peak beats. Final line ("working in the murmur... once more") recharges opening motif with cost, avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "sensory map maker" reimagines cartography as embodied craft ("weave between worlds like helix of perfume"). Risk-taking (synesthesia as navigation) heightens stakes without gimmickry—final reconfiguration ("map lacunae") feels inevitable through prior particulars. Avoids abstraction; "tyrants lose direction" grounds universality in tactile specificity.</comment>
