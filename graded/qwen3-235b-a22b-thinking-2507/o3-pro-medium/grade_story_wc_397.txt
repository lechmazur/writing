<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("gripped reality loosely, as if every surface coated in melting sleet") but euthanasia motivation remains slightly distant despite strong embodied trauma; final renunciation of urgency earns closure with felt cost in "postponed departure".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "marina itself was speaking" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost in "postponed departure"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ice-syllable accumulation to final breath-harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice functions as active constraint: ice calves' "throaty crack" forces Mara's epiphany; parasol tip's wind-whistle directly charges final image where "syllables harmonized with her breath".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings' sound) tightens via blizzard trapping crew; cost legible in "postponed departure" but pressure escalation slightly soft—environment drives more than agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through ice dialects and parasol whistles; final image ("horizon lowers its lantern") offers non-literal answer to "sound of endings" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("wind scud through its tiny holes"); rhythmic control under blizzard pressure flawless; no POV leakage despite lyrical compression; "tectonic lullaby" modulates voice perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle crack of moving ice" shows/textures simultaneously; minor density risk in "breathing hush between clinks" but payoff in closure image justifies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism via ice-syllable metaphor; specific detail ("child's red boot" salvage) creates freshness; avoids safety-middle by making endings plural rather than singular.</comment>
