<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("yank behind sternum"), but Olivine's micro-choices under pressure lack sufficient contradiction; the self-confrontation climax feels earned yet her prior flaw ("patterns empty") isn't tested in earlier decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: snowmelt's final whisper reweights "ice can be woven anew" with undeniable conceptual cost, while the Accumulative/Textural lens (weight-collection pattern) holds coherently from first droplet to braided tapestry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp constrains every choice—from flame orientation to revealing the pit—and charges the final image ("well-behaved ember"), transforming tool into micro-setting that actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Olivine's agency (rotating flame, spinning filaments), but the shepherd/bride vignettes feel like checklist burdens; pressure tightens meaningfully only when her own 12-dram burden crystallizes the cost of avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "weights" motif, culminating in the resonant final line where snowmelt whispers burdens can be "woven anew"—a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of crushed ice," flame as "eager surveyor") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shines in the calcification sequence where syntax compresses with Olivine's paralysis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion, but "whalebone reverie" and "infinite coastlines" verge on ornamental; one paraphrase loop ("boundary-lessly trapped" repeated without escalation) slightly dulls the mid-scene momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "emotional burden" tropes through precise drams measurement and bronze-grotto physics; the snowmelt's final whisper reconfigures the core premise with inevitable freshness that avoids abstraction.</comment>
