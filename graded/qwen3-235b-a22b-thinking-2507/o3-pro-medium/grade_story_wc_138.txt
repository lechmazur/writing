<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Callix’s ennui-thirst duality, but "dimensionally aware" lacks visible tradeoffs beyond sensing mutiny. Final choice to hunt shards earns closure through prior causality, though the trait’s impact stays underexploited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost: boredom reframed as refusal to "intrigue oneself." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the solar storm’s escalation tightens tactics via coil asymmetry, making the whisper’s "coordinate" revelation undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains choices (light-bending demands precise coil placement) and charges closure’s "rephrased" imagery. Body/tool integration is masterful: storing the shard in Callix’s ribcage becomes the only "prison I trusted," shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Callix’s agency: solar storm pressure forces coil adjustments that trigger mutiny. Cost legibility stumbles slightly—spatial mutiny’s rules feel under-defined during the seam crisis, muddying the tradeoff between stepping through or stabilizing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the shard’s "coordinate" whisper reweights goodbye without moralizing. Final image ("walked toward goodbye with genuine thirst") embodies earned wisdom through prior particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dyed glass surrendering to dusk") sustains under pressure. Rhythmic control excels in mutiny’s chaos ("Static sizzled against my skin"), though "dimensionally aware" momentarily drifts into clinical diction against immortal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion thrives in lines like "thunder finished its own echo and rested." Minor deduction: "leaded silk" feels overly precise without contextual weight, slightly diluting closure’s ribcage motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of physics and grief—spatial mutiny as metaphor for farewell—feels inevitable. Risk-taking (dense lyricism) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "dimensionally aware" lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
