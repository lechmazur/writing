<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "no saboteur, only a historian who preferred chemistry over shouts" and sensorial sorrow questioning archives. Minor abstraction in "catalogued details even her lens missed" slightly dilutes embodied emotion at peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "photographing not just the last plume but the valley's last unmanufactured morning," making conceptual cost undeniable. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) nearly breaches 9.0 but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cracked vial constrains choice (socket placement) and charges final image with "silence of the nightwatch's grain." Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere; "dragon-scale shadows" concretely shapes plume observation tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Halina's agency (flare programming), but eruption timing feels externally driven rather than causally linked to her actions. Cost ("bureaucracy erased context") legible yet escalation lacks full protagonist-driven pressure per Accumulative lens demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "dawnlit melancholy" into "frost that refuses to melt indoors" as non-literal answer to archival doubt. Zero thematic echo; "sensorial sorrow" emerges from concrete particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "mineral smell, static on tongue" under stress. Rhythmic shift from technical notes to lullaby cadence in commentary demonstrates mastery of pressure modulation without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or artifacts; "crystals glittered inside the vapor, catching starlight" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s cadence ("silence... and the mountain's goodbye") achieves crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "last stand" trope through historian's quiet chemistry-based resistance. Emotional specificity in "doubt[ing]" archives conveys sensorial sorrow avoids generic templates, though risk-taking stops short of radical structural innovation.</comment>
