<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kestrel’s "futuristic nostalgia" and final renunciation; flaws (over-idealism) compound her choice. No therapy-speak, but Palim’s emoji feels slightly flat for secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: throne’s meaning reweights via staircase seeds with felt cost (sacrificed ascension). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through "paint remembers" payoff, though sigil choice lacks micro-tension escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall paint layers constrain choice (solvent sprayer use) and charge closure; orchard air’s "apple, cedar, ozone" specificity embodies theme. "Shattered solar panels like ancient stained glass" perfectly filters history through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully via sigil choice (claim throne vs. gift possibility), with visible cost in Kestrel’s ascent refusal. Agency-driven escalation strong, but "oppressive silence" moment lacks tangible pressure escalation before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "crowns were questions" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image ("every droplet carries a reflection") reweights throne as communal possibility. Slight thematic echo risk in "gift possibility" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "phosphor mist like digital snow" filters tech through poetic lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (e.g., staccato "She unsheathed... misted... pressed"). No head-hopping; Palim’s beeps feel character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "kaleidoscopic waterfall" to "droplet reflections" shows purposeful recurrence. Minor overwriting: "buffet of holo-memories" feels forced. Final line’s rhythm elevates closure without muddling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "throne" as unclaimed communal path avoids trope. Orchid/stairway reconfiguration feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, e.g., "past and future kiss" charges emotional truth.</comment>
