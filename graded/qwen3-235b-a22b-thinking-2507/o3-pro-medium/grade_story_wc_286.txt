<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("exhaled dust instead of doubt") and micro-choices (rotating lantern fractionally) reveal character, but interior contradiction remains underdeveloped; Rua's "zen-minded" nature lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal timeline alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with braided shadows mapping resilience, but "kindness is the only light" constitutes thematic echo in final beats, risking Q5 penalty without undermining the earned cost of marble grains from vanished nectar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the lantern glass constrains choices (pressing shard into clay) and charges the final image ("kiln of moments warmed beneath the growing sun"), while "peg-legged mesquite" and "chimney smoke" function as active environmental pressures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when timelines crack and Rua presses the shard, with visible cost in marble grains proving time misfiring; agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens through sun-pattern rotations that narrow options toward the cup-making climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Kindness is the only light" triggers thematic echo penalty in final paragraph, nearly negating the resonant non-literal answer where bees of light taste clay rims; otherwise, the cups for returning bees offer earned subtextual resolution to resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phototropic to kindness," "scalpel wings") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("kiln cracked open like sunrise over clay") pays off cleanly in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "warm nectar drip from a future already abolished by heat" does triple duty advancing time, emotion, and theme; final line recharges "kiln" motif with crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms desert wasteland trope through specific verifiable details (marble grains from nectar, chimney smoke as temporal marker); risk-taking with fractured timelines feels inevitable in hindsight when bees of light validate the cup-making.</comment>
