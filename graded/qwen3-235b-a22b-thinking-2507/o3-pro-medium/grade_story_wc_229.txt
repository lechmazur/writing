<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Milo's motivation is serene but untested by internal struggle. Final endurance (recording "unshouting faith") lacks embodied cost—Bram's tears externalize the emotional weight instead of revealing Milo's personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the windbell's premature ring reconfigures "intentions travel farther" with conceptual cost ("evidence cannot be unmade"). But escalation lacks mid-scene tightening—pressure accumulates linearly without narrowing options before the test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: jasmine scent guides the gull's flight, directly shaping the experiment's outcome. Final image ("curling around the world like sunrise on water") charges the closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (proving whispers > shouts) escalate through accumulated ritual (weeks of whispering into vial), but no on-page choice narrows options—the foghorn blast is part of the plan, not a complication. Cost is legible ("evidence cannot be unmade") yet feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the empty vial and vibrating cork embody "kindness measured against distance." Final line avoids moralizing by reweighting the premise via physical motion ("curling like sunrise on water"), achieving resonant subtext without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Milo notices vibrations and scents as tactical tools ("air hummed with promise"). But rhythmic control falters under peak pressure—releasing the whisper uses lyrical diction ("breathed into nothing") inconsistent with an assistant keeper's lexicon during critical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No prose loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm purposefully. However, "screaming tenderness" borders on therapy-speak in a high-stakes beat, and "vibrations of intent gaining frequency" uses elevated diction that clashes with the POV's occupational voice during the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lighthouse tropes: jasmine scent as "secret telegraph" and driftwood cork purifying intentions feel specific to Milo's worldview. Risk-taking (testing metaphysical concepts via windbell) heightens stakes without gimmickry, following implications to resonant closure.</comment>
