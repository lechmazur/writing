<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserving both hope/wisdom) drive Jalen's compromise; embodied cost in sweat/starlight constellations and frayed rope. "Texture is felt, not archived" avoids diagnostic labels while crystallizing motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the new ridge pulses with "twin heartbeats" after Jalen's weaving, with cost legible in rope's fraying and time's rearrangement ("first light tinged... though night should still have reigned"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto actively constrains choice: ridges become "thin pages" Jalen deciphers, and the final smoother ridge physically manifests his compromise. Sweat/starlight "accidental constellations" between knees charge the cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when Jalen must choose between villagers' hope or wisdom; escalation via his agency ("fingertips dance across the rope") deepens pressure until the crossroad vision forces trade-off. Cost unmistakable in rope's shortening and altered dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the woven grooves and pulsing ridge offer resonant answer to "texture of time" without moralizing. Final image ("stories keep unraveling") reweights prior material through the grotto's glow as "punctuation mark".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: poet notices "crickets' twilight orchestra" and rope as "unfinished question mark". Rhythm modulates under pressure—short phrases during vision ("Sweat trickled...") versus lyrical flow elsewhere—without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels story: "rope dangled like an unfinished question mark" establishes mystery while "accidental constellations" embodies cost. Final line recharges rope motif with "gorgeously frayed perimeter" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via tactile specificity: energy beings as "goosebumps," compromise as "faint yet durable grooves." Risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off—quiet resolution avoids symmetry while "ethically playful" drives method.</comment>
