<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kerrin’s obedient brooding versus desperate memory quest; scarab birthmark revelation earns closure through embodied micro-choice (prying lid), but infant merging lacks sufficient struggle to feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis—Kerrin’s restored memories charge her resolve to heal Tideford—but whale’s mid-scene vanishing creates minor orientation debt that slightly muddles causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unlit lantern and salt crystals constrain choices (coffee ritual, coffin exhumation) and charge final image; "gleaming silence" evolves from atmospheric detail to thematic heartbeat through tactile specificity like chiming crystals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through gravity pockets' physical constraints (steam sliding sideways), but escalation relies too heavily on coffee grounds' "insistence" rather than Kerrin’s active decisions under pressure at critical moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt crystals caging memories: final image of lanterns mirroring crystal glow offers resonant answer to "where deleted memories go" without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality via concrete cost (tears dissolving salt paths).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("wicks without striking sparks," gravity-tugged steam), but late POV slippage into collective townsfolk ("fishermen gathered") slightly dilutes singular focalization without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density ("petals locked yet scentless"), though "crystals wailed in frequencies below sound" risks overwriting; no loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor ("sodium stars") barely obscures closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory-loss trope through gravity pockets and salt coffins; "pockets of gravity waiting in patient accord" synthesizes physics and emotion ingeniously, though whale vanishing lacks sufficient groundwork for total inevitability.</comment>
