<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ila's trembling gloves versus decisive transmission; embodied conflict ("breath fogged then vanished within the blink") avoids therapy-speak. Malvek's late arrival lacks sufficient prior pressure to deepen relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "We hear you, and the world shifts" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (ice groaning). Accumulative lens holds—pressure intensifies through sensory density, not causal turns, per short-form allowances.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains every choice: frozen pane reflects Ila's decision, comms crypt's permafrost impedes access. Final image ("library seemed to breathe back") recharges the opening's "dizzying quiet" with irreversible tonal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety) tightens via Ila's transmission—a single agency-driven deepening under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: "feeling lighter and more endangered," with Malvek's arrival proving consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "contraband truths" reweight via weather buoy transmission. Final image ("world shifts") offers non-literal answer to censorship question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "ink blossoming into voices" filters reality through archivist's lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("She slipped to the comms crypt...") modulates with tension, no head-hopping despite dual-character ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "auditors discovering the ashes of something else" slightly paraphrases prior stakes. Minor scaffold in climax ("She slipped... Terminals... Green text...") costs 0.4 without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through cryogenic specificity—weather buoys as truth conduits feel inevitable. Emotional truth in "ice inside him groan like spring rivers" avoids generic rebellion narratives.</comment>
