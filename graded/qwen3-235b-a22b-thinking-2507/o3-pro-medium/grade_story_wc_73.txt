<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marlen's interior contradiction—daring yet frozen by regret—drives every choice; his embodied emotion (tears as equations) avoids labels while the chipped die's backstory earns the final stillness with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the "landing wide enough to stand beside regret" crystallizes options with conceptual cost, under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (rain on bakery bricks) reweights regret's weight without causal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as micro-setting—gravity's loss and shuddering treads directly constrain choices; the chipped die's scarlet six charges the final image when "the dim light and looked healed," fulfilling 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Marlen's agency: the shift from demanding reversal to accepting texture ("Could a number reveal feel?") narrows options under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in his weeping and the erased sums' "numbers lost voice."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—the dice roll revealing "warmth of her hand withdrawing" reweights regret without moralizing; the final "silence between probabilities" offers resonant, non-literal closure to the central question of time and loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds moved under us like discarded thoughts") persists under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in the dice roll's "rattling doors in a windstorm," with patterned elision (time dilation) taught early and paid off in closure's stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dice clicking like nervous beetles") advances character and atmosphere, with figurative language ("tears were equations") clarifying emotional stakes without muddle in the pivotal closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms infinite staircase trope through statistical obsession and regret's texture; specific details (chipped die's scarlet six, rain on bakery bricks) synthesize into inevitable emotional truth, avoiding abstraction while risking conceptual closure.</comment>
