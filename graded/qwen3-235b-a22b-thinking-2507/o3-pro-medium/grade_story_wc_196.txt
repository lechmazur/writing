<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "tactfully hopeful" stance masking personal history; embodied emotion in tracing dust patterns avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to deliver button earns closure through prior causality, though Jordan's abrupt shift to "maybe enlist" lacks layered irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns escalate pressure toward Charged Poise closure where shadows "lengthened, tactfully hopeful" crystallize cost of connection. Orientation anchors at 78 words; no causality breaks, but micro-turns lack one felt cost escalation before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (tracing guides search) and charges final image ("accumulated dust patterns on streetlights"). Tool (button) maps trenches onto palm while file room’s "anxious paper" smell shapes Mara’s tactile decisions throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnifying kindnesses) tightens through Mara’s agency: dust discovery → defying procedure → delivery. Cost legible in "skepticism" to "strange stillness" shift, but Jordan’s emotional progression lacks visible price paid (e.g., no hesitation touching button).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button’s physical weight becoming "ballast rather than burden"; final image reweights "examined unknown" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "kindness would shrink instead of magnify" slightly over-articulates the core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "dust resembled footprints, river deltas"; rhythmic control in "exhaled the dust, began translating aloud." No head-hopping; stress compresses syntax ("pulse kicked like runaway stamp") without breaking voice. Jordan’s dialogue carries authentic subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "brittle file" and "rainclouds muttering" achieve high density. Minor scaffold in "shapes in powder... suggested unknown direction" slightly dulls momentum, but no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s "examined unknown" charges closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic dust as historical conduit transforms foster-care trope. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens pays off through tactile specificity ("metal disc map trenches"). Avoids abstraction via "gray cotton drop cloth" rituals; no derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
