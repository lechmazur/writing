<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through scarf ritual and hyperbolic mapping; "sanely eccentric" manifests in chalk-drawing compulsion under patron pressure. Final bow earned by prior causality, but micro-contradictions (desire to seize stories vs. need to nurture silence) lack layered embodiment in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "We will come when you learn to shelve silence" crystallizes the quest’s reconfiguration. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density peaks as analog memories pool along geodesics—but physical cost of "tilt[ing] courteously aside" remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library micro-setting constrains choices: patrons force invisibility, bioluminescent footnotes charge the corridor discovery. Scarf’s "analog memories" evolve from grandmother’s relic to map-making tool, directly shaping the final image of reawakened stories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patrons’ arrival tightens stakes by forcing ritual interruption; Hollis’ agency in resuming the chalk disk deepens the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual (redefining "shelving" as nurturing silence), but physical consequence of entering the corridor lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "observed solitude" as creation’s climate, not stated morality. Final image—"stories breathed, newly reawakened, knowing where they might live"—resonantly answers the central question by reweighting Hollis’ entire quest without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sanely eccentric" lens filters details like "perforated pages" and "origami verbs." Rhythmic control shines in hyperbolic geometry sequence, though "air itself was narrative potential" slightly drifts from embodied POV during corridor entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chalk dust like snowfall in old photographs" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "fragrance of paper pulp and possibility" slightly muddles peak-beat clarity, but closure propulsion remains impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through hyperbolic geometry and "analog memories," avoiding quirkiness. "Shelve silence" reframing feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (math as magic system) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
