<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vision hurt, yet he welcomed the ache," with embodied emotion avoiding therapy-speak; closure choice (leaving the Tear) earned through breathing micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "sparks settled among wisteria" visibly reweights stakes under Accumulative lens; lens clarity and cost legibility ("each regret left his body as a spark") flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct constrains choices (breathing alters sight) and charges final image ("arches no longer resembled bones but open arms"); tool (camera obscura) directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (petals → sparks → memories) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable as regrets transform into constellations, altering Lysander's stance with visible trade-off (pain for revelation).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "unused love seeds the dusk," avoiding moralizing; final image ("arches as open arms") resonantly answers central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lenses stained with silver nitrate," breathing altering sight) with rhythmic control; elision of past life taught early and paid off in monk-revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold in "he hoped the resulting image would point toward the hidden vault" slightly bloats momentum; zero loops yet figurative density risks muddling in "half-remembered ribs" opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unused love as "seeds the dusk" transforms trope through camera obscura mechanics; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional truth.</comment>
