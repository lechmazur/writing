<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ridiculous yet resolute" under pressure; embodied awe/trust during descent earns closure. Micro-choices (tracing vapor, reading phrasebook) reveal cartographic values with cost, though internal conflict remains observational until the pivotal step onto ice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ascending with "river’s first syllable" crystallizes the shift from printed to oral atlas with conceptual cost (pen bleeding into air). Accumulative lens holds through vapor-to-ice pattern escalation, though the "older than weather" line slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and condensation patterns actively constrain choices (tracing vapor guides descent) and charge the final image (outpost shedding corrosion). Micro-setting mastery: breath vapor as hydrological map directly enables the pivotal discovery beneath the buoy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: tracing vapor → ice crack → descent. The tangible cost (printed atlases invalidated, pen bleeding harmlessly) forecloses Morrow’s cartographic path while deepening the central question. "Water remembers" ritual drives escalation with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: condensation patterns reconfigure into river systems, phrasebook ritual becomes atlas foundation. Final image ("shed corrosion like old bark") resonates as non-literal answer to "where rivers begin" without moralizing, embracing memory’s fluid authority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters world through cartographer’s precision ("calipers, skepticism") and linguist’s polyphony. Perceptual signature shines in "condensation sketching places no ink dared"; rhythmic control peaks during phrasebook reading where syntax fractures with snowfall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "breath clouding glass like converging tributaries" doing triple duty. Final image "shed corrosion like old bark" earns textural charge without muddle, though "radiant as lightning paused midflash" risks slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms atlas trope through hydrology/linguistics synthesis: rivers beginning in vapor, atlases as spoken memory. Fresh inflection in "condensation as hydrological map" feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
