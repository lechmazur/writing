<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s embodied contradiction ("gravel-edged voice/tender words") and micro-choices (offering porcelain shard) earn the shift from "bargained innocence" to "new stewardship." Juniper’s fury-to-quiet transition feels authentic through physicality ("knees to chin"), though the epiphany edges toward tidiness without sufficient struggle in the shard moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "scars cool... whispering translation had begun" crystallizes the cost of shared burden with undeniable conceptual weight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the celestial motif’s density reweights stakes without causal breaks, and the footstep interruption tightens pressure organically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The porcelain box functions as essential micro-setting: it constrains choices (offering the shard) and charges the final image ("pressed against her heart to remember possibility"). Ridge path actively shapes ritual ("accepted partial custody of burdens"), avoiding postcard passivity through tactile integration like "needles that smelled of memory."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively when Juniper’s arrival forces Rowan to shift from solitary ritual to shared translation. His agency in redefining "bargained innocence" as "negotiated stewardship" forecloses isolation with felt cost ("burdens" redistributed), though the pressure escalation lacks one more visible trade-off before the shard moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "ash is the first draft" and the porcelain’s dual nature avoid moralizing. The final image reweights "hard softness" as active resilience ("duet... moving into unburned dark"), offering a resonant, non-literal answer to translating pain without a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via character-specific noticing ("planets circling their star-beloved courses"; "charcoal scent"). Rhythmic control under pressure—sentence compression during ritual ("inhaled... exhaled deliberately")—heightens tension without sacrificing clarity or voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moonlight slid inside, pooling over ashes like milk over ink" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline abstraction ("something smaller than regret") slightly muddles the ritual beat but is quickly grounded by physical action, avoiding closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter tropes through "bargained innocence" as active philosophy, not trauma cliché. "Hard softness" as embodied duality (not just description) and celestial choreography of "small acts of courage" synthesize fresh emotional logic that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
