<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied contradiction (seeking closure through reopening wounds) but "diagnostic label-speak" in "paradox she understood only in whispering fragments" undermines authenticity. Final choice earned though cost escalation feels thin despite blood loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (closure as retelling) with visceral cost (blood, pain), but two distinct non-closure issues: plant telepathy convenience and meteor hush coincidence. Orientation test passed cleanly with "quiet tower at dawn" anchoring by word 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Body (scar tissue), tool (hourglass), and object (coffee rings) all constrain choices and charge the final image. "Pale crescent" closure reweights setting details organically. Micro-setting excellence with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transferring miracle) lacks meaningful escalation—no opposition beyond self-inflicted pain. Single tightening (tunneling sutures) sufficient for length but fails to foreclose options with visible trade-offs; stakes remain abstract despite visceral pain descriptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar narratives and coffee rings without moralizing. Final image reweights "silence" into "retelling" perfectly. Capped at 8.8 due to Q4's weak escalation preventing higher thematic resonance despite flawless execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pain arrived slowly, like a polite guest removing snow") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Meteor hush" description slightly overwrought but taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates beautifully with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "chlorophyll riddles" feels forced poetic diction and "smelted comets" creates minor metaphor clash. Zero loops or scaffold; coffee ring density drives momentum without muddling closure. Final image crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms medical tropes through unique scar-narrative lens. Telepathic plants deeply integrated (ivy guides exact location), not gimmicky. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
