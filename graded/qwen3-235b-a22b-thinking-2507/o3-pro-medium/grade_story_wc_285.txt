<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the coachman’s release of the child memory versus his vow to wait; micro-choices like threading the silver hair reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No therapy-speak, but the woman’s "unknot our history" slightly edges toward abstraction without sufficient embodied struggle in her single line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly when rain gutters cease ticking, crystallizing the cost of distillation with undeniable pressure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, and the persistent constraint of the timetable’s boundary shapes every tactical choice toward this resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The river crossing functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (waiting in fog) and charges the final image—ripples reconfiguring the fog into "a giant tree showing age in motion." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, with tactile details like the yarn needle’s "gleam as a compass" deepening the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the coachman’s agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening through the woman’s arrival and the needle ritual. The cost—rain gutters ceasing—is visible and legible, but the dominant stake ("distill complexity") could deepen earlier; the woman’s "tangled history" line feels slightly abstract for peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the palimpsest metaphor and distillation ritual, avoiding moralizing. The final image of braided silver-gold hair reweights prior material as a non-literal answer to "burden to becoming," but the phrase "distill complexity into essence" risks slight thematic echo without enough concrete friction in the setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "spindrift serenity" and "drip that fell from the ironwork" creates rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift occurs with "percolated" in high-stakes moments, but the voice modulation from tense waiting to luminous silence remains purposeful and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but "thoughts percolated through ambient awareness, rising bubbles in the coachman’s mind" exhibits slight overwriting in a peak beat—figurative language risks muddling immediacy. No loops or artifacts touch closure, though one paraphrase loop ("releasing it, scent of petals flitting away") deducts marginally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms the ferryman trope through the yarn needle ritual and palimpsest contract, synthesizing mythic and domestic elements with emotional specificity. The braided hair reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, though the "gloom-hill" naming leans slightly on familiar archetypes without full personalization.</comment>
