<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to "discover the texture of connection" drives every action, with contradictory impulses (precision vs. vulnerability) embodied in her distorting memories and cutting the keystone thread. Final choice earns closure through prior causality, though secondary characters remain collective rather than individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mara’s memory inversion ("silence learned to her by birds") reconfigures the lattice with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (threads tightening), with cost legible in the inverted memory’s felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The planetarium’s dome isn’t backdrop but constraint—its spherical structure enables the thread mechanics, and the loosened threads humming with "low, forgiving light" charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping the closure’s emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: guest reactions deepen pressure as threads tighten toward collapse, driven solely by Mara’s agency. Cost is unmistakable when her memory inverts—"silence learned to her by birds"—reconfiguring her very identity with visible conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sinew threads and memory distortion without stating morals; the final image ("connection never resolves—only continues to be woven") reweights the premise with earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo while resonating through "stitched gaps" as concrete emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chalk that glowed like quiet lightning") modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during crisis ("Calmly, she climbed... scissors glinting")—with rhythmic control elevating tension. No POV leaks, though "rational enchantment" slightly strains lexicon without character justification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("dust motes erupted in a glittering sigh"). Figurative language serves clarity ("gasps fluttered like startled birds"), though "supple as violin strings" borders on stock simile without enough deviation to avoid minor deduction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through lab-grown sinew threads and "realistically imaginary" mechanics; emotional specificity ("stitched gaps where their wounds had been") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (internal climax via thread-cutting) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
