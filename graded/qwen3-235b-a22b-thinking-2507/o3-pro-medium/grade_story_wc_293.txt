<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "luminous disbelief became propulsion" shows earned shift, but hitchhiker's motivation remains abstract despite vivid embodiment; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("possibility thrummed in his chest like a freshly tuned string") under Accumulative/Textural lens; scaffold-to-catwalk transition tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wet-plate glass flake constrains choices (pocketed shard → fused lens) and charges final image; scaffold wrap's plastic sheets evolve from atmospheric detail to active pathway under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Avery's music sculpting planks from "ashes of 'never'", but hitchhiker's vanishing lacks causal escalation; cost ("thrummed possibility") feels earned yet insufficiently pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass lens capturing "choices both had buried", with final image ("lens warmed, promising amnesty") offering resonant non-literal answer to possibility vs. absence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light fractured along windshield shards" and musical cadence; no head-hopping, but "dynamically observant" label momentarily disrupts voice cohesion under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("moonlight projected lattice shadows across plywood like enormous pixels"), though "luminous disbelief" repetition in para 3/5 creates minor scaffold; closure image remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photographic and musical metaphors ("pixelated amnesty", "staff lines waiting for notes") transforms bridge-building trope; specificity of wet-plate glass prevents abstraction despite risk of "cities made of rain" cliché.</comment>
