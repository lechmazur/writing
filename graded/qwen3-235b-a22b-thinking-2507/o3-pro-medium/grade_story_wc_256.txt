<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's embodied contradiction ("powerfully gentle" movements vs. throat scars) and micro-choice to hum imperfectly earn closure through visible cost (lab's transformation). Senka remains secondary pressure only; underdeveloped status dynamics cap higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "connection can glow without burning" crystallizes the cost of abandoning purity for connection. Accumulative lens holds—density shift during static surge forces Lio's imperfect hum, reconfiguring the lab's purpose with felt cost in Senka's tears and dancing shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miner's lens constrains choices (must be clamped to fern armature) and charges closure as "beam that climbs the ceiling like dawn," transforming organ pipes into "tuned memory." Dusty pipes and wax cylinders actively pressure the experiment's fragility during the static surge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when static surge forces Lio to abandon performance for imperfect humming, narrowing options to "questioning assumptions." Cost is legible in Senka's tears and the lab's physical response (boards settling, pipes resonating), reweighting "purity preserves meaning" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "texture of yearning touching resistance" evolves into "braided light" closure without moralizing. Final image reweights "artificial pilgrimage" as strata of story, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity (imperfection enables connection).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("voice low as velvet thunder," "oscilloscopes gasp into life") modulates rhythm under pressure—short phrases during static surge. Purposeful compression ("dusty organ pipes glitter like brass reeds") taught early and paid off in closure's "glowing columns."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("lens splits the note into silent spectra, invisible ripples mapping seams") but minor synonym churn: "golden shadows" appears three times without sufficient reweighting. No figurative muddle in peak beats; closure propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "laboratory" trope through sonic archaeology specifics (wax cylinders, copper armature). Emotional truth in "raw joints of rhythm" avoids generic templates; the miners' percussive chorus reconfiguration feels inevitable from prior particulars, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
