<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied perception ("silence sounded louder") and micro-choices (slotted chip despite warnings), but pilgrim lacks contradictory impulses; "perpetually surprised" trait stated but not tested under pressure with visible tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "belonging was not a place but a constant song" crystallizes stance with felt cost (hollow answer, drained chip), sustained under Accumulative lens through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory's rusted wheel actively constrains tactics (drone towing effort), and "brilliant dimness" evolves from atmosphere to final "portable dusk" image; lacks one constraint on physical choice beyond telescope pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding belonging) deepens organically via matrix chip progression; cost crystallizes in "hollow answer" and drained lanterns, but timeframe pressure ("after arrival") lacks live-clock urgency to tighten decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Belonging as constant song" emerges non-literally from drone chord merging with lullaby; final "portable dusk" reweights "brilliant dimness" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nero's drone-pilot lexicon ("jerry-rigged port," "monsoon canyons") creates distinct perceptual signature; compression under stress ("Motors whined, gears protested") heightens pressure without losing coherence or voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied rhythm; minor scaffold in "he was perpetually surprised by how silence..." slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats (thrumming chord revelation).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech with celestial mysticism avoids templates; "frequency of belonging" transforms through specific execution (matrix chip decoding star trails), though observatory setting leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
