<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (polishing marbles while despising legacy); micro-decisions under pressure reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels. Final bow to roses crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost (redistributed luck) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors instantly; lens taught early via sensory accumulation. Final image reconfigures stakes with "Gardener" needle position.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains every choice (polishing site, root access) and charges final image through "blooming withering" roses. Sensory details filtered through vine dresser's expertise ("counts of last night's dew") avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) tightens via marble polishing action that alters tactics; cost manifests in redistributed luck gauges. Agency-driven escalation peaks when sap seals the crack, reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (mended deception → transparency) without moralizing. Final image of "blooming withering" roses offers non-literal answer to central question, resisting tidy resolution while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("murmuring counts of last night's dew") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from lyrical ("breath from something sleeping") to precise ("sap seeped into the seam") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density with "petals fresh and shriveled alike convulsed" doing triple duty. Slight overwriting risk in "breath from something sleeping and old" mitigated by pattern-teaching, but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of luck-as-statistics with gardening as faith. Risk-taking (sentient maze, sundial mechanics) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "blooming withering" motif feels inevitable in hindsight through prior particulars.</comment>
