<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied tech ("rage arcing yellow" tied to sensor data); contradictory impulses (preserve marvels vs. prevent shattering) drive the climax's self-sacrifice with visceral cost ("molten snow" pain).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: protagonist's body buffers the chord ("pain like molten snow"), reconfiguring the conservatory's survival under Accumulative lens; orientation flawless by paragraph one with "shattered dome" and "powdered starlight" anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory actively constrains choices (vibrations threaten shattering) and charges the final image ("luminous silence"); frozen ocean's "cracks refreezing into lattices" embodies the earned stasis with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: frequency choices narrow options until the final trade-off (body as buffer); visible cost ("molten snow" pain) reweights the conservatory's survival under Accumulative pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "heat-mapping emotions" visually answers "can silence become music?" without moralizing; final image of "luminous silence" reweights the conservatory as proof against abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath seemed printed rather than spoken") and rhythmic control under pressure; syntactic compression in climax ("Pain like molten snow...") heightens tension without muddying causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor scaffold in "I, the sole capsize survivor..." opening; "rage arcing yellow" skirts diagnostic phrasing yet remains embodied via sensor data, avoiding closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms disaster tropes through frozen ocean physics and silent vibration; "unshaken marvels" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (music as color) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
