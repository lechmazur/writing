<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Len's interiority shines through embodied choices (ribbon knots mapping sorrow), but his "collective grief" motivation lacks personal stakes—Harrah's presence doesn't pressure his decisions despite thematic resonance in their poem exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "porous" monument reweights grief as shared burden with felt cost ("people recognized their own grief... yet felt lighter"). Accumulative lens holds via butterfly migration tightening pressure toward the ribbon's auditory revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting constrains every choice—carving site, dining room, Mira's manifestation point—and charges closure through "butterflies traded burdens" imagery. Micro-setting (ribbon, chisels) directly shapes the monument's physical creation and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (materializing collective grief) escalates through Len's walks, with the butterfly migration imposing a live clock. Cost manifests in emotional labor ("carved through three nights"), though internal conflict could deepen the trade-off between solitude and communal healing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Avoids moralizing by embedding theme in action: porous monument and ribbon in resin reconfigure grief as shared without stating morals. Final line ("thundering calm... welcoming every future sorrow") offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of grief's shape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusk bled violet," "butterflies settled like commas") reflects Len's artisan focus. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the ribbon-knot revelation scene, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the closure's "fluttered eternally" cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "condensation on the pane" and "knots rustled though no wind" avoid filter verbs while advancing atmosphere. Minor deduction for "fiercely meditative" label in high-pressure beat, though redeemed by subsequent embodied action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms artist-trope through specific tools (ribbon roll, chisels) and butterfly migration framing. "Porous monument" synthesizes grief's duality with emotional precision, avoiding abstraction via resin-sealed ribbon and communal recognition at unveiling.</comment>
