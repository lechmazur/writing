<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fear of living" confession but fiancée backstory lacks micro-choice anchoring; diagnostic label-speak in climax triggers -0.4 penalty despite embodied tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: crown alignment creates resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (tears, vulnerability); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains every choice—quartz tiles guide path, singing spires affect perception, dew-charged spires charge final image; "resonant hush" evolves from weather to emotional state with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Roan's agency: shell alignment forces trade-off between inspection duty and emotional risk; cost (cracked barricades) legible in trembling fingertip and tears, though escalation lacks one visible prior sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell confessions dissolving "walls between hearts," culminating in non-literal answer via crowned pearl's color chorus; avoids moralizing but fiancée reference slightly over-tidies emotional progression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked geode," "tremulous wind" shells) modulates with pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("light poured... timid, then furious") taught early via "resonant hush" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "words scraped silence" climax but "latent radiance" phrase risks slight overwriting in two beats without pattern payoff, capping at 8.7 per artifact policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector + crystal confessions creates inevitable emotional truth; "crowning with confessions" transforms trope into specific moral calculus where vulnerability becomes tactical necessity.</comment>
