<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Basil's micro-choices (garage-sale messages, hesitating to weave alone), but "anticipated mysteries coiling outward" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty. Embodied emotion falters during the urn fragment climax where abstract phrasing dilutes visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "Basil exhaled, sensing his borrowed allotment slipping away" crystallizes the conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase (constellations of sensation-dates) reweights time's meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo's mineral coating constrains every tactical choice (dampening turbulence for Basil's work) and charges the final image (glowing "brighter than any noon"). Micro-setting mastery: moss and chaff aren't description but active pressure points.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Basil's agency—embedding messages, using the urn fragment—reweights the dominant stake through sensory density. Cost is unmistakable when his "borrowed allotment" slips during the constellations scene, making time's texture both victory and loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the urn shard's "loose thread" metaphor evolving into communal weaving, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("17 as cinnamon") offers resonant non-literal answer: time as flavor, not integers, with conceptual cost in Basil's fading presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrums with time-distortion lexicon ("torn clock faces," "velvet made of absent instants"). Purposeful elision (numeric upheaval backstory) is taught early and pays off in the garage-sale breadcrumbs' payoff, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density without muddle even in peak beats ("second hand straightened, no longer wobbling like a drunk compass"). Final paragraph's "glow brighter than any noon" recharges moss imagery with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time tropes through hyper-specific synthesis: garage-sale cryptography meeting astrolabe carving. Emotional truth in "time was not a river but braided cloth" avoids abstraction, while silo-as-loom risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
