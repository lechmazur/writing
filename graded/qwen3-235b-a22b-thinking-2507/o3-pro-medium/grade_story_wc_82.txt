<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "not banished sorrow; gave it wings," but brother's characterization remains thin despite pivotal role; micro-choices like spindle selection reveal value hierarchy with cost ("pain was acceptable").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "tears still refracted the torchlight"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density accumulation ("cranes bloomed from light") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tea garden's "porcelain cups on leashed clouds" creates vivid atmosphere but fails to constrain choices; lantern/gems charge final image yet lack tactical pressure earlier (e.g., no tool failure during polishing).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lyra's agency selecting brother's spindle despite searing pain; cost crystallizes in "pain restrained is pain multiplied" with stakes reweighted when cranes "craved an exit to the night."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image "shadows clasped bodies" delivers non-literal answer to grief transformation without moralizing; "wings that chose to stay" reweights premise with conceptual cost of luminous torment as necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "paper skin quivered like a luna moth"; rhythmic control peaks during transformation ("Lyra inhaled the music, then blew...") with zero register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "tears spotted the gems, introducing new prisms" achieves multi-jobbing density. Slight overwriting in "mobile of quiet catastrophes" barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief ritual (origami cranes in lanterns) transforms "shadow loss" trope; "borrowed light" concept feels inevitable through specific cultural details like "koi swimming through air like censers."</comment>
