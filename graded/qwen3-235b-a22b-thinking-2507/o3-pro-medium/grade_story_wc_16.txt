<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ada's "carefully reckless" nature drives tangible micro-choices (tying ribbons to shelves) with embodied cost ("secrets clung like sour ash"), though internal conflict slightly lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal transcription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence felt like rest, not rupture" reconfigures the opening rupture with conceptual cost ("sour ash" honesty), under Accumulative/Textural lens where ribbon lattice pressure narrows options through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive functions as active micro-setting—dust becomes musical notation, shelves groan in response—constraining Ada's choir-conducting tactics; ink well's refraction directly enables transcription and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: ribbon lattice mechanics (one falter = quivering lattice) and dimming lantern create irreversible pressure, culminating in harmonic enforcement of truth where cost is viscerally legible ("sour ash").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—conducting shelves as choir, treaties inked amid extinguishing ribbons—with final "unfinished tune" offering resonant, non-literal answer to "restore trust" without moralizing; "sour ash" crystallizes conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismed light swim inside the nib," "air vibrated like stirred water") modulates under pressure; syntax compresses during climax ("pulse racing, as they began speaking plainly") with zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; peak-beat prose ("secrets clung to their tongues like sour ash") achieves high density without muddle; final line's "unfinished tune" recharges opening motif with crystalline resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magic library" trope via specific mechanics (ribbons as tangible honor-lattice, harmonic pressure as enforcement); risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
