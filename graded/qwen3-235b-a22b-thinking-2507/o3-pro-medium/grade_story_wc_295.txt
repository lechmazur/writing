<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s grief-driven urgency versus Ariston’s lesson on shared burdens, embodied through her trembling hands on the telescope wheel when decoding the stone. Micro-choice to broadcast the warning reveals her hierarchy of values (duty over solitude) with tears as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s realization that burdens "anchor or propel" reconfigures the temple’s meaning with felt cost in Ariston’s death. Accumulative lens holds—stellar data density tightens stakes until dawn’s arrival crystallizes the shift from isolation to communal hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass eyepiece and phosphor screen actively constrain choices (e.g., "slow rotation of the geared wheel" guiding the telescope), while the daylily-pressed telegram charges the final image as solace layered upon solace. Recurring starlight transforms from "silver sanctuary" to "shared light," charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency: decoding shifts from personal quest to communal broadcast when she realizes Ariston’s error ("he had surrendered to despair"). The cost—his death from denying shared burdens—is legible in her tears and the telegram’s fragility, narrowing her path from solitary decoding to inviting others’ fragments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Carry the weight together" transforms from stone inscription to radio broadcast, with the final image ("burdens shared had already grown feather-soft") reweighting the temple’s warning without moralizing. No thematic echo—insight arises from Mira’s tactile overlay of starlight and glyphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Astronomer’s lexicon ("lightcurves," "RS Ophiel") filters emotions, while rhythmic cadence shifts from measured ("sidereal clock") to urgent ("pulse resolved into lightcurves") under pressure. No head-hopping; compression of grief via the telegram’s "fragile and fragrant" edges feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "fragile and fragrant" telegram description, but high density elsewhere: "jagged yet lyrical" lightcurves do triple duty as image, emotion, and plot device. No closure artifacts; final line’s "feather-soft" burden reprise avoids cliché through prior concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms astronomy tropes via specific epigraphic decoding method and the "rumor-oracles" threat. Emotional truth in Mira’s grief-driven urgency avoids generic solitude themes. Risk-taking (variable stars as braille) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable when glyphs align with stellar pulses.</comment>
