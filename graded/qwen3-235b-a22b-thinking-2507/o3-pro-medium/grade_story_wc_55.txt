<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "excruciatingly gentle" overused as label not action. Mother memory resolves conflict without present-frame micro-choice, violating BRR. Emotional progression too tidy despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with felt cost (condensation tears), but reflection block exceeds BRR limits without altering tactics. Accumulative lens holds, though mother memory's late arrival risks convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz benches and Oris Table constrain choices (creating space for silence) and charge final image. Petrichor evolves from scent to emotional residue, perfectly mirroring the thematic shift in the monastery's weeping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (making peace with abandoned dream) clear early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Mother memory resolves conflict coincidentally rather than through earned deepening of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing, but "intervals between emotions" insight borders on thematic echo. Final image ("time bearing itself... never rushing") resonates non-literally yet risks overstatement without sufficient prior tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petrichor nostalgia," "marrow of walls") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but "excruciatingly gentle" repetition creates subtle synonym churn. Overwritten moments ("glacial hush where the inner bell prepared to ring") slightly dull momentum without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms clockmaker trope through sensory specificity (quartz droplets as "minuscule voices"). Emotional truth in abandoned dream arc elevated by petrichor-as-memory motif, though "hidden sunrise" framing feels slightly familiar.</comment>
