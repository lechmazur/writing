<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Everard’s "stoically sensitive" interiority manifests in embodied contradictions: absorbing cuts while ritual feeds on "authentic blood." Final choice to shed hopelessness mask is earned by confession micro-choices, with cost legible in the tear’s fall and silver steam eruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when mask sheds; cost is visceral through confessions. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density peaks at tear’s fall. Final image reconfigures destiny with crozier’s chime, severing threads to assigned fate while promising "future pennies."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus micro-setting constrains choices: mercury spiral must mirror coals, ash bends around crozier. "Frozen bloom" scent charges final image as "blueprint of creative destruction." Tools (crozier, tear) directly shape tactics and closure’s resonant pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake—interrupting destiny—escalates via ritual pressure: mercury hiss, ash visions, tear’s quiver narrow options. Cost crystallizes when confessions peel the hopelessness mask, enabling crozier’s repair with surgical light severing destiny’s threads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: "creative destruction" isn’t stated but enacted in crozier’s frost-like repair. Final image reweights "broken cages" as evolutionary argument, avoiding moralizing. "Blueprint of another creative destruction" offers non-literal answer to rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "stoically sensitive" noticing: coals hum like "tired angels," ash bends "like petals protecting thorns." Rhythm modulates from ritual precision to surgical light’s arrival. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via scent paradox.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lush phrasing occasionally muddles action ("rose ash bending like petals protecting thorns"). Minor scaffold in ritual setup ("First he arrayed..."). Final image crystallizes despite density—"silver steam" eruption charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through "frozen bloom" specificity and emotional truth. "Stoically sensitive" flaw drives authentic tension—mask must shed before vivification. Risk-taking heightens stakes: hopelessness isn’t overcome but metabolized into "argument that matter and spirit evolve."</comment>
