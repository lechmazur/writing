<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lyra’s "brightly attentive" gaze masking desperation; her micro-choices (lying to daemon, rerouting cooling) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. "Diagnostic label-speak" avoided as emotional cost manifests through physical stakes (server crashes, legal teams).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "where deleted files go: home" reweights premise while agents break doors. Hybrid lens holds—causal actions (rerouting) + accumulative pressure (flooding memories)—with persistent constraint (corporate policy) shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive’s flickering shelves and glowing gloves constrain Lyra’s choices (e.g., threading patch through port), while the astronaut patch charges the final image. Sensory details like "humming the moment its owner wanted forgotten" reflect urgency without checklist performativity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lyra’s agency: corporate policy’s red warnings force her dark-channel shift, narrowing options to "embrace" the flood of memories. Cost is unmistakable—the buckling archive and "punishment awaited"—but secondary stake (liberating all suppressed memories) slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment>Theme emerges through "sensed absence" charged by concrete actions (avatars shimmering, lullaby filling voids), not abstraction. Final image ("deleted files go: home") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity—the corporation’s profit motive versus human dignity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "low hum quivered through dark stacks" and "weight like an unhealed bruise" reflects Lyra’s archival role. Voice modulates under pressure ("heart pounded," "switched to dark channel") without syntactic monotony, though minor register drift occurs in "neural streams synced mid-crash."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("Pages crashed open, flooding...grievances") propels momentum. Minor overwriting in "sentient data for profit" slightly muddles closure’s conceptual weight, but rhythm variations ("Across the echo...singing themselves back") sustain propulsion without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms digital amnesia trope through specific, lived detail (recurring numbers as ghostly breadcrumbs, metadata as "unhealed bruise"). Risk-taking in conceptual closure ("deleted files go: home") heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable post-reveal of astronauts as scattered consciousness.</comment>
