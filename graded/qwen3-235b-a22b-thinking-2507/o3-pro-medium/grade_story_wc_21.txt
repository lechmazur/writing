<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "tension knotted her motive" tells rather than shows conflicting impulses. Micro-choices lack hierarchy—arranging debris feels reflexive, not value-driven under pressure. Final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned but lacks embodied cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "no longer starless, but storied" reweights truth’s cost with undeniable social weight. Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds—retrocognition escalates pressure, debris arrangement crystallizes stance. Cost visible in evaporating tears and temporal bridge strain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choice (arranging debris) and charges final image—its starless reflection becoming "storied" reconfigures truth’s physicality. Sand/water specificity mirrors Mara’s tension; kerosene smell in retrocognition narrows perception under crisis. Micro-setting as active constraint elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety) tightens through Mara’s agency: requisitioning kite, arranging debris, demanding coordinates. Cost legible in temporal bridge strain and evaporating tears. Escalation driven by her choices under accumulative lens, but secondary conflict (past/present) lacks interweaving depth at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "documenting truth was another form of revolt" crystallizes through debris messages and word-kayak metaphor. Final image ("storied" lagoon) offers non-literal answer to "Why trust the future?"—no moralizing, only charged resonance. Avoids thematic echo via embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archival precision ("gloved fingers," "encrypted scheme") shifts to lyrical compression under retrocognition ("sand like static"). Rhythm modulates with pressure—terse sentences during seizures, flowing cadence in dialogue. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at lagoon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "pages shimmered with ink that refused chronology" compresses backstory. One scaffold—"heart hammering between centuries" slightly generic—but redeemed by immediate sensory shift to kerosene. Final image’s concision ("no longer starless, but storied") avoids overwriting. Filter verbs minimal in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes: retrocognition as tool (not curse), truth as "incendiary" through debris messages. Emotional specificity in "tears evaporating in briny air" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (hybrid time, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—lagoon’s transformation feels inevitable, not clever.</comment>
