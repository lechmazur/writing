<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (filing gear by feel while mapping "valleys of loss"), with flaws compounding authentically; the Earned Stasis closure—enduring with renewed purpose after permanent sensory loss—is causally earned by her tactile restoration work, though a hairline abstraction in "geography shift" slightly blurs emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: Amira's "screw of doubt turned free" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("nose empty yet heart replete"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the fog-to-clarity cadence shift reweights stakes through sensory density, with the water clock's "drops counting wonders" making conceptual cost legible on the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw (micro-setting) constrains every pivotal choice: it forces cannibalizing the water clock, drives the tactile restoration, and charges the closure as "dawn itself"; its evolution from corroded heirloom to symbol of continuity makes environment inseparable from Amira's emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven purely by Amira's agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to file the donor gear narrows options while trusting texture over scent—yet Laleh's coincidental arrival slightly softens pressure; the visible cost ("screw of doubt turned free") unmistakably alters her emotional tactics, charging the final image with earned vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through sensory particulars: Amira "reading between lines" via droplet surface tension reweights absence as perceptual expansion, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("drops counting wonders") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without abstraction, making wisdom feel earned through her lavender oil test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("textures spoke in subtle Morse") and rhythmic control under pressure—compressed syntax during filing ("She unscrewed..."), flowing cadence at resolution—teach the pattern early; voice modulates perfectly from "trembling calm" urgency to lullaby steadiness, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("tracing rivers of rust the way she once mapped emotional terrain" does triple duty) with crystal-clear propulsion. Figurative language ("sparks painting fogged windows gold") enhances rather than obscures, and the final line’s rhythm crystallizes closure without a single muddled metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis reframes sensory loss as perceptual expansion: the specific lavender oil test (reading droplet beading) transforms tropes into emotional truth. Risk-taking—using sound to "smell"—heightens stakes cohesively, though a near-echo of "reading between lines" slightly tempers originality.</comment>
