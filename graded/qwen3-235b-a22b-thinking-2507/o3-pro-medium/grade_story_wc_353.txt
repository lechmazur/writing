<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lack of internal conflict or meaningful trade-offs limits motivation depth; Lark's flawless execution undercuts "genuine struggle" despite strong embodied choices like breathing with bark vibrations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("settled into a listening, living hush") lands with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from early orientation to resonant final leaf tremor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove actively constrains choices (dawn interval requirement) and charges closure; porcelain insulator's "afterglow" makes micro-setting indispensable to final image's transformation of silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through texture accumulation ("fracture a miniature flute") but lack visible price altering tactics; conceptual cost in transformed hush meets band guardrails yet falls short of 8.8+ requirement for tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final leaf tremor recharges opening hedgehog image as resonant answer to "empathy in motion" without moralizing; theme emerges purely through physical particulars like deer sensing "meaning" not sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("day feels afraid to breathe") and rhythmic control during strumming sequence showcase masterful voice; no head-hopping, with elision (hedgehog movements) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture ("hairline faults hummed, each fracture a miniature flute"); final image recharges opening with crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sculpture/music through stress-crack acoustics avoids abstraction; risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry but hedging on emotional complexity caps near 9.5.</comment>
