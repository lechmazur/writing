<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hope vs insomnia) drives watering/painting micro-choices; embodied exhaustion post-magic shows cost. Flaw: hospital backstory reflection slightly exceeds BRR without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (moon promising "another chapter") reconfigures hope with visible cost (physical collapse). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: sensory density shift (bioluminescent moths → city reactions) reweights "kindness" stake. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice (watering drooping herbs, brush storage) and charges final image (curling among vines). Smog/moonlight directly enable/disable magic. "Saffron quiet" evolves from bulb glow to earned tranquility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness remembered) tightens via brush’s luminescent script → citywide impact. Agency clear in air-painting; cost (physical collapse) alters tactics (rinsing brush, sleeping). Single deepening suffices, but moon’s "dawn" dimming slightly softens price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through calligraphy’s literal germination ("seeds in winter") and final moon image. Avoids moralizing: "strangers remember kindness more stubbornly than smog" shown via taxi driver/elderly woman reactions. No thematic echo; complexity in "city forgot quickly" counterpoint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brown industrial haze," "saffron quiet") reflects painter POV. Rhythmic control peaks in brush sequence (short clauses for magic: "Symbols emerged—part fern, part constellation"). Zero head-hopping; tension in "horns stabbed like impatient birds" vs "luminescence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density but avoids muddle: "bioluminescent moths" crystallizes magic economically. Minor scaffold in "daydreams... courier" paragraph (redundant "smog" references). Final line’s "saffron quiet he had sown" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism via painterly specificity (brush "delicate as dragonfly’s wing," "chlorophyll alphabet"). Fresh synthesis: "lost languages" as biological calligraphy. Risk in quiet closure pays off through motif recharging (moon → "another chapter"). No derivative templates.</comment>
