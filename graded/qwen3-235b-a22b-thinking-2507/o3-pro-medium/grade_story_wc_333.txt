<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Orin's competence feels unearned without struggle against the clasps. Strengths: embodied emotion in hair-touching moment reveals stored tenderness under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with city's transformation, but conceptual cost ("fear loosened") remains nebulous. Strengths: Accumulative lens holds with starlight-to-syllable intensification reweighting cosmic hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus constrains choice via starlight dependency, and cedar box/hair function as micro-setting charging the final image. No white-room syndrome; "lampblack arches induced hush" filters through Orin's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("fear" as antagonist) with no visible cost to Orin; tension relies on poetic density over causal pressure. Strengths: Syllable's release narrows options through irreversible city-wide resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "enveloped secrets" reweighted by the empty box, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("faint song rose") offers non-literal answer to "idea trapped behind fear" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "twilight dust spiraling" and "dawn wraps chill fields"; rhythmic control intensifies during unlocking. Zero POV slippage; lexicon stays within Orin's mystical tradesman voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "fear still webbed... gauzy but stubborn" dulls closure beat. Strengths: Zero figurative muddle; "syllable wrought of luminous turquoise" delivers high-density propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via specific "luminous turquoise syllable" detail, but emotional complexity lacks risk. Strengths: Bold synthesis of locksmith craft with cosmic stakes avoids generic symbolism.</comment>
