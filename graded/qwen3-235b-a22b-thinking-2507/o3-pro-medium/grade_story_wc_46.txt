<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stillness must be offered, not kept" with embodied cost (tear on shard, lighter heartbeat). Flaw motivation slightly abstract—why "lest stillness stagnate?" lacks concrete dramatization of consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: pearl's emergence crystallizes options ("must be offered"), cost legible in "empty satchel" and settled memories. Accumulative lens holds through polishing rhythm deepening the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's micro-setting (granite table, pool) constrains choices—polishing requires wet stone, pool receives the pearl. Final image of glimmers guiding villagers proves environment charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake escalation driven by agency: polishing intensifies ("polished harder") to create pearl, with visible cost (leaving shard guardian). Deepening reweights options but lacks narrowing of choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image—glimmers guiding villagers without torches—resonantly answers "how to share light without fire" without moralizing. Theme emerges from tactile particulars (tear on glass, lilies of stillness).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "chasing a tone she called zephyr bloom," sea glass as "scattered constellations." Rhythmic control peaks in closure ("glimmers that slipped from the pool like shy stars").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "hush pulse" (para 5) slightly awkward phrasing is the sole minor artifact. Final beat crystalline: "light petals drifted across her skin without heat" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "earthbound star watcher" reframes astronomy through tidal memory. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes but closure remains legible—no gimmickry.</comment>
