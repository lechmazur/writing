<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied choices ("mouth closed, heart open") and concrete motivation to honor histories, but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal dissolution moment; micro-choices like forehead press reveal value hierarchy without over-rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("knowledge no scholar could footnote"), perfectly aligned with Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure intensifies through prismatic ghost accumulation and tidal stakes without causal breaks, cost legible in the city's transformed reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alchemist's market functions as essential micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., "impossible to reach river" forcing moon ritual), but physical layout rarely actively pressures decisions beyond spatial logic; final image charged by "streets shimmered" yet environmental constraint isn't consistently tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens as vision deepens ("prismatic ghosts stepped onto the panel") and stakes turn tidal; cost unmistakable in fragment's dissolution creating irreversible conceptual transformation, with "weight of future errands" altering Irida's physical stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "anchors of intuition" motif, with ending offering non-literal answer via child's salt-breeze knowledge; avoids moralizing through concrete particulars ("lighthouse moved home") while embracing complexity in unfootnotable historical truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light held dialects no alphabet dared speak") and rhythmic control under pressure exemplified in vision sequence's fragmented syntax; patterned elision taught early pays off in dissolution scene with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "elusively tangible" repetition slightly dilutes density in peak beats but doesn't obscure closure; final line's "knew, without knowing how" demonstrates masterful rhythmic compression that heightens pressure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator archetype through light-based mechanics and "anchors of intuition" concept; risk-taking with Accumulative structure succeeds as quiet dissolution ending heightens stakes, though not quite inevitable in hindsight due to minimal historical friction.</comment>
