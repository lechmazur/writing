<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (warrior/poet) drives micro-choices like unsnapping gauntlets; embodied emotion ("tears he had long forgotten how to shed") avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of "wars, titles, loneliness" earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "named the place Possibility" crystallizes options with visible cost (shed identity). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to dissolution of glass into "swirling script." Cost legible in "tears... forgotten how to shed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice (eternal night forces internal duel); mercury apple directly enables climax. Final image ("vines blossomed into corridors of dawn") recharges setting with cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing possibility vs. war-hollowed void) tightens when missing page mirrors his void. Escalation via deepening: heartbeats drumming tempo shifts duel inward. Cost unmistakable as "surrender fear" alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marionette program's evolution—from war relic to cosmic script. Final image ("pages settling like snow") answers central question without moralizing, reweighting "possibility" through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sap-slowed leaves," "frayed like history's eyelids") modulates rhythm under pressure. Elisions (dream-lightning map) taught early; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "uncertainty spread like mildew" slightly dulls high-pressure beat. Zero loops/scaffold, but stock metaphor in scarecrow drooping costs 0.1. Final line’s "snow" crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: "alchemical orchard" not generic magic forest, "unsnap" motif (visor/gauntlet/hinges) synthesizes physical/emotional change. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
