<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Felicity's interiority is concrete ("eyes bright as seaside glass") and micro-choices under pressure feel authentic, like her chalk interjection before fear stiffens the circle. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure through their artifacts, though the fisherman's motivation remains slightly underdeveloped compared to others.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when the kitchen table image reweights meaning-making with undeniable cost: characters depart carrying "private plans" after realizing cosmic secrets are secondary to mundane reorganization. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through the sand mandala's evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sand mandala functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Felicity's wrist flicks) and charges the final image when erased. "Lilac unease" chalk's sensory specificity ("tingled against damp skin") filters all perception through Felicity's artistic lens, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives the escalation: Felicity's violet swirl creates the decisive deepening that reweights stakes from seeking prophecy to embracing reorganization. The cost is palpable in "hearts banging against ribs" and characters leaving with "emptier nets," narrowing options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sand mandala's transformation into the kitchen table—a resonant, non-literal answer to "discovering meaning in the mess" without moralizing. The final line ("awaiting new mess and newer meaning") recharges prior material with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "mapping jagged walls in an instant" and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats ("Lines forked like river deltas"). Voice modulates beautifully from lyrical ("mist coiled like shy ribbon") to precise ("dusted the mandala's center") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lilac unease" motif accumulates meaning without overwriting. Final line ("awaiting new mess and newer meaning") resolves with textural specificity that recharges the opening mist imagery, achieving high density without sacrificing clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artistry with philosophical inquiry avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details like "powdered chalk onto cleared sand." Risk-taking in the Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the "unlearning" festival concept slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
