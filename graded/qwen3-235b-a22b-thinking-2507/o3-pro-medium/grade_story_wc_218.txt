<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's contradiction—frail body versus brazen calm—drives her final experiment with embodied cost ("translucent slivers" of sleep). Her "gently systematic" precision manifests in tidal choreography and micro-choices like soldering junctions, avoiding epiphanies for earned stasis as her pulse grafts to the island.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (luminous runes revealing shared branching math) carries undeniable conceptual cost: Mara's death enables the villagers' sudden intimacy with life. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (crabs, dolphins, priest's tingle) that tightens toward the moonlit chord, with cost legible in "months shrinking faster than thirsty soil."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard constrains every choice: tidal tables dictate wiring windows, basalt pillars complete circuits, and the copper wire's conductivity enables interspecies language. Final image ("copper roots carrying her pulse outward") charges the recurring stone setting with irreversible transformation, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: Mara's "allotted months shrinking" forces accelerated wiring, narrowing options to the final listening. Cost is visceral in her "translucent slivers" of sleep and the priest's echoed pulse, culminating in the chord's "deep enough to shake memory" that reweights her mortality as communal revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—kids naming plastic bottles alongside shells, dolphins synchronizing clicks—not moralizing. The runes' "identical branching math" offers a non-literal answer to interspecies respect, avoiding thematic echo while reweighting the orchard's purpose through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice embodies Mara's scientific-poetic duality: "handwriting disciplined yet looping like tide lines," her song as "inventory of species, rendered as thanks." Perceptual signature filters salt crust, crab antennae, and copper tingle through her caretaker lens, with rhythmic control that accelerates during soldering yet breathes in moonlit closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous veins running like breath through stone" exemplifies high-density imagery. Sentence rhythms vary organically ("Sea wind hummed along the wire" vs. "Dolphins began circling"), with no figurative muddle even in peak beats. Final line's "island's endless breathing" crystallizes propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms eco-fiction tropes through specific linguistics: copper-wire "amphibious fugue" and crabs hearing "portents of moonrise quotas." Emotional truth anchors universality in Mara's death-driven experiment, with the runes' branching math feeling inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
