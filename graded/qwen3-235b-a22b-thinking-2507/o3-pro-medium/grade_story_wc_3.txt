<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief-driven "ache to understand" creates authentic contradiction between scientific rigor and haunted longing; micro-choices like translating "kindly methodical even to a tree" reveal embodied tension without therapy-speak, though sister's absence edges toward abstraction in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with legible cost ("ambitions settled... still within touching distance of grief"); Accumulative lens holds through pollen mapping to photon lattice, but sister's presence borders on convenient resolution despite textural cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor functions as indispensable micro-setting: magnetite vines guide navigation, suspension fields constrain action (platforms lifting), and final image ("holding space between worlds") charges closure with environmental specificity that reweights transition physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Aram's agency—tapping nodes, modulating voice—deepens knowledge to crystallize stance; Uruk door analogy creates pivotal narrowing of options with unmistakable cost in "ambitions settled," though physics-test beat slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: photon streets as childhood memory, "nothing lost only translated" earned by mapping threads; ending reweights "touching distance" into resonant "echo" without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct translator voice shines in rhythmic precision ("tapped each node," "fingers steady") with compression under pressure, though "absurdly" when seeing photon streets creates minor register drift against methodical persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm while packing density ("spirit leaves rustled past her coffin"); lightning-as-"patient tutor" risks slight metaphor stretch but pays off through Aram's methodicalness, never obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform translation with quantum grief bridge avoids abstraction; "gate held open by memory" transforms trope through specific lived detail (fingerbreadth lifts, grief-tones meter), with risk-taking deepening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
