<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orin's contradictory impulses (fear of the unknown vs hope for connection) drive the trapdoor scene; Barrow's "exhale as if agreeing, or forgiving" uses therapy-speak undermining embodied emotion at peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with wind's shift from "frightened" to "wild" hush carrying conceptual cost of broken silence; orientation clear by line 3 but "tinted revelations" insight stated not embodied weakens cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waxed leaf constrains choice (seal-opening) and charges final image as "portable sunrise"; irradiated glass "painting afternoon in uncertain jewels" masterfully filters setting through Orin's translator lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Orin's agency: leaf's wax softening lead seal forces commitment to journey; cost legible in "shadows stretching like antennae" as safety is forfeited for uncertain connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "portable sunrise" final image reweighting silence-as-lie premise; undercut by explicit "silence itself was a lie" statement triggering -0.6 thematic echo penalty in Q5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "words cling to me in intuitively descriptive haze"; rhythmic control peaks with "bruised stars" descent into "chambers of encoded night" teaching compression paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive haze" label-speak in final third violates peak-beat abstraction rule; otherwise flawless propulsion with "violet shards" and "portable sunrise" achieving textural density without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph cylinders as message vessels transforms apocalypse tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative lens pays off through "waxed leaf" motif charging every beat with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
