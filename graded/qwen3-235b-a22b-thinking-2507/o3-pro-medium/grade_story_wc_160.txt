<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (e.g., "sweat mingling with ash" after danger) avoids therapy-speak, but "encrypted compassion" label risks thematic echo; micro-choices like looping the chain reveal values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: fissures pausing with "edges cooling" crystallizes tension with visible cost (Mara's exhaustion), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors within 100 words via volcanic setting and character introduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic mist warms adhesive to reveal patterns—a recurring object constraining choice—charges the final image where "dappled resolve" emerges from ash-sweat fusion; sensory details reflect urgency (crisis narrows to steam/chain vibrations).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (harmonizing tradition/invention) tightens via Mara's agency: surge mapping forces gate calibration, altering tactics (dialing console); cost legible in "fissures crawling toward terraces" despite initial success, deepening pressure without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through volcanic breaths and chain vibrations, but final paragraph's "conflicting values had not vanished; they had only been tuned" explicitly states the thesis, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spectral dust arranging into branching patterns") modulates under stress; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical opening to staccato crisis ("Mara sprinted... dialed open"), with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-duplicate phrasing ("as the building breathes" repeated verbatim) triggers -0.3 loop penalty; otherwise, high density ("sluice gates carved in bedrock would open just enough to exhale heat harmlessly") propels momentum without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering and emotional cartography ("coded chimes... inviting rivals to parley") feels inevitable; avoids trope safety by making "encrypted compassion" a tangible algorithm with stakes, not abstraction.</comment>
