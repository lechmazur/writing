<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details like thumb circling the drawer pull during Ilren's assessment, but Mara's final choice lacks sufficient pressure escalation for 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under ritual constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the silver twine threaded through the pull embodies "reconciliation needs steady weight" with undeniable conceptual cost, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through the final image of chains "remembering how to open."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet actively constrains choices (mist obscuring lanterns, wind stealing syllables) and charges the closure when Mara listens to the "hush unspool" as chains below remember opening—environment shapes the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through moon-phase ritual, but the conceptual cost of "steady weight" remains slightly abstract; pressure tightens via untying silver twine yet lacks visceral escalation for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of threaded twine reweights the drawer pull motif into a non-literal answer about reconciliation, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material—thematic resonance emerges purely from concrete actions like Ilren's astonishment at untethering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hush felt furrowed," "gale stealing syllables") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; zero head-hopping despite dual captains, and compression (e.g., "calm washed him") pays off through taught patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Brass burnished dull" compresses history into texture, but "hope flickered in the creases" slightly edges toward stock phrasing, narrowly missing 9.5+ despite otherwise immaculate density and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner exchange tropes through lock mechanics ("any lock could remember opening") and moon-phase diplomacy; risk-taking (Accumulative lens for high-stakes negotiation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
