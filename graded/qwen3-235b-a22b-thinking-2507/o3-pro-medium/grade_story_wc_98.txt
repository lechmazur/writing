<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("luminous doubt") embodied through physical tremors and hesitation; micro-choices like chewing orchid stems under pressure reveal values. Final decision to sail lacks sufficient escalation of internal conflict before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost (hurried departure), but lens ambiguity undermines escalation—Accumulative buildup shifts to causal sprouting without clear teaching, triggering -0.4 deduction per rules. "Ripple of wind" payoff remains resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: ridge soil enables marble excavation, orchids provide dream catalyst. Monsoon timeframe pressures tactics visibly. "Clay marbles exactly where dream children had played" exemplifies environment charging closure through specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via monsoon deadline, but protagonist agency remains passive—dreams dictate actions until final question to the shoot. Late escalation (asking if seed remembers futures) barely qualifies as meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens; cost feels external rather than earned through choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete artifacts (etched marbles, driftwood verses), not abstraction. Final petal-boat image answers "how memory guides" non-literally. Avoids moralizing, but "empirically whimsical" trait lacks integration with thematic cost, capping resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic dreaming ("colors seeped from moonlight"), rhythm modulates from lyrical to staccato during sprouting. Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in reality-checker's lexicon even under duress ("heard through it the hidden marbles rolling").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor density issue in high-pressure beat: "delight that the island cooperated, fear that it merely performed" stacks abstract labels where embodied action would heighten stakes. No closure artifacts; sprouting sequence ("shoot emerged, pale gold veined with violet") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "memory keeper" trope through tactile verification (excavating marbles, chewing orchids). Ear-shaped fruit embryo reconfigures memory as active guidance—a fresh synthesis growing from ridge-specific stakes. Monsoon urgency edges toward cliché but redeemed by cultural specificity.</comment>
