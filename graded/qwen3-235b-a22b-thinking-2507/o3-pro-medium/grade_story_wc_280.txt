<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs wonder) act simultaneously as narrator "breathes echoes" under pressure; final choice to be late earns closure through "debts settled only when possibility hears its own name" with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "time is no longer fractured but facet-cut" reconfigures stakes with felt cost in "linoleum will never echo like this remembered applause" under consistent Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (indigo apples) charges final image by reappearing in "facet-cut time" reconfiguration; every sensory detail ("saffron heartbeat") constrains choices during time-mending sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: "breathe echoes" choice narrows options into twin time rails; cost unmistakable in sacrificed work punctuality with "debts" framing the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of citrus-light clapping offers resonant answer to "mending time" without moralizing; "nostalgia feels earned, not borrowed" reweights prior abstract longing through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("colors sing C-sharp in my nostrils") shows synesthetic bias; rhythmic compression during climax ("I inhale, exhale") pays off early elision of sensory logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "heartbeat becomes a metronome whose ticks I can taste as saffron" achieves triple duty without muddle; final line recharges opening "whispers" with "echoes are plentiful".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Risk-taking (synesthesia as time-mending tool) heightens stakes; "facet-cut time" transforms trope into inevitable image that deepens emotional truth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
