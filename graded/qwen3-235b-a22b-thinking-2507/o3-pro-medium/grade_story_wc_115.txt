<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "belief felt like gravel in my mouth" and radio-pattern collecting as embodied skepticism. Final choice to keep the wheel unsold earns endurance with visceral cost in "lighter by the exact weight," though "religious skepticism" label slightly precedes demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "truth heavier in memory than in gut" crystallizes conceptual cost through the wheel's SHIFT SETTLED click. Accumulative lens holds from confession to bead-spinning with no causality breaks; persistent constraint of swallowed logbook shapes every ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel actively pressures choices—"drip timed heartbeats," chill seeping through jeans—while valve wheel as micro-setting constrains the ritual. Final image of walking into dawn gains charge from earlier "coal dust refusing to settle," fulfilling 9+ gate via tool charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: sharing radio patterns triggers Caleb's logbook confession, narrowing options to the wheel ritual. Cost is unmistakable in "chest tightened between prayer and audit," though drowsy alertness could deepen integration with pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: guilt weighed via valve wheel clicks, not moralizing. Final line "lighter by the exact weight" reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding binaries while embracing complexity—no thematic echo risks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "drowsy alertness buzzed through temples" and compression justified by exhaustion. Voice modulates under pressure ("whispered fearing words might bruise quiet"), with elision of logbook discovery taught early and paid off in ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rosary for machinery" avoids cliché while "comet tails of graffiti" serves atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies from staccato ("Silence answered") to flowing ("dawn would spill along rails"), with no figurative muddle in the high-stakes bead-spinning climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms industrial ghost tropes via tangible mechanics: guilt measured through valve-wheel timecards and radio-pattern mapping. Risk-taking heightens stakes—abstract remorse made concrete—without gimmickry, passing transformation test with brass beads' irreplaceable click.</comment>
