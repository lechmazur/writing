<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is concrete (“quiet lodge behind his eyes”) and his peripheral focus actively shapes choices (moon glimpsed at edge of vision, final smile). Contradictory impulses—reason vs. wonder—drive the closure’s earned endurance, with cost visible in the “wounded season” bleeding silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the timer now “measures not seconds but memories,” reconfiguring stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (“rooftops shook off frost like old regret”). The accumulative/textural lens holds—pressure tightens through echo experiments, narrowing options to a single solution without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains every choice: its light angles dictate echo harvesting, and the pillars’ spark-catching forces Silas’s mirror tactics. Final image (“marble applauded, scattering motes like seeds”) charges closure, proving environment shapes the resolution’s core mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (“season would stop bleeding silence”) tighten through Silas’s agency—dawn/noon/dusk experiments deepen the echo pattern, forcing a trade-off between time and memory. Cost is visceral: “hours dripped away” yet he’s sustained by “secret thaw,” showing endurance’s price before the timer’s rebirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: “a good lock is never about closing; it is about knowing how music waits on the other side.” The final image (“music that could fit in his palm”) reweights the premise without moralizing, resolving into resonant ambiguity about wonder’s storage in reason’s cellar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“storms limped,” “echoes drummed like distant hooves”) modulates with pressure—lyrical during experiments, compressed during repair (“hours dripped away”). Rhythmic control avoids overwriting; the cavern’s “unplayed instrument” simile teaches the pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“light flared… scattering motes like seeds” merges image/theme). Minor register drift in “unplayed instrument” (−0.1) but no closure impact. Final beat (“Bells rang, not loud, but layered…”) propels with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment>Transforms tropes through specific detail: the “reflective locksmith” harvests echoes to reverse-engineer time as memory. Emotional truth in “forgotten capacity for ordinary awe” avoids abstraction; the marble cavern’s physics-driven solution feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</question>
