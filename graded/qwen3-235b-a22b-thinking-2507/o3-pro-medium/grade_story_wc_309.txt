<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("brilliant dimness") manifests in embodied micro-choices like clutching the keystone while pleading for "rainwater and turnip stew," avoiding epiphanies; closure choice to whisper blessings earns endurance with visible cost as quills falter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (automation's failure vs. Felius' "underachievement at failure"); accumulative/textural lens holds through density shift from "frozen tears" to "slow-moving dawn," reweighting stakes via the brazier flare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Keystone and icebound spire function as micro-setting: hoarfrost stairs appear only when "foot hovered," constraining choice; final image of "modestly warm" spire charges closure by reconfiguring the environment's meaning through ordinary blessings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Felius' agency (pressing keystone to frost), narrowing options from futile quill requests to embodied blessings; cost legible as "gears chewing soggy genius into mulch," reweighting automation's dominance through humidity's tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "cracked cups" and "uneven lullabies" reprinted on walls, rejecting categorical genius; final image of "sacred dimness" reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity via "dim enough to keep wondering."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in mage-specific noticing ("cogwork quills etching sonnets"), with rhythmic compression during mist walking ("world muffled to a hush"); avoids ventriloquism by filtering all description through Felius' underachiever lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "consonants kissing" exemplifies high-density prose, though "directions behaved like untrained pets" slightly drifts into elevated diction during high-pressure descent, dulling immediacy by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "underachiever" trope through specific magical logic where "brilliant dimness" becomes strength; risk-taking (rejecting automation for turnip-stew verse) heightens stakes coherently, with "soggy genius" reprise feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
