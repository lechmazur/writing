<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "pensive mirth pry open her chest" versus "shy bird refusing her palm"; revelation earned through prior causality when fresco fragment clicks with cherub, avoiding epiphanies without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands when Lina realizes she was the dancing child—cost crystallized in "trembling with both laughter and tears" and saplings pushing through earth, all under unbroken Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lantern constrains choice (painting with light vs pigments) and charges final image: "pear blossom woven from photons" fuses tool with closure’s rebirth, making setting indispensable rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: "suspected the orchard demanded reciprocity" forces light-sketching, narrowing options from passive search to active offering with visible cost in delayed joy ("hovered like a shy bird").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "pear blossom perfume" scent diagrams and candied citrus recipes resurfacing—final image of spectral/solid children dancing reweights "lost joy" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "mist rolled like weary thoughts" and "leaves the color of dusk" stays consistent; rhythmic control under pressure when "filament pulsed, mixing frequencies until light carried melody" avoids ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax; "saplings long dormant pushed buds through cracked earth" shows textural specificity. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" (Q2 comment) but closure beats immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "ruined orchard" trope through knowledge network’s "scent diagrams" and light-painted journal—emotional truth in "joy hovered like a shy bird" avoids generic nostalgia with pensive mirth.</comment>
