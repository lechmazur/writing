<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gerard's contradictory impulses (welcoming arrivals vs. imposing silence) manifest in micro-choices like matching Liora's breath to steady the noise meter. Flaws feel authentic—his "fluidly logical rhythm" initially fails to soothe her humming notebooks until he abandons rigidity for embodied connection. Final endurance of vigilance earns cost through visible "resumed" action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: Liora's sigh "resounding without sound" crystallizes silence as active comfort, with cost legible in passengers carrying "a share of the hush" away. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via meter readings and vial transformations, narrowing options toward stillness without causal breaks. Final image reconfigures transit as inner stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: glass gutters stars downward during pivotal walk, while balloons' creaking softens in response to calm. Storm glass directly charges closure when it "brightened until almost invisible," embodying Liora's transformed state. Environment shapes tactics—Gerard uses refracted light to "guide arrivals" and measure inner weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (silence as comfort vs. transit anxiety) signaled early via brass meter's ticks. Escalation driven by Gerard's agency: he builds "ladder of hush" through story pauses, directly causing notebooks' stillness. Cost unmistakable when "passengers paused mid-conversation, sensing the shift"—inner space alters external behavior. One deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "Silence is the last conductor" arises from Liora's realization, not moralizing. Final image of closed notebook yielding "memory of still wings" reweights silence as active force—resonant non-literal answer to whether quiet can comfort. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in silence as both gift and imposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Gerard "listened to spaces between sounds," noticing Liora's "papery vibrations fluttered like moth wings." Rhythmic control under pressure evident in monastery story's escalating pauses. Compression taught early ("breathless, still vibrating from the train") pays off in quiet climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere (e.g., "balloons overhead adjust to a gentler current" shows environmental response to calm). Figurative language precise—"ink stained her fingertips like dusk stains clouds"—never muddles peak beats. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction: "carrying a lesson cut from pure quiet."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms transit tropes through sensory mechanics: brass meter quantifies anxiety, storm glass mirrors inner weather. Emotional truth in archivist's anxiety ("notes hum even when closed") avoids cliché. Bold risk making silence the active force, with prism terrace's "vaulting hush" charging stakes beyond surface novelty.</comment>
