<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (calm gaze vs inherited trauma) through micro-choices like arranging bills to "dissuade the past," but Mira's exhaustion lacks embodied specificity. Diagnostic "data loops are habit loops" line triggers Q1 penalty for label-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("stepped onto the asphalt, neither fleeing nor chasing") with conceptual cost (leaving bills as guardians), but the "filmstrip of years" reflection exceeds BRR limits without altering present tactics, diluting causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned train actively constrains choices: sliding kyat under doorframe to "tell the night this place is already a story" directly charges the final image. Dust settling on mahogany panels mirrors Eliot's inherited calm, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen credibly through Eliot's agency ("I need to know why paths circle back"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure until Mira's late "data loops" line. Single deepening ("algorithm crashed against memorial loop") works for length, though cost emerges only at payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: "something vital stands guard where we pretend only numbers dwell" avoids moralizing by grounding insight in the trucky unions' backroad. Final image reweights premise without stated moral, though "warning etched in asphalt" flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind rattled trapeze chains in gentle applause") reflects Eliot's calm aestheticizing of tension. Rhythmic control peaks during realization ("patterns surfaced like crescent moons"), though Mira's "violin softness" slightly overwrites her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose excels in density and rhythm ("Smoke bled into sunset, blending sky and earth"), but "filmstrip of years that had flickered across a startup's rise and fall" creates mixed metaphor violating physical logic, triggering Q7 penalty that blocks 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms startup failure into universal insight about memory vs data through "territorial markers." Circus train avoids quirkiness by serving theme, with emotional specificity ("algorithm crashed against memorial loop") feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
