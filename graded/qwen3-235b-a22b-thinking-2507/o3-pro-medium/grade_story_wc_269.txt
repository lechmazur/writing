<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (aligning atlas margins with "cooled-careful fingertips") avoids label-speak, but lacks contradictory impulses during descent—calm professionalism overshadows visceral stakes despite "anxious curiosity" heartbeat detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Mara's door-tapping crystallizes vanishing paths as self-surrender, with conceptual cost in "tides have offered me another map." However, the cost proof test fails—no on-page image concretizes what she forfeits beyond intellectual pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea level station constrains every choice: warped paneling hides logbooks, tide sensors trigger observation, collapsing ground forces descent. Hydrophone rope marks directly charge the final image, meeting 9+ gate for micro-setting essentiality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening (negative elevation data → hydrophone test) narrows options under Accumulative lens. But the cost remains abstract—"anxious curiosity" lacks visible forfeiture; band guardrail caps scores without tangible price altering tactics at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: atlas/labyrinth convergence reweights "disappearing paths" as voluntary surrender. Final image ("tides have offered me another map") delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ocean whispered unsettled arithmetic," dust "miniature storms") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "patient library" metaphor during descent slightly dilutes immersion but doesn't fracture voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "rope marks corresponding to printed depth rings" compresses technical detail into action. Single figurative muddle ("water closed around her like a patient library") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.5+, but density remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms climate fiction tropes via specific mechanics (tapping as language, rope-mark depths). Risk-taking heightens stakes—lyric structure makes "vanishing paths" emotionally concrete without gimmickry, meeting 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
