<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "virtuously mischievous" actions under pressure (pocketing bolt, laughter during strain), but pyramid scheme trauma lacks causal weight in corridor climax—motivation relies too heavily on prior text rather than embodied choices at peak stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: diamond door coalescing from shattered timelines embodies "pressure into diamonds" with visceral cost ("shards of failed timelines shattered off"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density escalation, though bolt liquefying stone borders on convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mushroom farm micro-setting charges closure: bioluminescent caps becoming diamond-spore veins reweights the premise. Rusty porthole bolt constrains choices (socket placement) and appears in final image as hollowed necklace, fulfilling 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) tightens through corridor's physical density ("air dense as kneaded clay"), with cost legible in "swallowing thunderstorms" breaths. Agency shines as Cassia volunteers will, though "quantum promise" framing slightly over-intellectualizes the pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "weight makes stars burn" concrete realization, avoiding moralizing. Final spore-diamonds reweight "honest light" without stating morals, though glitchy text's "seed the world" phrase edges toward thematic echo in closing beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescence scraping flint") with rhythmic control—short, strained syntax in corridor versus lyrical calm in farm. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during quantum transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("velvet with rust," "tectonic beats") with minimal scaffold. Slight overwriting in "threads glowing, threads cracking" and "pulsing like tiny heartbeats" risks figurative muddle in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "pressure to diamonds" trope through spore-diamonds growing from shadow, with pyramid scheme survivor angle adding emotional specificity. Risk-taking elevates stakes, though "quantum promise" concept leans slightly generic without deeper rule exploration.</comment>
