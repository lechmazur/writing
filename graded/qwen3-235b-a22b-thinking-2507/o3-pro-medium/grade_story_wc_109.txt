<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oracle's contradictory impulses (mild eyes vs obsessed heart) drive micro-choices like stilling breath to protect the booklet; Brekan's shift to "apprenticed to quiet" earns his final stance with visible cost in armor creaking. Slight underdevelopment of Brekan's prior skepticism limits internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through Brekan's realization that noise = "burnt oil" pouring through cracks, with conceptual cost legible in "marching along the map etched in hush." Accumulative lens holds as the single star's fade tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gold leaf booklet constrains choices (crumbles with loud questions) and charges the final image as a "lone ember refusing dusk." Pebble shore and ridge fort's altitude directly shape oracle's tactics, with sensory details like "ground pearls" reflecting her professional priorities under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the single star's dimming, forcing Brekan's agency shift to "measured stillness" with unmistakable cost: "Should they break formation with noise, the night will find cracks." Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens as silence deepens into tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gold leaf's fragility and star compass without moralizing; final image of "fort and sea and storm bound inside a single breath" reweights silence as defense against chaos. No thematic echo—Brekan hears strategy "the way sailors hear land in a change of gull cries."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oracle's perceptual signature ("ambered hush," "surf's pulse") creates rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression in "summarizing silence" taught early. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent phrases slightly dilutes focalization during high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with lines like "gold flakes lifted like moths" doing triple duty, but "cindered rubies" to "luminous dust" creates subtle metaphor friction in the brazier description. Zero loops yet slight figurative density in the retelling beat risks muddling closure's urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through "summarizing silence" mechanics and specific "pebble-shore" details; the map drawn in Brekan's mind feels inevitable from prior particulars. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the "burnt oil" simile edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
