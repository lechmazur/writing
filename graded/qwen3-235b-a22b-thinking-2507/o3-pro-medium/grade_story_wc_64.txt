<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Milo's cheerful facade vs. echo sensitivity, but the tapestry resewing lacks visible struggle; final choice to return the case feels earned yet underplays cost during execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cemetery's hush shifting from ache to lullaby, but cost remains felt not shown; "velveteen gloom" hints at pressure yet fails to crystallize tangible forfeiture on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: sovereign case's tingling palm and yew's sighing soil constrain choices, while "lunar milk" and "velvet dust" charge the final harmonies with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving buried regrets) tightens via tapestry visions, but escalation lacks Milo's active struggle; pressure accumulates texturally yet cost stays abstract during resewing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "map stitched in grief" and final harmonies; avoids moralizing while reweighting "intentions" via Rowan's buried chess king without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "soil sighs steam" and "velvet hush," but rhythmic control falters during tapestry work; high-pressure moments retain lyrical uniformity without stress-induced compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, yet "velveteen gloom settles... soft yet deafening" stacks modifiers in peak tension; minor overwriting dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery trope via sovereign case and cobalt silo, but "gardener hearing echoes" premise lacks transformative specificity; emotional truth elevates near-familiar framework.</comment>
