<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines through embodied choices (guiding hands over seal) and contradictory impulses ("carefully resonant half truths" vs. acceptance of burden). Minor abstraction in "resonant half truths" slightly undermines concrete flaw manifestation at pivotal reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: rainwater seal impression scattering toward rooftops crystallizes the narrator's new burden with undeniable conceptual cost ("story I now owed them"). Orientation flawless; one tightening (seventh-week storm) suffices for Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop garden functions as active micro-setting: meteors dictate lesson timing, storm forces critical scene, and thyme/broken porcelain grounds the final image. Seal's physicality constrains choices (draining Selin) and charges dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through seal's deterioration ("letters bled light") culminating in the crack. Protagonist's agency in accepting Selin's request carries visible cost (dissolution), reweighting options under Accumulative/Textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("rooftops... expectant") offers non-literal answer to "why preserve memory?" through concrete burden of "syllables of sorrowful masonry." Theme emerges from "cracked pots wired with gold" metaphor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in architectural metaphors ("sparks stitched silver syllables"); rhythm shifts from lyrical calm to staccato panic ("shutters slamming"). No head-hopping; elision (Selin's death) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "waterlogged" voice and "flickered like film" show high-density imagery without muddle. Strategic telling compresses backstory into "allegedly preferred silence" with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost story via architectural linguistics: "First Lie Agreed Upon" concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in "guilt bound them like cracked pots wired with gold" avoids trope.</comment>
