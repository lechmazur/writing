<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in recognizing "traps shaped like gifts" while pursuing hunger stone; final choice to weave possibilities into stone earns visible cost through "liberty bore loneliness" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation ("tower shuddered, dust sloughed") to Charged Poise closure; cost crystallizes in "liberty bore loneliness" as ocean holds breath—conceptual price legible on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Latent radiance leaks from stones to guide descent and charge final image; yoyo's "gears smaller than barnacle teeth" constrain choices during reverse-engineering, making micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as tower shudders with each correction; cost manifests in "liberty bore loneliness" and "echoes of paths she no longer owned," foreclosing alternate timelines with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through counter-clockwise mechanics and hunger stone's visions; final image ("liberty bore loneliness") resonates as non-literal answer to "stepping beyond fate" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("air tasted of rusted salt," "gears smaller than barnacle teeth") reflects clockmaker's precision; rhythmic control under pressure ("fingers darting like minnows") sustains Accumulative lens without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("bleak exhilaration" repetition) costs 0.3; otherwise flawless density—"dust sloughed from inscriptions describing shipwrecks, eclipses, and bargains never paid"—avoids figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms Faustian trope through "hunger stone satisfied by being woven into possibilities"; counter-clockwise mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes via Accumulative structure.</comment>
