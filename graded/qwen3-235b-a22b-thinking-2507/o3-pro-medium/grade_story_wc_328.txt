<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Milo's resentment-laced confession scene, but lacks sustained contradictory impulses during peak pressure; Devon's transformation feels earned yet the grief-to-delight mechanism slightly over-explains in Juniper's whisper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("sorrow metamorphosed into song"), lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through density escalation; cost proof clear in erased logs and chest-chirp reconfiguring grief's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flint arrowhead constrains choices (conductor for static) and charges final image ("flint that dreams of sky"); underground garden's photosynthetic murals and mulch vibrations actively pressure tactics during the Loamling summoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Milo's agency (recorder use, resentment confession) under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (reclaiming Devon) tightens through sensory density, though "missing return" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure affecting tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "bitterness needs soil" speech reweights into "cosmic joke" without moralizing; final image ("frostbitten hope... flint dreams of sky") offers non-literal resolution to grief-transformation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thyme curled its leaves like ears") with rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (brother's disappearance) taught early and paid off via mulch vibrations during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("amber sap to a workbench where a flint arrowhead gleamed like captive lightning") but "gravitationally playful" repetition risks slight overwriting in peak beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of cryptid research with grief alchemy; "Laughing Loamling" transforms template through specific emotional calculus (bitterness-to-song) and irreplaceable closure image recharging "frostbitten hope" motif.</comment>
