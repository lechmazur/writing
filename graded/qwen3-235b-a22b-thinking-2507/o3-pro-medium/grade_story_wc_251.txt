<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Silas rejects applause for "slow-growing shade," embodying his quiet rebellion. Motivation ("plant forests of second thoughts") drives tangible choices like the window displays, but micro-choices under pressure lack visceral embodiment beyond chess metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the town's paused breath crystallizes stakes with felt cost (mayor's slipping schedule, children requesting boards). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—the grotto's "amplified quiet" reweights the dominant stake through the final image of "every piece in motion."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto constrains Silas's actions (starlight requirement, kneeling for the puzzle) and charges the final image via "filings turned again." Mineral-blue walls and rose-window chess position transform setting into active pressure, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: the town's "brittle" mindset narrows options to Silas's quiet rebellion, culminating in the window displays' cost (Halvorsen's schedule slipping). Agency is clear, but the grotto's influence feels slightly convenient for deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess puzzles' "seeding" of second thoughts—no moralizing, just the resonant final image of "saplings sprouting" and "groves growing." Avoids thematic echo by showing contemplation's cost through Halvorsen's hesitation, not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("mist like a beckoning finger," "notation paper" moonlight), with rhythm tightening during the grotto scene. Minor register drift in "murmured strategy met legend" slightly disrupts Silas's voice, but compression serves the accumulative lens without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "iron filings swirling in puddles arranged into a companion puzzle" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Occasional density ("murmured strategy met legend") borders on overwriting but avoids muddying closure—figurative language pays off in the final "groves growing" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess coaching and mystical rebellion avoids tropes through specific details (page 72 atlas, rose-window knight). Risk-taking elevates stakes—the grotto's thought-bending could feel gimmicky, but its constraint (starlight, kneeling) grounds the quiet climax in tangible cost.</comment>
