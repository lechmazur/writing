<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin's "brittle devotion" manifests concretely through trembling palms and whispered apologies to drowned sailors; his shift from lukewarm to wiser is earned via sweat offering, though secondary pressure is absent in single-POV constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with visible cost (sweat altering bell's state), but tide reversal at "three" lacks causal motivation, slightly weakening escalation integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: keystone anchors flask, arches "sigh" with released pressure, yet fails 9+ gate as environment doesn’t constrain Orin’s choices during pivotal dripping sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) tightens via dripping-rate escalation, with sweat offering creating tangible trade-off; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but "tides reversing" feels coincidental rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "broken bell" metaphor reweighted at closure ("open-ended" bell awaiting dawn), avoiding moralizing; final line’s "safest form of devotion" edges toward thematic echo, narrowly escaping Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("patient blue" stones, "tepid waves" of magic) modulates with pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s "slow dripping of a perfect morning" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but "Hope, when fractured, becomes heavy enough to tilt the stars" introduces abstract muddle in high-pressure beat; otherwise high-density propulsion through concrete actions (sweat falling, fish hovering).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mending broken things" trope through specific cosmic mechanics; "lukewarm" as virtue rather than flaw feels fresh, with risk-taking (dripping rates as magic system) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
