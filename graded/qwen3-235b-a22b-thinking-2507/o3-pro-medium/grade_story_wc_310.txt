<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ikram's embodied contradiction shines in the coin-spinning moment—fear of annihilation versus gravitational pull of prophecy—earning Earned Stasis through micro-choices like touching the Cydonia coin. Backstory on photon-counting concretely informs his final decision without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the coin topples: "simplification after contraction was rarer than hope" crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity early ("stellar doubt murmuring through bones" blurs Accumulative/Situational) costs 0.3 despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brass bowl constrains choice throughout—coins singing different notes, five pulses mapping to birth cries—and charges the final image when starlight dims. Sensory hierarchy (burnt helium air, bruised nebulae) filters through Ikram’s recorder lens without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the coin stands "upright against logic," narrowing options to sourceward horizon. Cost is visceral in the dimming starlight and camp’s brittle lantern breaths. Agency-driven escalation peaks with the coin’s fall, reweighting "Go where echoes begin" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the brass bowl’s physicality: "wavelength align with purpose" gains resonance when the coin’s fall echoes birth cries, rejecting abstract moralizing. Final whisper to the sky—"answers arrived before courage to ask"—offers non-literal closure without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors crawling backward into white, as if embarrassed") modulates under stress with rhythmic control. Purposeful compression ("time... all edges and no middle") taught early pays off in closure’s backward smile. No POV slippage despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "chord impossible for one throat alone" does triple duty as image, tension, and prophecy link. Minor overwriting risk in "stellar doubt murmuring through bones" (mixed metaphor) prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "backwards prophecy" trope through coins’ physics—answers regretted, not predicted—and risk-taking with entropy-resetting "sentinel melody." Emotional specificity in Ikram’s photon-counting childhood avoids generic doubt, though "wavelength align" borders on abstraction.</comment>
