<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("unbend not break") manifests in embodied action tracing circles on ice, but emotional progression edges toward tidy resolution; sister's abandonment lacks visceral, contradictory physicality during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with mirror-thickening escalation, but "hidden teeth" lake roar feels coincidental rather than pressure-coherent; cost legible as confession carried into lake's memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cursed lake constrains choices via mist corridor and water stairs, charging the final image with "warlike serenity"; however, setting remains atmospheric rather than actively altering tactics beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through mirror confrontation where truth-telling thaws ice, but "hidden teeth" escalation lacks causal link to Inyara's actions; cost of released guilt visibly reconfigures her posture and the seed's vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unbending emerges organically through circles and seed vision, avoiding moralizing; final line's "future mirrors would never dare confess" slightly overstates resonance with abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trees remember battles," "mossy stepping stones") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping as voice compresses during descent with martial cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density falters in "skeins of mist" with slight register drift; minor synonym churn ("roared with hidden teeth" → "lake beneath roared") dulls immediacy but closure remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical fantasy with guilt-confrontation; "flesh-eating seed" transformed through ivory pod and runic apples to charge emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
