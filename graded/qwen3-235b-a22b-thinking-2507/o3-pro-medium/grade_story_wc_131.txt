<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (desire for visibility vs. methodical invisibility) drives choices; embodied emotion in "pulse fluttered like a moth"; micro-choice of humming Salcedo's interval earns closure. Secondary character lacks depth but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "holding a scrap of magnetized night" crystallizes remembrance as circuitry. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup. Minor deduction for pipe chase discovery bordering on convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Copper wire constrains choice (inducing phone charge) and charges final image ("ribs of the building"). Micro-setting functions perfectly within scope. Slight deduction for "sapphire hush" bordering on cliché despite strong reuse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (visibility quest) tightens meaningfully when student appears; dweller's agency in wire unwinding alters tactics with visible cost (enduring solitude after connection). Escalation perfectly calibrated for length under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: tape fragment → induced charge → "remembrance is circuitry". Final image reweights "magnetized night" as non-literal answer to visibility quest without moralizing. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sense memory strongest when ordinary falters"); rhythmic control shifts during blackout ("blue pre-morning gloom bled..."). Near-flawless under pressure though "sapphire hush" repetition slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulse fluttered like a moth against dusty glass" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for verbatim "sapphire hush" repetition in final paragraph dulling closure resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through sensory specificity (cardamom paste on knuckles, copper wire charge). "Remembrance is circuitry" synthesizes tech/memory uniquely; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
