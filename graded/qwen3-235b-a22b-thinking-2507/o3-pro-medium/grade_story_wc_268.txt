<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysar's "regally unpretentious" trait manifests concretely in micro-choices like fading between pillars; Selestine's quiet fervor for truth drives smuggling the ink pellet. Closure earns cost through Lysar's vanishing—no diagnostic labels, only embodied consequence as "dawn dripped through broken windows."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation anchors instantly in blue-dust temple. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): shattered mirrors reconfigure reality with conceptual cost as "all shards excluded the pretender." Lens holds Hybrid (accumulative pressure → causal sundering), cost legible in his vanishing stare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet functions as micro-setting—constrains choices by cracking like "dark seed" in scrolls, then blooming on mirror glass. Charges final image as the sundering catalyst; recurring object's physical properties (pellet→stain→rune) shape every key beat toward closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Lysar/Selestine amplify messages → smuggle pellet → sunder reflections. Cost unmistakable in "pretender stared at his own vanishing" and Lysar's fade. Tightening forecloses deception path with conceptual price paid on-page at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "crowns are only lenses" speech reframes legitimacy without moralizing. Final image (shards excluding pretender) offers non-literal answer to "what is truth?"—conceptual cost legible as court kneels "in self-preservation," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "silence became a weight" filters library through Lysar's presence. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in mirror speech ("truth bends space... kingdoms resemble funhouse corridors"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during sundering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rune of drift bloomed across proclamation" does triple duty (object, metaphor, stakes). Sentence rhythm varies from hushed ("dust like incense") to explosive ("sundering every reflection"). Final line "dawn dripped through broken windows" recharges opening dusk with closure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cognitive "rune of drift" weaponizes library scholarship against tyranny. Avoids tropes via shepherd heir reveal and "graceful collapse" tone. Risk-taking with Accumulative/Textural structure heightens stakes—removing the rune would break logic, yet specificity (ink pellet physics) grounds novelty.</comment>
