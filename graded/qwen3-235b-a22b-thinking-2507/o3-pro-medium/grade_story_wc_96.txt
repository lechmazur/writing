<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (Mira's "voice thin as spiderwebs," Rook scattering seed packets), avoiding labels. Contradictory impulses—fear vs rebuilding—drive micro-choices under sirens' threat. Slight underdevelopment of Mira's prison-to-freedom motivation limits final stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "two architects of luminous fracture smiling at the bloom" crystallizes resistance with conceptual cost (sirens, ex-inmate numbers). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (moth wings, rattling tin) reweighting "fracture" into hope. Orientation flawless by word 20.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library actively constrains choices: sagging beams require dictionary shoring, bullet holes channel light for growth. The coffee tin’s false bottom charges closure as "seed packets of words" literally rebuild the structure. Environment shapes tactics and final image ("windows regrew panes like fish scales").</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Rook’s word-seed scattering deepens pressure as sirens approach, narrowing options to collective action. Dominant stake (rebuilding with words vs. silent oppression) tightens through sensory accumulation ("murmuring shelves," "tide" of people), with visible cost in parole numbers stamped on library cards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "blooming resistance" reweights "luminous fracture" from broken glass to fertile vines without moralizing. Final image ("bloom") offers non-literal answer to "forge beauty from anarchy," avoiding thematic echo by tying growth to physical rebuilding and collective imagination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Rook’s "cartographer of cracks" lens filters details ("beams let in silver light"), while Mira notices "streetlights like dying guards." Rhythmic control under pressure—"moth wings ticking like minute hands"—teaches pattern early. Dialogue subtext ("stability masquerading as wreckage") carries goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("rattling like a cage full of pennies and promises"). Figurative language serves pressure: "floorboards brittle thickened into planks" shows transformation without telling. Final image’s "luminous fracture" payoff avoids muddle through earned recurrence. Closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "rebuilding" trope via specific mechanics: word-seed packets pry rot into green punctuation. "Penny poet" concept avoids quirkiness by tying molting to tangible stakes (false-bottom tin enabling resistance). Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—"blooming resistance" feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
