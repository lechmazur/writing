<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "coughed it aside" micro-choice; sentimental flaw drives drought reversal with visible cost ("rain drown reputation"). Fyodor's wet eyes crystallize mutual compromise without dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: rain begins as chick sings, cost legible in "reputation" sacrifice and "investors cursed." Hybrid lens holds—causal drought reversal meets accumulative salt-map erosion. "Approving" thunder slightly over-signals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as micro-setting: cracks guide navigation, erase map under rain, and mirror egg fissure. "Ground bone" specificity charges final release. Environment actively constrains choices from first line.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake tightening when Fyodor's throat-clearing forces drought cost confrontation. Agency-driven escalation via satellite orders ("dismantle siphons") with conceptual cost ("reputation"). Rain's arrival makes drought reversal visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme crystallizes through "reversing the direction of debt" action, not statement. Final image of erased map lines reweights "routes meant to disappear" without moralizing. "Scouring salt" honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "bruised purple" parasol, "damp cerulean" chick. Rhythmic control peaks in "timid thunder echo swallowed by dust." Zero filter verbs; Fyodor's silence speaks louder than Serafina's vows.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "refrigerated hope" compresses backstory without telling. "Salt powdered air like ground bone" avoids cliché through visceral specificity. Minor deduction for "approving" thunder anthropomorphism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "drought" trope into moral mechanism: manufactured scarcity enabling redemption. Salt flat's cracking map as organic guide (not forced symbol) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes.</comment>
