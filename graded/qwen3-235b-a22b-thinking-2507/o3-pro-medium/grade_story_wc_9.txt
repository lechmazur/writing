<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "willingly perplexed" state and memory surrender; father's sudden appearance lacks causal buildup despite strong embodied emotion in tracing hands scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with cost: memories poured into hourglass reconfigure time's rules; "clocks crumbling to dew" crystallizes stakes under Accumulative lens held since midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracked saucer constrains every key choice—memory surrender, father's return—and charges the final wildflowers; "choking beauty" motif evolves from moonlight to petal scent without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes intensify through memory accumulation in saucer, but "lost time settles where forgiveness is heavier than guilt" lacks visceral escalation; cost (surrendered memories) charges the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through saucer's reprise: "two overlapping palms" reweights time/loss without moralizing; avoids sentimentality via "clocks whose hands spun backward, digging trenches in the hours."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("obsidian rain," "bruised silk") remains consistent under stress; "wind in his throat" dialogue carries subtext without diagnostic labels; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor filter-verb cluster ("Mara felt the glade tilt") in high-pressure beat; otherwise zero loops with exceptional density—"porcelain crescent" and "damp with rainless thunder" show strategic specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-loss trope through cartomancer's ink and saucer physics; "choking beauty" risks purple prose but gains freshness via tactile stakes ("knees softened, but her father steadied her").</comment>
