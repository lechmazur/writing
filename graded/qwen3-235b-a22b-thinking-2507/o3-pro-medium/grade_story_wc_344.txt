<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "locks rushed, doors slammed" reflection versus current repair epiphany; micro-choice of apology to mirror earns closure. Slight over-tidiness in emotional progression limits 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when pendulum swings: "repair was less about fixing... inviting what was stilled to breathe again" with visible cost in thawing tears. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice mirrors constrain choice (apology unlocks heart) and charge final image ("footsteps keeping time"). Gear assortment functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory specificity in "frostbitten leather" volumes elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: prophecy fragments force gear assembly, then mirror apology reweights repair concept. Cost legible in "tears warmed her cheeks" but escalation lacks one tangible trade-off (e.g., gear sacrifice) for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "mechanical rose" assembly and final rhythm realization. Avoids moralizing; "locks as promises" reframing reweights premise with conceptual cost. Nailed Q5 9+ test via resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in locksmith's gear-focused noticing ("cog promised secret rhythm"). Rhythmic control peaks during clock assembly ("petals ticking, stems clicking"). Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing limits 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "breath ghosting like pale ribbons" shows strategic telling. Minor scaffold in "memories bobbed up like driftwood" (redundant with later "driftwood nostalgia") prevents 8.8+. Figurative language never dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "library quest" trope through lunar-locksmith specificity and repair-as-breathing philosophy. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "mechanical rose" synthesis feels inevitable. Fresh inflection in gear-to-heart alchemy.</comment>
