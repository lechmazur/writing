<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ellan’s interior contradiction ("meekness had been muscle") manifests through concrete micro-choices like studying debris with "deliberate patience" and surrendering his father’s laugh. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak; cost of traded memories charges closure. Minor deduction for secondary characters’ underdevelopment within scope limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis via "meekness had been muscle" realization with undeniable cost: surrendered memories powering the humming arches. Causal lens holds throughout; "vowed to guard borrowed forgettings" crystallizes the trade-off. Final image reconfigures the opening "bruised apricot" sun with earned hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: floating arches cause disaster AND become silk anchors, while lom blossoms and meteoric glass veins drive action. "Bruises wrapped in luminous gauze" charges closure by reweighting the initial "bruised apricot" sun. Micro-setting (mine shafts, silk) directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience vs. despair) tightens causally: Ellan’s memory trade enables communal sacrifice, foreclosing passivity when "skepticism cracked." Escalation driven by agency—villagers volunteering losses—makes cost unmistakable: elder relinquishing "daughter’s final fever" literally strengthens the silk. Single meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bartered awakenings" as lived practice, not statement. Final image ("bartered its nightmares for dawn") resonates non-literally with prior memory trades, avoiding sentimentality. Complexity shines in communal forgetting as resilience—no false equivalence, just earned wisdom from concrete acts like trading fever dreams for strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "shadows resembled instructions," "dusk soaked arches in violet wine." Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for panic ("Panic fluttered"), lyrical flow for reflection. Zero head-hopping; compression ("journey unfolded during an hour hanging between...") taught early and paid off in closure’s "borrowed forgettings."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; every line advances story ("broken winches dangled, rattling prayers" sets mood, foreshadows). Figurative language serves pressure: "panic fluttered" mirrors later humming arches. Minor deduction: "bartered awakenings" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete payoff ("faint chimes" of traded memories).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific, grounded choices: "meek hero" gains depth through blacksmith’s quiet craft; resilience built on communal forgetting, not remembering. Fresh inflection in memory-for-strength economy. Avoids safety middle—cost is tangible (surrendered laughter), yet emotional truth prevents gimmickry.</comment>
