<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's contradictory impulses (caution vs. need to understand grief) manifest in micro-choices like trembling with the vial. Seraphae's parallel confession about orchids creates authentic mirroring, but her arc lacks sufficient testing under pressure to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the fern's vapor triggers memory reconfiguration where "tears fell, yet within them glimmered warmth" makes cost visible. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the irrevocable transformation completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial (micro-setting) actively constrains choice and charges closure when unstopped post-acceptance. Lantern moss's color shift ("crimson to coral") physically manifests emotional change, satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as fern veins clear: Lysander's agency in inhaling the vapor despite caution creates irreversible change. Cost is visceral in the cottage memory's physicality ("shattered lanterns, mother coughing"), though Seraphae's parallel journey lacks equal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "grief kept love from vanishing" isn't stated but shown via tears that "glimmered warmth." Final image ("world smelled of possibility") reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in scent/light observations ("lanterns stored light the way lungs stored air"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("He had blamed the scent ever since...") while Seraphae's dialogue reveals character through specific detail (gloves glowing under UV rod).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm with zero loops; "molten opal" vapor and moss color shifts advance atmosphere. Minor deduction for "tears fell, yet within them glimmered warmth" bordering abstraction, though anchored by lantern imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis reframes grief through scent-memory mechanics. Risk-taking in making scent the primary conflict driver pays off via fern's vapor, with "crystal shadows" motif transforming from setting to conceptual framework without gimmickry.</comment>
