<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: Marlin mocks his quest while hope "prickles his ribs," Adra's vulnerability (reciting lost books) crystallizes under pressure. Final renunciation of the brooch feels earned through embodied choices, not therapy-speak. Slight deduction as motivations align too neatly early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—the sealed fissure and "relieved silence" reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost (sacrificed brooch, new covenant with remembering). Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens holds through plankton intensification. Cost legible in the resin smear and spiral painting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal island micro-setting constrains every choice: rain trails guide movement, tide erases footprints, chapel's brine column emerges from eroded cliffs. The amber brooch's droplets charge the final image ("Water remembers who listens"), meeting 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy masterfully reflects urgency—plankton pools glow brighter as stakes rise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: Adra's recited book titles and Marlin's painting deepen the plankton's glow, forcing the brine column's emergence. Cost unmistakable—brooch sacrificed, but "uneasy wonder" replaces certainty. Stakes tighten under accumulative lens as vulnerability becomes the only currency the island accepts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: droplets as "worlds upon worlds," Adra rebuilding archives as "gardens where stories root in silt." Final line "Water remembers who listens" reweights the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—insight arises from Marlin's painted spiral, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: painter's eye ("colors leaked... like summoned ghosts") vs. archivist's precision ("titles of destroyed books"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short staccato sentences during tremors ("The building trembled") contrast lyrical cadence elsewhere. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as droplets surface memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through layered verbs ("threading," "threshing," "re-knitting"). Final line’s "wryly earnest" echo is intentional lyric payoff, not repetition. One minor deduction: "haggard awe" appears twice without sufficient variation, slightly dulling climax intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific synthesis: "threshing meaning" from insomnia, water as memory-keeper. Emotional truth in Marlin’s curse-to-covenant shift avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—the brooch’s droplets make conceptual cost visceral.</comment>
