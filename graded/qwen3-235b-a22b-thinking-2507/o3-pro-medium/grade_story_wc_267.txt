<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (Ellis weighing duty against hope while twisting the bolt), but Mara's motivation relies on exposition ("Rumor says") rather than embodied conflict. The closure choice earns visible cost through thawing pipes and changed silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density shift at the bolt twist; cost is legible in "walls shuddered... hush deeper than law." Midpoint lens naming barely clears the 8.8 gate, but the earned stasis closure ("safety need not imprison sound") reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress actively constrains choice (silence law) and charges the final image ("snow kept falling, but flakes drifted slower"). Frostbitten objects (piano bolt, bandages) become micro-settings that physically shape Ellis's pivotal action and Mara's tactile search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as Ellis confronts the "unpardonable silence" law, with cost made visible in the thawing pipes and altered snowfall. The single tightening (bolt removal) narrows options under Accumulative pressure, though Mara's backstory could heighten moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the piano bolt's transformation—from rumored artifact to catalyst for redefined safety—without moralizing. The final image ("frostbitten hope no longer begged; it remained") resonates as a non-literal answer to the cost-of-safety question, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost still whispered," "breathing travelers") persists under pressure with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing is voice-motivated, and the patterned elision (silent dialogue via paper) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density with "steam hissed from vents, thawing pipes, knitting the fortress's nerves" doing triple duty. Slight overwriting risk in "seraphically mundane patterns of clouds and groceries" is mitigated by its charged payoff in the final smile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms silence tropes through the bolt's physicality and "frostbitten hope" specificity. The synthesis feels inevitable—Ellis's quest to "understand the cost of safety" crystallizing via tactile action rather than epiphany—while the cobalt motif avoids cliché through consistent sensory integration.</comment>
