<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation for seeking "unused courage" remains abstract despite poetic embodiment; Lis's internal contradiction lacks concrete stakes manifestation beyond the symbolic ridge clearing, slightly weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the lantern's ignition representing courage claimed; the cost—vulnerability in claiming what "waits where leashes empty"—is legible in the filament's "hush" and Lis's "warmth pool[ing] under ribs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern (micro-setting) constrains choice by requiring fear to "step aside" for light, directly charging the climax; its placement among rusted chains transforms it from object to embodied courage, reweighting the final descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lis's agency in following "echoes" and kneeling at the ridge, but the dominant "unused courage" conflict lacks visceral escalation; the cost feels conceptual rather than tangible until the lantern ignites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ridge clearing's "scattered collars" and the lantern's delayed glow, rejecting tidy morals; the final image of "new constellations blossom[ing] inside the punched stars" offers resonant, non-literal resolution to the courage quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals of fog," "damp vellum") persists under pressure; rhythmic control tightens during Lis's climb ("path forked and reforked, every choice a whisper"), with elision (minimal backstory) taught early and paid off in the ridge revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("shoreline lullaby," "damp vellum") slightly muddles immediacy; no loops, but dense figuration risks overshadowing Lis's physical struggle during the climb's critical tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry guides as "doorkeepers of dream" transforms archetypal mentors; specificity of "star stamp ticket punch" and "rusting chains" grounds abstract courage in tangible ridgeway logic, avoiding thematic generality.</comment>
