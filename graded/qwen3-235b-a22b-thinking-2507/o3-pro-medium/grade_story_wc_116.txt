<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("could ascend... but oath tugged") crystallize at riverbank with visible cost in "heart unspoken"; flaw (passive witness) compounds throughout without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via "heart unspoken" line showing forfeiture cost; Accumulative lens holds as river rising reweights witnessing stakes through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge constrains choice (burrowing enables neutrality) and charges final image ("thrummed inside my bones"); micro-setting (swan paper) evolves from map to boat with causal weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("reality slip," "mind grips loosely") creates distinct rhythm; compression ("seasons lost names") taught early pays off in closure's "failing sky" with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pages crisp with mildew" exemplifies high-density concrete language; final line "heart unspoken" achieves propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms witnessing trope through "regenerative silence" concept; obsidian refuge as silence-womb synthesizes theme/setting with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
