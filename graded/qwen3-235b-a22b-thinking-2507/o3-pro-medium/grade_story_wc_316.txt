<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("memories muffled like distant drums") and flaws drive choices, but clones lack individuation beyond assigned traits. "Slices through pretense" appears only as dialogue label without embodied cost, weakening secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost: clones dissolving into orchids/rain while Mara accepts shared personhood ("custody was never ownership"). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic synchronization climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brain jar constrains the climax—Mara's synchronization with its pulse directly triggers memory integration. Final image charges it as Mara offers it to the lake, illuminating water "like moonlight beneath skin" to reweight personhood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One meaningful deepening shifts conflict from verbal argument to rhythmic synchronization under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible (clones dissolving mid-reach), but escalation lacks narrowing options—pressure intensifies through density, not causal stakes transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("threading emptiness with colored yarn"), not abstraction. Final image reweights premise: marble sisters "kneeling, acknowledging custody was never ownership" offers resonant non-literal answer to personhood without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured air currents," "history rewrites itself") modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythmic control peaks in synchronization scene ("breathed opposite to first clone's inhale"), with multi-POV cleanly sectioned and ending lens stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("tears landed as seeds that sprouted tiny sculptures"). Minor deduction: "crimson fluid glimmered" slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat, but justified by POV's poetic lens without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope via "complementary opposites" mechanism where emotional integration—not combat—resolves custody. Risk-taking (cosmic stakes) heightens specificity: "relief after first thunder" grounds universality in visceral detail.</comment>
