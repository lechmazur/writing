<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Briony puzzles over 'emerges transformed' against scientific training; her micro-choice to follow the leaf crystallizes values with visible cost in the monuments' transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Briony's return to sorting while carrying the seed's promise reconfigures her ordinary work into sacred duty, with the 'tender weight of destiny' making cost undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonstone dust specks constrain choices (trading riddles, pressing into soil) and charge the final image as candleflowers sprout; cloudwood plank and pollen-bells directly shape the staircase ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the silver leaf's verse forces Briony to abandon cataloging for the arbor's heart; the cost—her entire worldview shifting—is legible in 'felt weight of destiny' as she resumes work with transformed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'tiny monuments': the final candleflowers sprouting from Briony's monuments reweight forgotten things as living legacy, avoiding moralizing while resonating with the 'emerges transformed' core without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—Briony notices 'glyphs etched in chlorophyll' and 'pollen that chimed,' reflecting her seed-sorter focus; rhythm modulates from patient lichen-like pacing to urgent spiraling fronds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but 'veined scrap that fluttered past her spectacles' slightly overwrites; density remains high though a single mixed metaphor ('swirling mist' as islands then 'leaflight') barely dims peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenuity transforms folklore into tactile stakes: moonstone specks remembering moon phases aren't magical MacGuffins but tools shaping Briony's cataloging ritual, making 'mossy delight' feel earned rather than whimsical.</comment>
