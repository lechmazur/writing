<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during peak pressure; avalanche vision shows embodied cost but no competing urge to stop. Micro-choice to speak the town's death year reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "heartbeat sounded like distant shovels" crystallizes absorbed sorrow. Accumulative lens holds as prism density reweights time's texture; cost proof explicit in physical sensation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bonsai forest micro-setting constrains choices and charges climax: "trunks thickened... split beneath invisible snowdrifts" when Calix speaks avalanche year. Sensory details reflect urgency through filament hum and soil scattering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation tightens through prism's "hungry" pulse, narrowing options to archival endurance. Cost unmistakable as Calix absorbs future grief; single deepening suffices for length with felt stakes in heartbeat metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: "history was not a river but a loom" reweights time without moralizing. Final image of "luminous threads" offers resonant answer to textural collection through Calix's archival courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "thunder butterflies" compass and "auricular alchemy"; rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses during avalanche vision. No head-hopping; voice modulates from incandescent restraint to convulsed ink.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "lamp brightened, refracting grief into frostbitten blues" does triple duty. Minor repetition of "incandescent restraint" avoids scaffold by charging final smile. Propulsion flawless through cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-smithing via fluorescent hum transforms archival trope. Emotional specificity in "textures clocks envy" avoids abstraction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry through bonsai's temporal reactions.</comment>
