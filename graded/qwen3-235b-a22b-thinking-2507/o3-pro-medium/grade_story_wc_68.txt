<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation is clear but interior contradiction lacks embodied tension; his "abrasive calm" shift to "trembled" doubt lacks visceral physicality. Mara's limited on-page presence constrains relationship depth despite strong voice distinction in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (surrendering absolute truth claims), but "custodians" resolution slightly softens the felt price. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sedimentary pattern accumulation to star-chart reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken city actively constrains choices: rusted ladders "arguing with gravity," lotus-choked lagoon navigation. Final image of "dawn seeping through tide pools" charges closure by mirroring earlier "algae-filtered dusk," making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when descent forces collaboration, narrowing options from solitary quest to shared custody. Conceptual cost (abandoning narrative purity) is legible but slightly abstract; physical constraints like mud-choked stairs deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sextant projection reweights "competing narratives" without moralizing. Final line’s "newer, sturdier narratives" offers resonant answer to truth-vs-story question via earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barnacles and the occasional lost rat," "ticking silently in imagination") persists under pressure. Dialogue subtext ("shards meaningful only within narrative") avoids ventriloquism while modulating voice for emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tide patterns scribed lines of salt" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. One minor register drift: "rationally rebellious" slightly label-y but redeemed by immediate action ("sanding down certainties").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via sedimentary truth-seeking; "chronometer in gutters" premise feels inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, but "custodians" resolution lacks bold risk-taking in final image.</comment>
