<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete details (clipboard mirror, margin notes) but lacks deeper contradictory impulses in final beat; archivist's motivation crystallizes through chalk ritual though secondary pressure remains underexplored within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mirielle's storm drain sketch crystallizes vocation shift with undeniable cost ("molten gold cooling into typeface"); Accumulative lens holds through glyph-writing density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden arcade constrains choices actively: dawn light enables UV glyphs, storm drain becomes final canvas; "bakery steam/ozone" sensory blend charges closure by reweighting "futuristic nostalgia" into purposeful action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from preserving names to sheltering "sentiments"; archivist's "last letter" forces Mirielle's agency shift with felt cost ("emptied now of destination"), though external pressure could intensify earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through obsolete emoticons as archival keys; final line reweights "margins" into active hope without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing through concrete action (chalk on pavement).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterful ("fragrance of futuristic nostalgia", "joints popping like fireworks"); lyric compression serves Accumulative lens without scaffold, though one template cadence ("He [verb]...") appears mid-scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or figurative muddle; "mapped a letter to a hue unborn" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line's specificity ("storm drain") avoids sentimentality, though minor nominalization ("realization") appears pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surface mail as "slow poetry" transforms courier trope; obsolete emoticons as archival keys feel inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk in making chalk the central metaphor pays off thematically without gimmickry.</comment>
