<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aikan's curse (visions cracking today) and eel lullabies steadying hands, but "hemispheres of the soul" epiphany risks abstraction without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with friction's return, but the eels' sudden prime-number speech feels convenient rather than causally earned by prior ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal bluff's absence of friction actively constrains stone placement and anchors the final image ("grooves that would remain"), making setting indispensable to the closure's physical cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly through stone misalignment risks, yet the dust's mid-ritual vibration guiding Aikan weakens protagonist agency by introducing near-coincidental resolution pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from "patterns understood, promise kept" without moralizing, though "migration map across hemispheres of the soul" slightly over-intellectualizes the earned covenant revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("footfalls unheard because friction disappeared") thrives, but eels speaking "prime numbers that blossomed into vowels" jars with Aikan's embodied voice in peak ritual tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose soars with "tears drifted... orbiting cheeks like small moons," yet stacked metaphors ("luminous columns that wrote sentences across clouds") create density friction in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Radical synthesis of eel migration as sacred geometry feels inevitable, though "borrowed dawn" risks cliché despite strong contextual reweighting in the final grooves image.</comment>
