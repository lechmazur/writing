<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied action (tapping cedar planks as "decoding hidden alphabet"), but limited contradictory impulses weaken the 9+ gate. Final choice to sing feels earned by prior causality, yet the vow to "interpret silence as possibility" lacks sufficient friction until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the angel's return refracts silence into possibility with conceptual cost (her prior fall from legend). However, the spiral stair's unmotivated appearance creates a minor causality break in the Accumulative lens dominant at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind bells function as micro-setting that charges the final image (clashing "with orchestral clarity"), while the halo fragment constrains Marlo's pivotal action. Mineral-coated stalactites evolve causally with the water ritual, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through Marlo's agency: singing mends the halo, directly narrowing options from vacancy to possibility. Cost is unmistakable in the angel's "eyes [as] two questions" and her prior fall from legend, reweighting silence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (wood waiting for nails/halo waiting for song), avoiding moralizing. Final image—"promise turns like a well-balanced wheel"—offers non-literal resolution, but the vow's abstract phrasing slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metal whispers like mica light") and rhythmic control under pressure ("notes skate along chrome rails") shine. Voice modulates perfectly from "rusty" singing to "varnish warming under sun," with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("coax gears to twitch"), but "varnish warming under sun" creates a mixed metaphor in the climax that slightly dulls closure's sonic charge. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully with scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes carousel mechanics with legend restoration through specific detail (mineral sequins, copper pipe chimes). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "misting hush" edges toward atmospheric cliché despite functional use.</comment>
