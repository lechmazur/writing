<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("routes vs destinations") earned through concrete mapping actions and the confession slip; embodied tremors and spine-tingles avoid therapy-speak, though "analytically artistic vision" borders on label abstraction early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("Destinations pretend too") under Accumulative/Textural lens; spatial anchors by line 4 avoid orientation penalty while disorientation serves the vault's mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pavement cracks constrain choices (guiding spiral mapping) and charge the final image (arrows inverting); mist-parting rails and phantom punch make environment tactically essential to closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as pavement arrows escalate to constellations; the "routes vs destinations" trade-off forecloses deception with visceral cost (gloved hand trembling while writing truth).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final line reweights the central question through cartography ("mapped within the heart") without moralizing; the ticket punch's "Destinations pretend too" delivers non-literal thematic answer via earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("arrows stitched like conspiratorial breadcrumbs") with rhythmic control under pressure; "mist coiled within, turning moonlight into trembling silk" modulates texture to mirror emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold with high density ("invisible passes crossing darkness"); "phantom punch glowed anemic blue" avoids figurative muddle while advancing plot, though "analytically artistic vision" slightly overwrites early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through cartographer's lens (pavement cracks as map); fresh inflection via "destinations pretend too" reconfiguration grows from established route obsession, though magical library concept lacks full novelty.</comment>
