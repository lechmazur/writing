<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "confidently uncertain" state and the pivotal choice to listen rather than rewrite, earned by the vision of past failure. Minor abstraction in "understood their ache" slightly dilutes embodied emotion during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly under Accumulative/Textural lens: retirement of the pen and "gently weighted peace" foreclose rewriting with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dried-up pen functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("packed the pen... drifted into spiraling moons"), constraining choices from ink extraction to retirement. Basalt's "colder" disapproval evolves causally with edits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: questioning "Was I truly helping?" deepens stakes, leading to the vision that forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in the pen's retirement and "gently weighted peace" after refusal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete editing acts ("inserted a single pause before 'burned'"), culminating in the final image of the anomaly closing "like a well-placed comma"—a resonant non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moons corkscrewed like distracted bees") and rhythmic control peak in the pen's "shivered, clearing its throat" moment. Voice modulates perfectly from clinical precision to lyrical vulnerability under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ruby filament" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight repetition of "confidently uncertain" (3x) barely registers as intentional refrain rather than artifact, preserving propulsion to the sublime final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms editing trope through celestial context: "commas of existence" redefines historical intervention. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "thresh meaning from experience" feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
