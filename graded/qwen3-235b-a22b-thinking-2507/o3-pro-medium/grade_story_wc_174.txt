<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "uncommonly serene" trait remains untested under pressure. Motivation for ethical storytelling stays abstract without showing personal stakes or risk, weakening the final choice's earned quality despite coherent external actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Silas' departure with meteors "braiding silver thread" crystallizes options (continuing his mission) with felt cost (scholars' complicity and chastened state). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, and cost legibility in "sting of complicity graze their throats" anchors the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Campfire story stick constrains choices and charges closure—it's planted as a mast, reverses the miner's tale, and taps against Silas' leg during departure. Recurring meteors evolve from "hush" to "braided silver thread," reweighting the theme through environmental pressure on the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation lacks protagonist cost: Silas' method succeeds flawlessly at each bar, with no personal risk or trade-off. The dominant stake (ethical storytelling) tightens through audience reactions but misses a visible price paid by Silas himself, diluting the pressure despite strong external consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the miner parable's reversal makes "half-lit epiphanies" visceral. Final image of meteors braiding silver thread reweights "meteor hush" into hopeful continuity, offering a non-literal answer to ethical storytelling without moralizing, perfectly avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "moths drifted like ash" and "candle's light slip behind his hand," with rhythmic control during puppet shows. No head-hopping; compression of bar-hopping sequence taught early and paid off in the dome confrontation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "ghost laughter" and three repetitions of "meteor hush" slightly muddle peak beats. Otherwise impeccable propulsion: "gasps scattered like dice" and "tide pool at midnight" achieve high density without scaffold, though one paraphrase loop ("rehearsing a reversal"/"reverse their poison") triggers −0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer exploring ethical storytelling through tactile objects (rice paper sails, puppets) avoids tropes. "Half-lit epiphanies" as a core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking in subverting bar entertainment—though the serene protagonist archetype lacks sufficient transformation.</comment>
