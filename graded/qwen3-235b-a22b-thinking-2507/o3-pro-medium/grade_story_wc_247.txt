<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: "twin hearts" metaphor embodies contradictory impulses; micro-choices like bolder signing under pressure. Weakness: "joyful sorrow" label risks therapy-speak, nearly triggering -0.5 penalty; Harlan lacks internal conflict to test Mara's motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density escalation (12 hushes → color-music). Cost proof clear in "Harlan fade as dawn unwound." Non-closure cap applies: two distinct issues (excessive reflection on "map," convenient Harlan dissolution).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor functions as micro-setting: tide enables glyph-tracing, luminosity charges final "promise," and water's resonance directly constrains the climax. Camera's filmless state alters tactics throughout, meeting 9+ gate requirement for tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake escalation driven by Mara's agency (photographing 12 hushes), with visible cost in Harlan's dissolution. But "when no one remembers you" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure—it's atmospheric rather than tightening decisions per band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "sign language written in pauses" becomes literal color-music. Final image reweights silence as generative without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Harlan's "map in every pause" feels earned through prior glyph-tracing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "invisible glyphs," "inaudible portraits." Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("patient lantern") to urgent ("tapping wooden posts"). Minor flaw: "twin hearts" metaphor slightly strains under pressure without full character-specific grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "Violins... quivered faintly, as if hearing distant footsteps" does triple duty. But "joyful sorrow" repetition creates a paraphrase loop (-0.2), and "twin hearts" borders on cliché in high-pressure beat (-0.3).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sign language as literal music notation avoids magical realism tropes. Risk-taking (silence as active force) heightens stakes—color-music payoff grows organically from "nocturnal lilies" vision. +0.3 risk distinction for unconventional coherence.</comment>
