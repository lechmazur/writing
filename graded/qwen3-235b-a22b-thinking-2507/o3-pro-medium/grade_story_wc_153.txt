<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically ("fierce tenderness burning behind her ribs") and through simultaneous impulses (fearing/longing for the apology). Micro-choices like pressing the shard to cracked skin reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, with the final apology earned by embodied causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "glowing seam now pulsed, proof she heals in moonlight when truth is spoken." Accumulative lens holds throughout, with pressure tightening via sensory density ("roots tightening like a question") toward crystallization where the cost is legible in the physical seam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard (micro-setting) constrains choices from sternum press to overflow, charging the final image as it "cooled against her heart, empty now." Mangrove roots actively pressure movement ("corridors tightening like a question"), with algae-slick trunks evoking irreversible childhood choices that shape present tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Eline's agency under Accumulative lens: wading deeper when spirits' counterpoint ("Wait" vs "Speak now") narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in "armor rusted into flakes" and the compassion flood that reconfigures the wound, with moonlight's late arrival forcing her to "carry the sting" until truth crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: unsent letters become "liquid words" on bark, silence "inheriting the wound." Final image ("moon blazed like a mailed letter") reweights the central paralysis question without moralizing, showing mutual hesitation as shared burden rather than abandonment through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notes trembled like wet glass," "breaths into blank envelopes") modulates rhythm under pressure—lyrical cadence fractures into raw fragments during the apology spill. Psychic distance shifts intentionally when memories surface, with compression taught early ("braille for the living") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density where every phrase advances atmosphere or character ("moss inside her mouth" compressing emotional decay). Minor deduction for "coppery dusk" (slight overwriting in high-pressure beat), but no figurative muddle—rhythm varies naturally from "mist glazed the air" to the staccato "Conflicted, Eline waded deeper."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis: mangroves as "corridors" for emotional paralysis, shard as "mouthpiece" for shared burden. Fresh inflection in "liquid punctuation" and "reddish snow" rust—avoids generality while risking lyric structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with moon-as-letter reconfiguring silence as song.</comment>
