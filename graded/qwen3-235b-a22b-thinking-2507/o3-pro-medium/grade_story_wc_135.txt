<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction despite strong embodied emotion; Karima's "reactively visionary" trait drives micro-choices (spacing recollections) but lacks visible flaw-complication at climax. "Hearten the city" renunciation earns closure but misses contradictory impulse in final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dented valve mapping departures), but cost proof lacks visceral specificity; "battered clouds" image charges final stance under Accumulative lens. Orientation solid by 120 words with harbor anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trumpet valve functions as indispensable micro-setting: constrains methodology ("staggered intervals"), charges closure via wind-resonance, and reweights exile cost. Harbor's "tide-mark room" directly alters Karima's nightly actions with tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstructing fragmented memories) tightens through Karima's agency as councilors contribute fragments, narrowing options to "lattice" construction. Cost is conceptual (irreparable "holes" in recollection) but slightly abstract for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions ("patch the wind" with sensory fragments), not moralizing. Final image ("quiet return of notes no ear could own") reweights "navigated absences" without stated moral, avoiding thematic echo despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measuring heartbeat through bell chimes") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "reactively visionary" label slightly disrupts archivist lexicon in high-stakes beat. Dialogue subtext ("holes blowing through recollection") carries earned weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "staggered intervals" repetition (Q6) reduces propulsion; "hearten" recurs without syntactic variation. High density maintained but scaffold appears in thematic summary ("my craft was to patch the wind"). No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-memory-weaver transforms exile trope through sensory specificity (kelp fires, plum brine). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "reactively visionary" borders on thematic convenience without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
