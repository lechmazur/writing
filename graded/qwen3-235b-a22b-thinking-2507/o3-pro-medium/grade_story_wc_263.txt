<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract during pivotal sacrifice ("fear fluttered"); lacks concrete embodiment of contradiction between saving village and losing self. Micro-choices under exhaustion lack specificity despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "lighter and emptied" state crystallizes stakes after surrendering stardust. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; density increase ("seasons blurred; snowmelt swelled...") tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bronze heart instrument constrains every choice and charges the final image as "glowing from surrendered speck." Frost-laced lichen where he rests becomes the closure's snowbed, transforming setting into embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: "sidereal fatigue" calendar deepens stakes through physical deterioration ("flurries needled cheeks raw"). Cost legible when stardust surrender creates "silver cloud," altering Ilya's state irreversibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of stars "lingering like grateful witnesses" reweights creativity's cost without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete sacrifice (breathing out stardust) rather than abstract statement, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("tasted of remembered stardust"), but "shadowed rapture" phrasing slightly drifts into elevated diction during climax. Rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional despite minor register tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "sweet ache that blurred horizon and heartbeat" slightly overwrites the rest beat. Propulsion never stalls, yet "moth wings desperate for moonlight" simile borders on ornamental density in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "creative block" trope through tactile specificity (iron vines on quill, liquid-light glyphs). Unwritten calendar concept feels inevitable yet fresh, resisting abstraction with "feelings of sidereal fatigue" as timekeeping.</comment>
