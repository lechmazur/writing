<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara's silent navigation versus risky truce violation; embodied urgency via watch fob's "ticking narrower" timeline. Cinder Pike lacks sufficient on-page pressure to fully test relationship dynamics despite status shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Clara captures the "crack of ruptured faith" in memory, with cost legible in "heart hammering comforting unease." Sunrise timing creates inevitable pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens, though Reef's abrupt cylinder handoff slightly softens climax causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rotting pier functions as active constraint: pilings enforce truce via "splinter offenders into flotsam," barnacles become weapons during climax. Watch fob transcends ornament to charge the final vow ("never open it again") with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Clara's agency—"Truce" spoken to revive silence—narrowing options after Cinder shatters the hush. Sunrise deadline tightens relentlessly, with visible cost in market's wrath (barnacles raining) forcing Clara's vocal gamble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sound of trust breaking" reframed from commodified wax cylinder to Clara's internal vow ("trust holding"). Avoids moralizing by making trust's fragility tangible via shattered silence and salvaged fob.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in marine lexicon ("brackish steam," "flotsam") and stress-compressed rhythm during climax. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction near end slightly dulls immediacy despite otherwise controlled focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crab shells and shattering silence" achieves triple duty (sensory/action/stakes) in high-pressure beat. One near-miss mixed metaphor ("harp's flawed string") saved by context but prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms pirate trope through sonic stakes ("contraband lullabies," trust as sound) and Accumulative tension. Risk-taking in climax—capturing rupture via memory not machine—feels inevitable through prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
