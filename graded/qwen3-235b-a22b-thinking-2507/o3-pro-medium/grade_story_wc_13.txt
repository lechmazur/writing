<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eira’s artistic yearning vs. understanding of societal cost, but climax lacks layered internal struggle during cage-breaking; micro-choices (pendant twist, charcoal dip) reveal values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "uninterrupted cadence that belonged only to freedom" crystallizes the cost (cracked stylus, giant’s movement) under Accumulative lens; cadence shift reweights time’s value with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop canals actively constrain choices (punt navigation, water corridor), while the stone giant’s nap functions as essential micro-setting; final image charges canals with transformed meaning through the freed echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively when Eira witnesses "lovers relived confessions," accepting societal cost; agency in drawing the cage line forecloses safe time manipulation, with visible trade-offs (emptied seconds, broken stylus).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "raw echo would end that commerce" avoids moralizing; final image reweights time’s purpose without stating a moral, embracing complexity through the illustrator’s sensory liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful ("soft as eraser crumbs," "canal a ribbon of ink"); syntax compresses under pressure ("Silence clapped shut like a sketchbook") while maintaining distinct illustrator’s lexicon and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; high density with propulsion ("water lifted the craft, and she pushed off"). One minor synonym loop ("borrowed seconds flooded... warm and granular, ready to be kneaded") avoids muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-manipulation tropes through concrete mechanics (borrowing from giant’s nap); "proto-echo" concept feels fresh with stakes rooted in illustrator’s sensory truth, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
