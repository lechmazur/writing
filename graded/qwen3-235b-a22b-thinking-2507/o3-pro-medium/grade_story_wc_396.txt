<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's embodied contradiction ("doubts curled like smoke inside conviction") and micro-choices under pressure elevate characterization, but Silas's sudden appearance lacks prior causality, weakening the bond's earned weight at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (sea recalibrating to their rhythm), but the stranger's unmotivated appearance violates Accumulative lens rules—coincidence resolves the central mystery rather than complicating it, undermining escalation integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shifting ice floes and crystal fragment actively constrain choices (e.g., floes dictating shed access), while the emotional map charges the final image—environment and tool jointly shape tactics and closure with exquisite specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency (deciphering map, descending shed), but Silas's convenient arrival undercuts pressure; the conceptual cost (anomaly as bond) lands cleanly, yet the resolution relies on coincidence rather than earned causality per Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through cartography ("map empathy onto action"), but "courageous anomaly was never a lone hero" borders on thematic echo—resonance is earned via the emotional map projection, though final insight risks over-articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fruit glowed like small lanterns") and rhythmic control under stress shine, with lyrical compression taught early; no POV slippage, though "cold awe fluttered" slightly drifts from Mara's embodied lexicon in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density elevate prose, but "snowflakes began, small at first, then swirling sheets" commits a simultaneity error (participle implies overlap where sequential action occurs), dulling the storm's causal pressure on descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotional cartography with ice-floe setting feels inevitable, yet the "courageous anomaly" trope risks familiarity; specificity of birch-bark map and mirror portals transforms conventions without gimmickry.</comment>
