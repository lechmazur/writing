<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in dealer’s "archivist of possibilities" self-perception versus profession; Celine’s embodied terror ("posture of someone privately terrified") and micro-choice to pay moon-bruise coins despite memory fog risk earn her transformation. Flaws drive stakes: her fear of breaking herself necessitates the blend, his detachment prevents becoming "merchandise."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: Celine’s "grief hides inside jokes" crystallizes insight with conceptual cost (dealer’s absorbed patience requiring detachment). Causal lens holds perfectly—"because/therefore" links tighten from half-truths to inhalation timing. Cost proof is explicit: "dealer must never become the merchandise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto actively constrains choices: resinous walls enable static electricity sensing, liquid amber pool triggers Celine’s motivation reveal. Charges closure via "mineral applause" (dripping) validating her insight while echoing opening imagery. Tool (copper prongs) dictates critical timing ("breathe only when aura cooled").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insight without heartbreak) escalates through protagonist agency: Celine’s vulnerability at amber pool → agreement to memory fog → high-stakes inhalation timing. Cost (memory fog + dealer’s lingering patience) visibly alters tactics (his precise tool-packing) and charges final image. Single tightening (violet-to-honey wait) narrows options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "half truths" as method (dealer’s distraction) and Celine’s evasion, answered by her grief/jokes paradox—no moralizing. Final image (night thickening as "listening to the static") resonates with emotional labor’s cost. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars: "vessels have limits that feelings love to overflow" earned through procedure physics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: dealer notices "microscopic oils fluttered like moth wings" while ignoring scent. Rhythm modulates perfectly—clinical during procedure ("coiled wires drank charged dusk") shifts to lyrical for transformation. "Affectionate detachment" tone deepens as he absorbs her patience, avoiding convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence does triple duty: "strands of hair lifting as invisible ions hummed" establishes physics/tension/intimacy. Final line "listening to the static" recharges opening motif with closure weight. Single justified flourish ("chromatic fumes waiting for adoption") fits dealer’s archivist voice without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "emotion dealer" trope via static electricity mechanics and grief/jokes insight. Risk-taking in making dealer the subtle protagonist pays off through his quiet realization. Avoids safety middle: amber grotto as organic metaphor (preserved emotion), not decorative. Emotional specificity ("silken patience") avoids generic templates.</comment>
