<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elaine's "tarnished wonder" duality and micro-choices like pressing the locust shell to her chest; Lio's sculptor-turned-rebel shift earns credibility through tactile detail (grease/chlorophyll hands). No diagnostic label-speak during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "beginnings are always born in tarnished wonder" crystallizes the cost (Elaine's impending treason) with conceptual weight. Hybrid lens holds—causal beats (violin notes → statue cracks) accumulate into textural transformation (sap replacing oil) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Elaine's climax choice ("flinging it into the orchard") and charging the final image ("resonantly soft afterring"). Orchards' copper roots ticking as clocks filter POV urgency into sensory hierarchy, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elaine's agency: her bow slicing "like a lantern carving tunnels" directly narrows options as statues lock/joints crack. Cost is unmistakable—"Elaine felt the bridge cables slacken... suspecting the kingdom would brand her traitor tomorrow"—reconfiguring beauty as dangerous action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "beauty had not merely been displayed; it had been decided" avoids moralizing by rooting insight in physical acts (sculptor's chisel, violin's iron purpose). Final image ("fresh wind tuned itself to the resonantly soft afterring") offers non-literal answer to "breaking free" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "polished locust shell dangling from the violin's scroll" and "marble eyes glittered whenever a leaf dared fall"—selective, biased noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during statue shrieks ("The statues tried to march, but their joints locked") contrast lyrical twilight openings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("viridian sap oozed where oil had been, scenting the air with long-forgotten spring" does triple duty). One near-miss: "tarnished wonder" recurrence risks echo but gains weight through earned context shifts from opening to closing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes via specific constraints: violin must mimic "dawn winds" and "gears grinding against rust" to bypass statue enforcement. Fresh inflection in "beauty had been decided"—synthesis of instrument, sculptor, and soil feels inevitable yet non-obvious, resisting abstraction.</comment>
