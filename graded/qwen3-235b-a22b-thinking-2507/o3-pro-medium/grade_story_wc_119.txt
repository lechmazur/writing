<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chest loosening" after years of hoarding secrets, but motivation for leaking specs lacks depth beyond Jun's poetic "transpose life" line; "constricted breathing" edges toward label-speak without sufficient prior embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through procedural density (teak rulers, light channels) to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "exhale tasted larger" but microdot stakes signaled too late—closure saved by the beam's mathematical blueprints reweighting "open secrets" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Teak rulers and light channels function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (mirror adjustments) and charges the final image ("key change"); "wind scraped... like a file on bone" grounds urgency in tactile specificity without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through light-channel assembly, but protagonist agency falters—they follow Jun's lead rather than driving escalation; "why share?" question gets poetic but shallow answer, diluting the felt cost of leaking specs despite chest-loosening epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Secrets are only cages we pretend are keys" emerges organically from light mechanics, not moralizing; final beam-as-"key change" reweights "open secrets" with conceptual cost without stating a moral, though "transpose life" borders on abstract prompt-language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in agent's tactical focus ("slotting angles like brush passes") and Jun's poetic indirection; "voice breaking like surf" modulates rhythm under pressure, though "breathe the key of tomorrow" risks overwritten abstraction in the final beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but minor overwriting: "spelling blueprints native only to mathematics and wonder" muddles clarity; "light rivered" metaphor slightly strains physics, though rhythm variation ("waves broke, recovering shards of starlight") sustains propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes via light-based data transmission ("semaphore for the blind"), but fortune cookie framing feels familiar; risk-taking (leaking specs via lighthouse) heightens stakes coherently, though "open secret" concept lacks fresh moral calculus beyond poetic idealism.</comment>
