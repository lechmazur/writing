<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Seraphin's exile/grief duality; micro-choices like offering the ribbon reveal generational stakes. But "endearingly feisty" label risks stock phrasing without deeper embodiment during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "breach had not exiled him; it had planted him" reconfigures exile with conceptual cost via reaffirmed vows. Lens (Hybrid/Accumulative) holds from rumor to petal signatures without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices—roots as stairs, glass shards for healing—and charges the final image where petals "clung like signatures." Copper twine/glass mechanics feel tactile and necessary, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly when Liora reveals Guild sabotage; Seraphin's agency drives the repair under rising pressure. Cost is legible in "petals like signatures" but could deepen the physical toll of his limping exile during the climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "deciduous vows" transform from shredded guilt to petal-signatures, rejecting simplistic redemption. Final image reweights exile as renewal without moralizing, though "accidental wisdom" risks abstraction in the repair beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz sphere cooled against bone," "fruit hung like planets") sustains rhythmic control. Voice modulates flawlessly from memory to action, with no POV slippage during high-stakes repair.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom perched quietly" risks abstract label in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise, prose achieves remarkable density: copper twine/glass mechanics advance plot and theme without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "deciduous vows" as living metaphor (maple scraps → petal signatures) transforms exile tropes. Emotional specificity in Seraphin's quartz eye—chalice shard turned healing tool—avoids gimmickry while charging closure.</comment>
