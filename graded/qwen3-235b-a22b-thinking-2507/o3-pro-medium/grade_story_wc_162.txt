<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "featherly determined" resolve vs. relentless pursuit; closure choice (walking threshold without sacredness) earned through cathedral-of-absence realization. Arin lacks depth as crucible but scope permits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "she feared that finding it might also close the cathedral she had built inside absence." Accumulative lens holds via wood-grain/logbook density escalation; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wood chair's grain functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tracing thresholds) and charges final image: maze rebuilding "from the echo of deliberate gaps." Prism terrace pressure shapes all key decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: Arin's question about "holy" distances crystallizes Mira's realization that the blueprint was "a prayer disguised as agriculture." Cost unmistakable in cathedral-of-absence endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final line "refining the art of hush until fracture sounded like promise" offers non-literal answer to sacred threshold paradox without moralizing. Theme emerges from wood-grain/knot particulars rather than abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mira's pattern-focused noticing ("prism shadows reassemble into corridors"); rhythm modulates from lyrical to sparse under pressure. Arin's dialogue slightly abstract but consistent with scholar role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "varnish gleamed like trapped sunset" exemplifies purposeful density. Final line crystallizes propulsion without figurative muddle. "Featherly determined" risks strain but redeems through repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze + weather code as sacred geometry; emotional truth in endurance ("not to be found but to walk"). Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
