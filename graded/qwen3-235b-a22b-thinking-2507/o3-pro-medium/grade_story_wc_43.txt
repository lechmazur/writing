<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete micro-choices: Hector’s "decisively kind" trait manifests when thanking the intern despite weakness, and Mateo’s tears as "small mirrors" embody emotional contradiction without therapy-speak. Flaws (estrangement, time scarcity) compound organically toward earned reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Hector’s whispered "hello" crystallizes decades of regret loosening, charged by the vinyl shard. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—sound-layering density tightens stakes, and the "lightning air" scent reprise makes cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The vinyl shard constrains choices and charges closure: Hector’s bedside drawer placement, Mara’s terrace recording, and the hand-over-shard moment directly alter tactics. Vapor roses and oxygen hiss aren’t decor—they shape Mara’s soundcraft and Hector’s sensory experience, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: Blood work’s "hours, not days" creates a live clock, and sound-layering narrows options toward reconciliation. Cost is visible in Mateo’s tears and the "decades of regret beginning to loosen," but Hector’s swift transformation slightly undercuts the pressure’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "Hymning the mundane" becomes literal music that reunites father/son, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("moonlit clouds drift like slow applause") reweights "flawless goodbye" without stating a moral, embracing complexity through sensory truth rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "Hope smelled like air after lightning" filters setting through Mara’s music-therapist lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("IV drip became metronome... monitor beep persistent bell") compresses tension without losing clarity, and elision (Mateo’s silent arrival) is taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "Drip of IV became metronome" does triple duty (sound, metaphor, character insight) without muddle. Final line "goodbyes approached flawlessly" recharges motif with precision—no figurative clutter dulls the closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms hospice trope through specific, irreplaceable details: Vinyl shard with Sofia’s lipstick ghost, vapor roses, and oxygen-as-trombone synthesize emotional truth. Risk-taking in mundane sounds as music heightens stakes, though Mateo’s instant thaw slightly edges toward emotional arithmetic.</comment>
