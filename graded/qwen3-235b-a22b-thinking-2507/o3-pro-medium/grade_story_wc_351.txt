<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "fear brushed her thoughts, but curiosity pushed harder" and embodied micro-choices like the whispered vow, though "chaotically precise" remains labeled rather than stress-tested. Final renunciation of ownership for witness status earns closure through prior causality, but flaw integration lacks visceral tradeoffs in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "not as owner... but as witness" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (relinquished control), legible in the exhale-with-canyon image. Accumulative lens holds through memory-density escalation, with lunar voids tightening options toward custodianship—no causality breaks in this tight 650-word arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon functions as active micro-setting, constraining choices via the light-corridor path and charging closure through the "exhale" symbiosis. Basalt amphitheater organ pipes mirror her internal shift, while the mirror’s stitched constellations reweight prior fractures—environment shapes every tactical move without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through protagonist agency: cataloging memories evolves from technical act to custodianship crisis, narrowing options until the witness/vow tradeoff. Conceptual cost—"refusing possession"—is unmistakable in the final image, with synaptic plasticity’s memory migration redefining her role under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: the mirror’s "stitched constellations" reprise answers "archeologist of abandoned dreams" by showing custodianship as non-ownership. Final line "dreams... refuse to remain silent" delivers resonant, non-literal wisdom without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in engineer-poet duality ("read spirals of code as double-stranded prayers"), with rhythm tightening during memory flashes. Minor register drift in "trembling curtains of possibility" slightly dilutes pressure, but syntactic control under stress (e.g., "Fear brushed... curiosity pushed harder") sustains distinct voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; density peaks in "fiber-optic nerves grown rather than soldered," though "chaotically precise" label lacks concrete demonstration. Final line’s propulsion ("refuse to remain silent") charges closure, but one ornamental phrase ("trembling curtains of possibility") slightly muddles momentum without harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned tech" trope through specific, lived detail: synaptic plasticity as emotional conduit and "braille-like code" recorder. Risk-taking in quiet closure—custodianship over conquest—heightens stakes without gimmickry, while engineer-mind lens makes universals feel freshly inevitable.</comment>
