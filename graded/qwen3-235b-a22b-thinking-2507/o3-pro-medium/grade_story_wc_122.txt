<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maris's deafness shapes her bone-conducted perception and micro-choices (reversing mechanism, tuning drums), but "emotional numbness" label slightly undermines embodied emotion early on; tears later redeem it with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully through villagers' physical reactions and Maris's salt-starved tears, but filament's "glowed brighter" feels convenient rather than earned under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "unclenched fists" and "tears shaping cheeks".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cavern's cedar/pitch smells and stone vibrations constrain every choice; final image of leaves echoing in drums charges the setting perfectly, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure deepens through sensory density ("warmth bled into stone walls"), narrowing Maris's options until drums absorb seasons; cost undeniable in villagers' unclenched fists and Maris's tears under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Finally feeling" emerges organically from bone-vibrations and salt-starved tears without moralizing; "audibly muted yet profoundly heard" reweights silence as active resonance, avoiding thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's tactile POV shines ("fingertips decoding graphite indentations"), but "threatened to enthrall" slightly generic; rhythmic control in climax ("skins trembling like migratory wings") maintains distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose stumbles only in adjacent paraphrase: "fractured metal seemed whole, alive with pulsing quiet" then "audibly muted music mirrored the hush fragment"; otherwise high density with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope through haptic music—the backward phonograph as emotional conduit feels fresh; "audibly muted" reframing of silence elevates beyond gimmickry with conceptual integrity.</comment>
