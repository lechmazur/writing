<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but shallow interiority; sacrifice shown yet contradictory impulses under pressure lack concrete embodiment beyond archetypal duty. "Fingers trembled with purpose" signals conflict yet remains abstract without specific, character-particular micro-choices during pivotal weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Earned Stasis closure with visible cost (aging, silence devouring sound), but orientation delayed past 120 words ("bamboo forest" anchor arrives late) and lens ambiguity pre-midpoint undermines causal coherence. Cost proof solid in "aged a season" progression yet lens clarity check deduction applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("blossoms smelled like distant rain") anchors atmosphere, but setting functions decoratively rather than constraining choices. Pear orchard/bamboo forest lacks pressure on tactics; micro-setting potential (loom threads) isn't leveraged to charge the final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message delivery) signaled early with visceral cost (self-sacrifice), yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening—puzzle method executes flawlessly without obstacles or deepening knowledge shifts. Agency manifests as endurance, but pressure accumulation feels inevitable rather than contested under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: "silences, once raveled, can recommence as song" crystallizes sacrifice/memory without moralizing. Final bead glow reweights amber's meaning with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo while sustaining ambiguity about the boy's reception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (loom-focused sensory bias) and rhythmic control elevate tension, but high-band gate fails—Q2<8.8 caps category. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure ("shuttle beat softer than breath"), yet "wistful" label slightly undermines embodied specificity in peak sacrifice beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; "river of unheard gold" risks mixed metaphor but payoff justifies it. Final image ("expired like a candle") avoids closure artifacts, though mid-beat "stoically sparkling" repetition approaches ornamental loop—deducted 0.1 for near-synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving mechanics (puzzle edges as sound pathways) transforms familiar sacrifice trope, but "message across impossible distance" premise risks template familiarity. Emotional specificity in the amber bead's evolution prevents derivative feel, with bamboo roots anchoring universals concretely.</comment>
