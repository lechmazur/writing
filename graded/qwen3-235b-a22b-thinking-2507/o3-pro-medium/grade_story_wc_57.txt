<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "infinitely patient" vs urgency to preserve; micro-choice trading seeds for rope study reveals hierarchy of values. Lacks deeper internal conflict beyond patience, preventing 9.0 despite strong embodied emotion in frost-bollard waiting and "roots gripping my ribs" germination metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "guard that chain until the cradle inside the earth rocked open" crystallizes lifelong guardianship with visceral ribcage hush. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (knots→fulgurite→cradle) and cadence shift at "I understood then" reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass constrains choice (tapping tube) and charges final image ("glowed softly, guiding me back"). Snow-frosted bollard, rope knots, and obsidian water aren't decorative but tactile constraints shaping action—micro-setting excellence where environment functions as active participant in preservation quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when weavers redefined as "instructions," narrowing options to guardianship. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding rope enables fulgurite discovery, with cost legible in "pledge felt like germination... roots gripping my ribs." Lacks one visible price altering tactics mid-beat for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image—"golden dock under snow would bloom"—resonantly answers "how to hear secret weavers" without moralizing. Theme emerges through knot/fulgurite/cradle recurrence, rejecting object-preservation for "wisdom grows only by relay." Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gulls stitched pale circles," "rope spoke better than he could" filters world through seed-collector's lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("snowflakes drifted like stray feathers, yet water remained black and calm") with no head-hopping. Elision (weavers' nature) taught early and paid off in cradle revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ivory flash speared the dune" exemplifies high-density propulsion. "Foghorn in miniature" simile avoids cliché while serving character voice. Near-miss: "oceanic hush swallowed the world" risks overwriting but justified by Sera's philosophical POV and closure callback.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "quest for secret keepers" trope through storm-as-loom premise. Fresh inflection in fulgurite-seed symbiosis: lightning sealing pod creates irreplaceable causal logic. Avoids abstraction via cattail/moon-snail cradle details. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
