<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("shivers not from cold but intimacy of borrowed guilt"), but lacks contradictory impulses; "mediator not confessor" tells rather than shows internal conflict during pivotal communion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "lantern swinging... neither lie nor truth" crystallizes emotional cost of inherited storms with undeniable conceptual weight under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns actively constrain choices (grounding against slick crystal, reading frost sigils), charging the final image where "frost patterns faded" leaving only "glass, her breath, and faint taste of sea."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through prism's emotional revelations, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Ilara passively receives visions rather than overcoming obstacles to prove her theory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through prism/frost transformation ("soil absorbs rain... transforming into richer loam"), with final image rejecting symbolic convenience while embracing emotional complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline whorls rearranged into map of storms") with rhythmic control, though "truthful lies" repetition creates minor cadence loop during high-pressure communion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, but adjacent synonym churn ("shame soaked... shame now bled") and "breath clouding" vs later "breath" inconsistency slightly dull mid-scene momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional residue concept through specific frost-prism mechanics, though "mystic communing with objects" trope risks familiarity without the car-window innovation.</comment>
