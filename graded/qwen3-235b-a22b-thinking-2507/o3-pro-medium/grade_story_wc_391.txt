<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in impatience faltering before "logic of her engineering" earns change; embodied emotion through "shivering not from weather" and magnetic viaduct interaction. Mapper lacks internal conflict despite vivid exterior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: narrator's vow to "rechart every impatient road" forecloses haste with felt cost ("impulse faltered"). Accumulative lens holds through moon-path tracking culminating in viaduct's blue arcs reconfiguring urgency into "hushed resolve".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt viaduct constrains choices (detouring ice stress lines) and charges closure: "leaving the viaduct singing" reweights revolution as enduring resonance. Iron beads and copper rods evolve causally from "frozen rain" to "arcs of blue".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unyoking thought from haste) tightens via moon-path alignment; cost legible when narrator's "impulse faltered." Pressure grows accumulatively through subsurface echoes and lunar vectors without causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "promises stretch; borders stop" crystallizes through viaduct's arcs unyoking thought. Avoids moralizing by showing patience as "breathing revolution" felt in wolves' hesitation and historians' future confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "stormwater remembered tides older than salt" and "ice thick as glass spun for giants." Dialogue avoids therapy-speak; mapper's "patient revolution" carries subtext through "tent of silence" embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "lantern breathing small gold" exemplifies multi-jobbing lines. Minor overwriting in "bruised dusk" but no closure muddle. Final image ("revolution kept breathing") achieves propulsion without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "slow revolution" trope through magnetic physics and lunar rhythms. Risk-taking in making patience an active engineering process ("sculpt patience from impatience") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
