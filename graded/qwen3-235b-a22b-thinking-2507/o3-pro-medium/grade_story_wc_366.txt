<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ellis's reticence manifests in micro-choices (pocketing pebble, naming "Anchor") with embodied contradiction—cautious yet naming the glass—though internal conflict lacks overt struggle in peak moments; Marla/Joel apply subtle pressure through shared dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "wary peace" and "sea will remember names" crystallize the cost of guardianship; Accumulative lens holds through stone/glass accumulation; orientation clear by line 3 with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sea glass and stone cairn function as micro-setting, constraining choices (Ellis placing shard on pedestal) and charging the final image ("ripples stacked like stones"); sensory specificity ("paraffin, salt, faint lavender") filters through Ellis's skipper perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Ellis's agency (arranging reply stones), but the conceptual cost of eternal vigilance ("wary peace") feels slightly oblique; pressure tightens via Accumulative lens with the relit lamp reconfiguring safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through objects: chain letter as "quiet network of guardians" avoids moralizing; final image reweights safety as collective action without stating morals, though "bottle the feeling" edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dread that glimmered like static," "syllables" for stones) with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from dread to "anchored hush" without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("five flat stones stacked like syllables") with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle even in peak beats ("luminescent ache" remains character-particular).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through stone code and sea glass chain; emotional specificity ("Call it Anchor, for anchors know both falling and holding") avoids cliché with risk-taking that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
