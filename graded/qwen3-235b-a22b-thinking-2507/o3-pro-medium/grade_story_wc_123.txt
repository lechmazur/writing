<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Hilara's integrity vs safety tension; embodied stress when "notebooks felt heavier than clouds" and hesitation transmitting codes shows micro-choices under pressure. Coren's rushed backstory slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: notebooks gaining "momentum toward honest weather" reweights archival purpose with visible cost (career risk). Causal lens holds tightly from message discovery to gate activation, with footsteps shadowing as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (plastine film) constrains the climax—Coren needs Hilara's city clearance codes specifically because of her storm-recorder tools. Final "layered tranquility" charge from wind chimes to tea reconfigures the rain's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when transmitting passcodes forecloses safety; visible cost in "footsteps shadowing her alley" alters tactics. Agency-driven escalation under causal lens—message discovery directly motivates lateral route and code transmission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "storms teach mercy" earned by marsh diversion saving both sides. Final image of shared tea reweights integrity as mutual survival, avoiding moralizing while resonating with "symphony of mutual survival."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "monkish rigor" and "barometric paper" lexicon; stress compression during journey ("each hour she compared pressure readings") modulates rhythm. No POV leaks despite Coren's introduction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "magnetic filings against ribs" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor abstraction in "trembled" but immediately anchored by screwdriver action. Final line's "awaiting the next coordinates" charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology bureaucracy and exile resilience; "rogue quarantine zone" transformed through storm-data stakes. Emotional specificity in archivists' integrity avoids tropes, with "reclaimed marshes" offering non-obvious solution.</comment>
