<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in vineyard parallels—Mourvedre passion vs Grenache fragility—without therapy-speak; embodied emotion via calloused thumb tracing scorched paper. Final shift to "tending" memory earns closure, but "intersubjective understanding" label risks abstraction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: "no longer guarding against memory, but tending to it" crystallizes stance with visceral cost in the letter’s fragility. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through vineyard metaphor to charged final image. Lens named by midpoint (Mourvedre/Grenache parallel).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber pavilion’s "honey" light and fermented earth scent charge the closure image, but setting rarely constrains choice; micro-setting triumphs as the letter fragment’s fragility embodies care required for "true things." Autumn leaf lace metaphor elevates final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s vineyard epiphany: his realization that love was "planted in the wrong garden" forecloses bitterness with cost in the letter’s physical fragility. Agency drives escalation, but pressure lacks one visceral price beyond emotional shift (e.g., tangible loss).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through vineyard metaphors—no moralizing. Final image of scorched letter as "autumn leaf lace" reweights failure into truth without stating morals. "Wrong garden" crystallizes complexity: love was true yet doomed by chemistry, avoiding false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: vineyard owner’s gaze notices "sun-starved Grenache," "fermented earth." Rhythm modulates from reflective ("profound silence") to crystalline ("boundary line where one thing ended"). No POV slippage; lyrical compression taught early via bus departure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "scorched filigree" and "dappled light" show high density. Minor register drift: "intersubjective understanding" clashes with vineyard lexicon. Final line’s "no longer quite so alone" avoids closure muddle, but "gently persuasive" verges on abstraction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "destined mismatches" trope via Mourvedre/Grenache specificity—emotional truth rooted in viticulture. Risk-taking in quiet Earned Stasis pays off, but premise lacks one fresh inflection beyond metaphor synthesis (e.g., unique cultural lens).</comment>
