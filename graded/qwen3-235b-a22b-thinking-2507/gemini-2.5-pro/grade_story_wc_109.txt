<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows precise cartographer’s focus but lacks contradictory impulses; "mild obsession" drives micro-choices yet no internal tension surfaces under pressure. Motivation is concrete but the final renunciation lacks layered conflict beyond serene completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the dissolving star and "dying embers" of gold leaf crystallize cost while the "mournful sigh" of wind confirms earned stasis. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as silence deepens into palpable presence without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gold leaf booklet functions as indispensable micro-setting—its fragility constrains Kaelen’s movements ("hovered," "nail leaving faint indentation") and charges the closure. Storm-tossed fort remains atmospheric backdrop without tactical pressure, capping score despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as the star fades, narrowing Kaelen’s window to chart darkness; cost is visceral in "dying embers" and dissolving star. Escalation via deepening silence textures works under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven agency beyond receptive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the glyph’s "texture of this specific darkness"—a resonant answer to "endless night" without moralizing. Final image of Kaelen as "patient stone against the coming dark" reweights prior struggle into earned acceptance, avoiding all thematic anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "saline silence" and "ice-shard pauses" filter experience through cartographer’s lens. Rhythmic control modulates from "screaming chaos" to "mournful sigh," though "mild obsession" repetition slightly dilutes distinctiveness under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolding; "ambered hush" evolves without synonym churn. "Fragile, whispering of wealth surrendered to time" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "metaphysical nightmare" slightly jars but doesn’t dull closure’s crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope via cartographic obsession—mapping silence as darkness’ "contours" feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but cliffside hermit premise lacks radical freshness despite exquisite execution.</comment>
