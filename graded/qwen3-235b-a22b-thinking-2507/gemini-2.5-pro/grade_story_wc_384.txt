<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "profound peace" after trembling embodies earned endurance. Flaw: Kaelen's internal contradiction (loyalty/treason) lacks simultaneous tension during the act—focus remains singularly precise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stalactites now "measuring peace" reweights time with conceptual cost. Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens toward the ink modification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stalactites function as micro-setting: their drip constrains Kaelen’s pace ("as stalactites drip, so must he work") and charges the final image. Sanctuary’s marble and aurora aren’t backdrop—they pressure the act’s solemnity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s agency: the unbroken line’s modification forecloses war with visible cost (trembling → peace). Escalation via Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (drips, ink viscosity) narrows options toward the pinprick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "comma of liberation" reweights "calibrated treason" as compassionate forgery. Final image ("stalactites... measuring peace") offers non-literal answer to "forgive the unfinished" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Kaelen notices "aurora shimmering high above glacial ice" not as tourist but as one who feels time’s weight. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("color of pearl twilight") to surgical ("pricked the surface") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "viscous liquid" over "thick ink" shows textural specificity. Near-flaw: "wisely enduring" slightly abstracts pressure, but rhythm variation ("With a surgeon’s focus...") maintains propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "treason" via grammatical glyph—fresh inflection where semantics become liberation. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; specificity (heritage thorn, iron-gall ink) avoids trope. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
