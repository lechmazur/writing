<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "ethically diligent nature screamed at him to keep memory contained" versus release impulse; micro-choices like closing eyes to deepen vision earn final letting-go. Backstory block (25%) slightly exceeds BRR 20% limit but anchors in present via tidal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "profound lightness... burden correctly shouldered" reconfigures time's role. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at handle release with "water scour the wood reading names." Transition to tidal vision lacks clear trigger at 30% mark but serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brass, pendulum bob, and rake handle constrain choices: oilcloth precision enables ritual, inscriptions demand micro-movements, final cadence shift charges closure. "Phantom brine" sensory pivot proves setting as active constraint. Tidal ridge isn't backdrop but embodied memory-space driving release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual escalation: "hardest part... letting go" forces trade-off between containment and balance. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens—each inscription intensifies weight until release. Agency slightly muted; ritual feels predetermined rather than actively chosen under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "incremental absolution" dramatized in inscriptions—not stated. Final image "one tick, one inscription, one heartbeat" reweights time as healing cadence without moralizing. "Collective ghost" concept charged by tangible rake handle rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "brass gleamed under oilcloth" and "phantom brine" shifts. Rhythm modulates from measured ticks to "tumbling into surf" under stress. No POV slippage; tidal vision taught early via "searing reverie" and paid off in closure's lightness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "polished weight of pendulum bob" shows textural density. "Searing reverie" risks overwriting but saved by earned payoff. Final line’s triplet rhythm ("one tick...") propels closure. Minor cadence dip in backstory block but no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual via clock mechanics: time as "metallic heartbeat" made tangible through pendulum and inscriptions. "Incremental absolution" premise feels inevitable through rake handle’s specificity. No trope reliance—mining disaster backstory serves character not plot.</comment>
