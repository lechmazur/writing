<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (empirical rigor vs sudden vulnerability) drive the closure choice; Finch's obsession is embodied through the notebook. Minor deduction for near-label "vulnerability" slightly abstracting interiority during pivotal vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "small act of defiance" against Fletcher crystallizes stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—pressure builds through sensory intrusions until notebook deepens understanding. Hairline slip in "fortified quiet" phrasing slightly muddies cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel constrains choices: damp silt enables notebook discovery, scuff marks anchor fall analysis. Final image charges the setting as psychological space ("oppressive weight... began to lift"), meeting 9+ gate. Mud, lantern, and flood marks form an indispensable micro-setting triad.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs bureaucratic convenience) tightens when Elias finds the notebook, foreclosing Fletcher's theory. Cost is visible in professional defiance. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though Finch's obsession feels slightly external until journal discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: lantern as "cage," Finch's "mission." Final image reweights memory's burden without moralizing. Near-miss on 9.0— "fortified quiet" borders on abstraction, diluting the earned complexity of entangled memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watchfully calm precision," scent of "wet earth and cold iron") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control shines in vision sequences. Minor deduction: "fortified vulnerability" phrasing momentarily drifts from Elias's empirical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "frantic script," "biting cold of a winter night" show concrete specificity. One paraphrase loop ("watchfully calm precision" / "professional calm a fortress") in opening beats costs 0.3. Final paragraph's cadence shift exemplifies rhythmic mastery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical artifact and psychological entanglement avoids supernatural tropes. Emotional truth in quiet defiance elevates beyond premise. Deduction for "entangled memories" concept slightly familiar; specificity of drought-flood cycle and hexagonal lantern rescues originality.</comment>
