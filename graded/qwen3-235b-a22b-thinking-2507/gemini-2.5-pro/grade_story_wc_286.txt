<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kaelen's "stubborn question" manifests in micro-choices like watering the rose, revealing contradictory impulses (zen detachment vs urgent care). Final endurance through clay work earns visible cost: exhaustion and woven-in legacy without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly under Accumulative lens: channel repair forecloses seeking answers externally, with palpable cost in "forgetting food" and "profound silence." Lens holds from thrum escalation to final peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clay functions as micro-setting constraint—shaping repair tactics and charging the final image ("cleaned clay from his hands"). Sensory details like "waxy thyme" and honey scent actively pressure choices, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen's agency: watering the rose triggers dissolution, narrowing options to active repair. Cost escalates visibly as physical depletion ("forgetting the coming night") and emotional vulnerability to visions under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "thousand small acts of care" woven into the final image—no moralizing. "Phototropic to kindness" crystallizes conceptually when the rose act bleeds timelines, reweighting resistance as accumulated gentleness with social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun bled out," "marrow of his bones") modulates rhythm from contemplative to urgent during dissolution. Elision of beekeepers as "peaceful specters" taught early and paid off in Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "faded lantern glass" to "tucked in his shirt" shows purposeful recurrence. Final line recharges "stubborn green" with earned specificity. No figurative muddle—phrases like "river of time" avoid cliché through tactile context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism via potter's tactile lens: kindness as phototropic force and timelines as "fractured" memory feels inevitable. Specifics like alluvial clay and waxy thyme prevent abstraction, with risk-taking heightening coherence.</comment>
