<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in OmniVex trauma drives credible endurance; embodied emotion in "calloused thumb" and "guttural cry" avoids therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (fear vs hope) act simultaneously during bolt-turning climax. Slight tidying of emotional resolution prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: diamonds blanket farm with visible cost ("breathing steady for first time in years"). Hybrid lens (causal action + accumulative pressure) holds through bolt-turning climax. Orientation anchors by word 40 with cavern/mushroom farm details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm actively pressures choices (deep shafts enable resistance claim); submarine bolt as micro-setting constrains climax and charges final diamond image. Sensory details ("damp earth and ozone") filtered through Elara’s trauma avoid tourist cataloging. Irreplaceable environmental integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain vs transform Promise) tightens via Elara’s bolt-turning agency under Hybrid lens. Pressure escalates physically/psychically to "heart of a star" intensity with felt cost in resolved breathing. Single meaningful deepening (focus vs wall) forecloses overseers’ brute-force path decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-transformation emerges through bolt/diamond particulars without moralizing. Final image reweights "Debt" into diamonds as non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo despite "translate pressure" line; complexity in rejecting OmniVex’s emptiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "phantom chorus of recruiters" and glitchy text fragments. Rhythmic control under pressure via staccato fragments ("It was the OmniVex pitch amplified"). Purposeful non-standard grammar in messages taught early and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystalline lattice of pure potential" achieves high density without muddle. Strategic telling compresses OmniVex backstory efficiently. Minor tell in "hollow authority" line prevents 9.4 but no closure impact. Propulsion flawless through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum concepts with emotional alchemy: "Debt" as viscous manifestation transforms pyramid scheme trauma into diamonds. Bold risk in parallel-dimension texts pays off causally. Specificity ("mushroom farm") resists abstraction while universalizing pressure.</comment>
