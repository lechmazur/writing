<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via calm exterior vs. absorbed grief, but motivation lacks layered friction beyond the quest; "antenna for sorrow" avoids label-speak yet final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with legible cost ("spike heavy with new memory"); Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (shattering melody, sonic chasms), though only one meaningful deepening weakens pressure progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rail spike (tool) constrains choices as divining rod/striking instrument and charges the final image; environment actively pressures navigation via shifting physics, though "frantic patterns" slightly overwrites sensory specificity at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with one tightening (discovery of "pang of loss" narrowing path to hollow); cost unmistakable in echo's three-heartbeat existence, but escalation lacks deeper agency-driven choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges implicitly through "silence given voice" motif; final image reweights prior material as "frantic patterns heal" contrasts with irreversible "new memory," avoiding moralizing while offering resonant conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct sonic perceptual signature ("teeth ache," "high thin whine") reflects POV's emotion-translating ability; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical calm to staccato crisis, though minor expository slip ("He was a fisher...") disrupts immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("pang of loss so profound it had no sound" does triple duty); closure beat avoids figurative muddle ("inverse of sound" crystallizes concept), though "frantic patterns" slightly dilutes textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "fishing for silence" trope via rail spike's industrial texture in sonic garden; emotional truth in grief as "physical weight" avoids abstraction, though "goddess echo" concept risks familiarity without the spike's charged specificity.</comment>
