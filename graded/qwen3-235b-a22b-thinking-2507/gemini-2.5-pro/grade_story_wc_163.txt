<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through feather's dual symbolism, but epiphany edges toward thematic echo with "belonging wasn't about finding a replacement" triggering diagnostic label penalty. Elara's transformation earns credibility through embodied awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with felt cost in feather's meaning shift ("sharp edges of grief had been smoothed"), but sunrise deadline creates pressure without causal escalation—jellyfish arrival relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Celestial Dome functions as micro-setting charging closure through bioluminescent reflection on plasteel, though facility's failing systems remain atmospheric rather than tactical constraints. "Shadowseam wonder" phrase integrates setting with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline tightens stakes credibly, but escalation falters—Kaelen's plan succeeds via coincidental jellyfish migration rather than his agency. Cost legible in feather's reweighted meaning, yet "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" principle violated at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through feather's evolution and shared exhale, avoiding moralizing until near-final line's "belonging wasn't about..." risks thematic echo. Final violet sunrise image resonates without stating moral, though borderline phrasing costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "symphony of stressed metal" and energy mapping, but "shadowseam wonder" feels authorial rather than character voice. Elara's dialogue lacks lexical distinction from Kaelen's narration during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion; "meadow of stars" metaphor avoids purple prose through bioluminescent specificity. Minor scaffold in "world of shadowseam wonder that felt more real" slightly bloats momentum but doesn't dull closure's "impossible violet" payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "finding home" trope via deep-sea astrologer lens, but burnt feather motif remains conventional. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through sensory accumulation, though underwater setting execution lacks fresh inflection beyond established genre.</comment>
