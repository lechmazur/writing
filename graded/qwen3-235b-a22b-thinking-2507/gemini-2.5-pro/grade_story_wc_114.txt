<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values: avoiding Liam's desk, then placing the illustration on the windowsill. Embodied emotion ("auroral sorrow," "indigestible stone") avoids labels. Final endurance—keeping ambiguity—is earned by the smudge realization, with visible cost in the "atmosphere she now breathed."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes options ("equal and opposing pressures") with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density ("rhythmic click," "faint scent of ozone") culminating in the smudge's revelation. Cost legible in "sorrow remained... no longer a weight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The botanical illustration (micro-setting) constrains choice: Elara's examination forces the thematic turn, and its final placement charges closure. Sensory details ("raw wool," "ozone") reflect urgency and POV bias. Mountain setting pressures tactics—Liam's obsession with the peak's "secret beauty" directly shapes the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: examining the smudged note deepens the dominant stake (resolving ambiguity) into realizing she *needs* uncertainty. The tightening—foreclosing certainty—carries visible cost in the "clean, high-altitude ache." Pressure grows via Accumulative lens through sensory/emotional density, narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the illustration's reweighted meaning: ambiguity as necessary for grief. The final image ("atmosphere she now breathed") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity avoids false equivalence—Elara's need for duality isn't balanced but earned through her "fault-tolerant" processing of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "awareness was a wide, soft net," meteorological jargon filtered through grief. Rhythmic control shifts from feverish fragmentation ("crisp and beautiful as alpine light") to lyrical resolution. No head-hopping; all sensory input strictly Elara's, with elision (Liam's fate) taught early and paid off in the smudge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "indigestible stone" and "collapse the waveform" serve character-specific metaphors without muddle. High density—"auroral sorrow" conveys layered emotion in two words. Final line ("filled with equal and opposing pressures") crystallizes closure with propulsion. No figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "fault-tolerant oracle" reframes grief as system design. The smudge transforms a cliché (unreadable note) into inevitable emotional logic. Risk-taking elevates stakes: conceptual closure (accepting ambiguity) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Avoids safety middle via specific meteorological verisimilitude.</comment>
