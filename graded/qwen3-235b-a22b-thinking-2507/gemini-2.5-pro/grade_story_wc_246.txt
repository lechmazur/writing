<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (tracing pen while considering edits), but "confidently uncertain" label slightly abstracts the flaw; final renunciation earned by visceral cost of discarding growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("oblivate the man who learned"), but lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn't named by midpoint; pressure tightens via signal consequences without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly functions as active micro-setting (cage→cloister), and meteoritic pen constrains choice in climax; sensory details reflect urgency ("frantic energy softening").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as edits reveal cascading disasters; visible cost in physical "unbending" crystallizes the renunciation, though secondary stakes lack depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("testament to the man he became") reweights the pen without moralizing; theme emerges through concrete struggle, avoiding false balance on the colony's irrevocable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static between stars," "thresh meaning") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("began to unbend") with taught elision of backstory via pen cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("cascade of new, unpredictable consequences") with clean propulsion, though "frantic, delicate dance" slightly muddles metaphor without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel trope through emotional specificity ("discard chaff and grain together"); risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
