<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Motivation ("restore shared balance") drives action concretely through footfall rhythm. Weakness: Interior contradiction absent; "infinitely patient" stated but not tested under pressure with visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: footfall density escalates to "murmur" with conceptual cost (endurance labor). Closure (Earned Stasis) lands via "permanent anchor" hum, but cost lacks visceral immediacy for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tuning fork constrains all choices: its hum guides rhythms, vibrates through boots, and becomes the town's "permanent anchor." Final image charges closure by settling the hum into the ground, reweighting the opening "wild hush."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (shared balance) tighten via accumulating footfalls narrowing options to pure endurance. Cost ("walked for hours") is felt but insufficiently embodied; the conceptual price needs sharper physical manifestation to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "rhythm of footsteps" embodies "balance as rhythm to be maintained." Final image ("rebuild a soul one footstep at a time") reweights the opening collapse without moralizing, though abstraction slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "sculptor of echoes," "ghosts of sound" reflect Elias' tuning expertise. Rhythm mirrors footfall patterns ("clap...murmur...thrum"), though "bruised twilight sky" slips into cliché, breaking voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("spectral imprint of a thousand lives"). But "bruised twilight sky" and "sculptor of echoes" verge on purple prose in peak beats, dulling closure's clarity just enough to cap below 8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity in reviving towns via footfall physics feels fresh, avoiding trope through specific mechanics ("cobblestones as keys"). Risk-taking heightens stakes, though the "shared balance" concept lacks the non-obvious moral calculus needed for 9.0+.</comment>
