<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael's intruder guilt vs protective duty; micro-choice of unfolding sketch reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost ("diary now feeling heavier"). Slight label slip in "breath caught" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: folded sketch crystallizes reconfigured understanding with undeniable emotional cost ("affectionate detachment"). Accumulative lens holds through elevator-floor cadence; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Goggles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (deciphering diary) and charges closure (words dissolving when removed). "Scattered light" mechanics integrated into action, not mere description; environment pressures discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (understanding Elara's truth) tightens through elevator ascent; "unfold" action forecloses path to ignorance with felt cost. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens—Kael's choices narrow options toward crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gap-toothed sketch and "sun is warm" line reweight anguish as active hope. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids sentimentality via embodied discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "warmly inquisitive" noticing of light patterns; rhythmic control mirrors elevator ascent. Focalization stays locked to Kael's lexicon—no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shimmering script that seemed to shift and writhe" does triple duty). Minor "breath caught" cliché in peak beat prevents 9.5, but no figurative muddle. Opening/closing lines reprise meaningfully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via specific, grounded details: encrypted diary through goggles, motherhood secret. Fresh synthesis of "armor of anguish" concept feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens emotional truth.</comment>
