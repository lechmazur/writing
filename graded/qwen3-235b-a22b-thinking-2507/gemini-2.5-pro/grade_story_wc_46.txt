<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's wisdom and fire trauma creates authentic interior contradiction; "weighing" the shard against "heavy burden of that past" crystallizes micro-choice with embodied cost. Slight underdevelopment of trauma's visceral impact limits full 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the glass's self-sustaining luminescence reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost ("a quiet light for a world too loud"). Orientation perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic polishing escalation to transformative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto actively pressures choices (mist blocks stars, salt enables polishing); sea glass as micro-setting charges final image with "aquatic light" revealing stone maps. Minor spatial ambiguity in tool placement prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately ("share light without fire"); polishing process drives meaningful deepening where each stroke narrows options. Cost legible in "erasing lines of concentration" and rejection of fire's legacy, perfectly aligned with Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sea glass transformation: "starlight patient and eternal" vs fire's consumption. Final image of "quiet light for a world too loud" delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting grandmother's wisdom with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frosted skin" of glass, "zephyr bloom" as tactile encouragement), but "zephyr bloom" slightly disrupts lexicon in high-pressure beat. Rhythmic control mirrors polishing motions; no head-hopping, voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "absorbed it, held it, and then began to emanate" shows syntactic variation. Minor scaffold in "she began her work with careful, repetitive motions" (-0.1), but zero loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms light-making trope through coastal specificity: sea glass as "artifact of reclamation" feels inevitable. Bold risk in quiet climax rejecting fire's dominance; emotional truth anchored in salt-stained hands and oceanic history.</comment>
