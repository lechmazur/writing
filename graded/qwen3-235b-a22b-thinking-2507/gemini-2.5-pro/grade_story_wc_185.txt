<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: ancient precision vs desperate urgency embodied in "weathered fingertips" tracing ice fractures. Final choice earns repose with visible cost—"true and earned repose"—avoiding therapy-speak. Minor flaw: underdeveloped inevitable mistake beyond exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: "hard-won quiet washing over him" crystallizes physical toll. Accumulative/Textural lens held flawlessly through sensory density escalation ("hum sharpening to needle-point"). Orientation anchors ("harmonic caves," "energy beings") established by word 20.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harmonic caves actively constrain choices—amplifying noise forces ice-catalyst ritual. Echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting charging closure via "steady, peaceful rhythm." Tactile details ("salt-veined rock," "fissure") shape action, meeting 9+ gate requirement for environment charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: sensory density builds to "needle-point" hum during ritual. Cost is visceral—"dust sifting from ceiling," "bones protesting"—and legible in earned repose. Dominant stake (surviving sonic invasion) signaled immediately and tightened via Kaelen’s internalization of ice patterns under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "symphony of terrestrial whispers" vs "alien static." Final image ("found its eye") reweights storm metaphor without moralizing. "Bloom of hush" evolves from conceptual void to lived experience, offering resonant answer to central question via Kaelen’s earned stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "light seemed weary," "crackle swallowed by din" filter sensory detail through Kaelen’s exhaustion. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during ritual ("Now was the moment to conjure"). Zero head-hopping; syntax compression in climax feels intentional and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence does triple duty (e.g., "air grew colder, the hum sharpening" advances setting, escalation, and sensory detail). No figurative muddle—"fortress of will" serves pressure without obscuring cause/effect. Final line crystallizes closure with "found its eye" recharging motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet vs noise" trope through geological specificity: "ripple-mark mapkeeper" defines method, not decoration. Harmonic caves concept made fresh via ice cartography. Synthesis feels inevitable—"bloom of hush" emerges organically from prior particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
