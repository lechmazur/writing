<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic vs. intuition) drives the subway quest and lantern-lighting choice; "clover melancholy" to "quiet peace" shows embodied emotional progression. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional layering in the library scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "The only sure thing is a beautiful risk" crystallizes the reconfiguration. One non-closure issue (cipher mechanics' convenience) triggers -0.8 cap, but cost legibility at "melancholy remained, but quiet peace" is flawless under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mica pane constrains every choice (deciphering symbols, subway navigation) and charges the final image as "a shadow within the light." Micro-setting functions as environment when the rail yard balcony enables the closure moment's physical and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aris' active subway hunts (accumulative escalation), culminating in the balcony's conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under Hybrid lens as her method shifts from academic to intuitive, with the lantern-lighting choice foreclosing her zero-risk existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely from concrete actions: the subway cipher transforms "lucid contradictions" into lived wisdom. Final image reweights "clover melancholy" without moralizing—Aris' realization ("not become him, but finally understood") is earned through the rail yard confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via academic lens ("probability professor," "chaotic systems") coloring descriptions ("impossibly fine scrawls"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax: short sentences ("The flame flickered...") mirror her surrender to intuition without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances story (e.g., "dog-eared racing forms" establishes character while propelling action). Final line recharges "clover" motif with new meaning. One minor overwriting ("impossibly fine") avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms gambler trope through probability framework and subway cipher system. Emotional specificity ("zero-risk is its own gamble") avoids cliché, while the rail yard balcony creates a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of math and beauty that heightens stakes.</comment>
