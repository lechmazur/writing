<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete cues (thread texture, phantom loom ache) avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice of writing under dying light shows hierarchy of values. Lacks contradictory impulses in Elara's off-page motivation despite vivid projection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("chill sharper," "silence deeper") reconfiguring healing's meaning. Orientation clear by 100 words; Accumulative lens (density increase → cadence shift) held through closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden setting charges final image: "mossy ground" and "wisteria" constrain Kaelen's stillness, while thread-as-tool transforms from object to "key." Sensory specificity ("rust-colored chrysanthemums," "wool-and-incense smell") mirrors internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kaelen's projection (agency: choosing to feel Elara's grief), narrowing options to writing as healing. Cost legible in physical chill intensifying post-revelation; Accumulative escalation via sensory density reweights "geography of healing" without causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line ("perfectly, finally, navigated") offers non-literal answer to "explained absences," reweighting carpet as destination. Avoids moralizing; theme emerges from thread/weft motifs charging closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "damp, sweet scent of decay" filters through Kaelen's obituary lens. Rhythmic control in projection sequence ("rhythmic shudder... whisper-soft scrape") modulates under pressure; no head-hopping despite dual consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scarlet weft thread" evolves from "pilfered" object to "biography in miniature" with precise diction. Final image ("dying light... quiet testament") achieves high density without muddle; cadence accelerates during projection then breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "obituaries for the living" trope through weaving-as-cartography synthesis; emotional specificity in "phantom ache in her shoulders" avoids generality. Risk-taking (off-page protagonist) heightens stakes but lacks one fresh inflection for 9+.</comment>
