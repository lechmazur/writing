<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (professional duty vs obsessive search) through micro-choices like the lie to Kael; embodied emotion in "heart hammered against ribs" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of safety for truth earns closure but lacks deeper internal conflict beyond grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sending Julian's data packet crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("inconvenient truths hidden"). Causal lens holds (number pattern → coordinates → discovery) with orientation clear by para 1. Minor deduction for Kael's slightly convenient interruption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Seraphim-7 patch functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (coordinates decode) and charges the final image (physical patch against skin). Server "gloom" and audio-tagging details are purpose-driven, though environmental pressure could deepen tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs corporate cover-up) tightens through Elara's agency—her pattern recognition drives escalation. Kael's confrontation narrows options credibly, but the supervisor's sudden appearance slightly softens causal pressure; cost remains conceptual not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: Seraphim-7's "beautiful attempt" reframes truth-seeking. Final image ("brought back into the light") resonates without moralizing, though "inconvenient truths" borders on thematic echo. No false binaries; complexity in corporate complicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sharp pinprick of light in digital gloom" reflects Elara's focus. Voice modulates under pressure (terse commands during hack). No head-hopping; dialogue with Kael carries subtext. Slight register dip in "psychological profiles" but compensated by rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("frantic drumbeat in server’s silence"). "Digital constellations" metaphor integrates cleanly. Minor deduction: "low hum beneath server noise" risks cliché but redeemed by tactile payoff with physical patch. Final line recharges opening imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "missing persons" trope via digital archaeology. Specific audio-tagging innovation and Seraphim-7 motif feel organic. Risk-taking (corporate memory as janitorial role) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic grief.</comment>
