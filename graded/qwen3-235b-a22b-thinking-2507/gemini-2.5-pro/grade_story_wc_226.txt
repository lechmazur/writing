<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s "innocently mischievous" trait drives micro-choices (nursery-rhyme delivery disarming Wardens), but motivation lacks depth beyond "defiant artist" label; Kael’s fear is embodied yet underutilized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: refracted echoes shatter monolithic truth with felt cost ("price of her art now due"); accumulative lens holds as echoes intensify pressure toward crystallized Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon setting actively constrains choices (acoustics shape poetry delivery) and charges finale—echoes refracting into symphony reweights the bone towers’ symbolism with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via ritual countdown (horn signal) forcing Elara’s final act; agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens, but horn timing borders on convenient escalation without deepening Kael’s prior warning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted echoes as non-literal answer to "price of forgiveness," avoiding moralizing; nearly flawless but "refract light into rainbow" risks thematic echo without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("forged hush" as tactile weight) and rhythmic control during poetry delivery; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" lexicon during high-stress beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but "A spire of bone, a truth of stone" cadence echoes earlier structure, dulling momentum; figurative density remains clear yet slightly repetitive in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound physics as rebellion tool feels inevitable; transforms "silence vs. voice" trope through canyon acoustics, with refracted echoes offering fresh emotional specificity in closure.</comment>
