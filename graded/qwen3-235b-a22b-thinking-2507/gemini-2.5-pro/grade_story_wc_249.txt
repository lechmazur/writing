<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's embodied grief through drumming reveals contradictory impulses (defiance/longing), but "sorrow was as beautiful" risks abstraction; micro-choices like silent corridor movement earn her endurance without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: the empty space beside her crystallizes loss with undeniable cost, and the Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation; minor slip in "profound emptiness" lacking visceral specificity in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden's emitters constrain her action (drumming on slab), and the auric lagoon charges the final image—environment directly shapes the closure's emotional charge and irreplaceable symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her drumming agency under Accumulative lens, deepening the dream's resurrection; cost is legible in the tear and empty space, though "profound emptiness" slightly abstracts the felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the lagoon's charged reprise—love persisting beyond science—without moralizing; final image answers the central question by fusing memory and loss into a tangible, bittersweet testament.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("auric lagoon," "metallic flora") and rhythmic control mirror drumming intensity; no head-hopping, but "sorrow was as beautiful" momentarily drifts from embodied POV toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose excels in texture ("pool of soft, golden light shimmered"), but "sorrow was as beautiful and as sharp as the dawn" introduces abstract lyricism in a peak beat, slightly dulling visceral impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through synesthesia and sound-wave specificity; emotional truth in drumming as rebellion feels fresh, though the "auric lagoon" concept borders on familiar magical realism without deeper innovation.</comment>
