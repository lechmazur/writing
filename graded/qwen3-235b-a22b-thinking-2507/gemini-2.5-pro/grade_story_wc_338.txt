<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices (fogged breath, steady hand) and concrete contradiction: clinical framing vs. empathetic breach. No diagnostic labels, but the flaw of obsessive focus isn't tested under pressure until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "threshold found" annotation crystallizes the cost of shattered assumptions. Accumulative lens holds—the lichen discovery reweights meaning through density, not causality. Cost is undeniable in "tremor of connection" breaching her shields.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop dehumidifiers and lichen-clad vault constrain choices—she decodes silence through archival tools. Final annotation charges the map as active participant. Micro-setting (vellum tear) directly shapes the climax’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulating visual evidence: the lichen line proves human intervention, narrowing options from "accident" to "deliberate seal." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; cost is the burden of knowing a secret was hidden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: "interpret silence" becomes literal via footage comparison. Final annotation offers non-literal answer—thresholds demand respect, not repair—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the henge’s purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: mapmaker’s "spider-scratch," lichen as "faded paint." Voice modulates from clinical ("methodical curiosity") to visceral ("silence screamed") under pressure. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lichen clung like faded paint" layers setting, foreshadowing, and thematic resonance. Final line’s "whisper had finally been heard" recharges the opening motif with devastating economy. One minor elevated phrase ("landscape of knowledge") barely dents perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "ancient secret" trope through map-framer lens: silence interpreted via archival science. Risk-taking with silent footage pays off thematically. Lacks one fresh inflection beyond the lichen discovery’s brilliance.</comment>
