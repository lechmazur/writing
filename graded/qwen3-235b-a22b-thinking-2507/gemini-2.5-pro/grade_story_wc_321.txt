<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finn's contradictory impulses—suppressed panic versus duty—drive micro-choices like noticing patterns under stress. Final renunciation (accepting "permanent transient" state) is earned through causal observation-to-action progression. Captain Eva's memory wipe slightly undermines flaw integration but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "sailor forever caught between shores" crystallizes the conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Causal links hold from pattern observation to radio manipulation, with cost legible in the final image. Minor softening via Captain Eva's plausible lie prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's geometric patterns directly constrain Finn's tactics (radio tuning), while the hourglass evolves from empty to full, charging the final image. Micro-setting (radio static) shapes choices, meeting 9+ gate requirement through actionable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is causal and agency-driven: passive observation tightens to active pattern-weaving, foreclosing escape. Cost is unmistakable in "permanent transient" state. Dominant stake (merge timelines) is signaled early and reweights options through Finn's deliberate radio manipulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (hourglass, radio patterns), not abstraction. Final image reweights "route" concept with conceptual cost ("between seams of what was and what could have been") without stating a moral. Captain Eva's memory wipe slightly dilutes cost legibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Finn notices "geometric shapes" in static, not just sound. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("panic was a luxury" compression vs. lyrical grotto description). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored to deckhand lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "beetle skittering off waxed leaf" shows textural specificity. Final paragraph's "greasy fog" to "silvery sand" progression avoids cliché. Peak-beat clarity in "composing a symphony of static" with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing-ferry trope through quantum mechanics made visceral. Emotional specificity in Finn's quiet endurance (not heroics) elevates risk. "Spectral grotto woven from solidified moonlight" feels fresh while serving causal logic.</comment>
