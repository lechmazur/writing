<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (desperate hope vs "recklessly desperate" self-assessment) manifest in micro-choices like memorizing then scuffing snow code. Final turn toward Pyrenees earns endurance through pillbox talismanism without tidy resolution. "Fracture in shared world" crystallizes cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Elias' turn toward action crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("fracture he now has chance to mend"). Causal lens holds from mist-as-ally setup to snow-code payoff. Minor contrivance in Kestrel's pillbox reflection appearance costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist functions as tactical constraint (ephemeral meeting enabling no records) while pillbox evolves from grief object to talisman. Final image of turning from bluff with engraved metal charges closure through micro-setting. Avoids weather clichés via operational specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when snow code reveals "she's alive"—escalating from personal guilt to urgent rescue. Agency-driven escalation as Elias deciphers then chooses action. Conceptual cost ("fracture in shared world") legible in final image without physical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "unused courage" transforms from abstract ache to Pyrenees-bound purpose. Final line's "promise made to woman whose initials etched onto silver" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in spy lexicon ("dead-drop," "contingency") and stress-filtered details (heart hammering vs "fragile thing" whisper). Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during snow code reveal. No dialogue contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silver hush" to "watery dawn" creates visual rhythm. High density: "frozen moment of hesitation" conveys guilt without abstraction. Final line recharges pillbox motif with earned specificity. No figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trope transformation through specific grief (pillbox with *her* initials) and operational realism (snow-code dead-drop). Fresh inflection in courage as active choice rather than recovered trait. Avoids safety-middle via morally ambiguous "recklessly desperate" calculus.</comment>
