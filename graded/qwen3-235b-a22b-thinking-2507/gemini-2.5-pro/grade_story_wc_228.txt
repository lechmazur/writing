<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied through shell-tracing and painting memory, but promise motivation lacks early causal roots; "weight in his soul" payoff compensates for late emotional crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"weight felt like his own" crystallizes emotional cost under Accumulative/Textural lens; wrong turn's inevitability avoids causality breaks despite disorientation waiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cave pool's clarity constrains the shell's final descent; daylight circle charges the closure image by making the blue speck visible. Micro-setting (shell texture) directly shapes the release act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when the "wrong" cave proves the true destination, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation—Elias' calm acceptance of deviation weakens tension before the shell release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment><comment>"Temporary eternity" reweights organically through the pool scene; avoids moralizing by embedding theme in shell's descent. Final image answers "forever" question without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("grey moods of the sea," "muffled heartbeat") modulates with grief; minor filter-verb accumulation ("he remembered") in reflection beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density—"placid and undisturbed" water mirrors emotional resolution. "Study in being intimately aloof" edges toward overwriting but earns payoff in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Transforms grief tropes through painter-specific details (lacquered shell, quay miniature); "wrong turn as destiny" risks cliché but earns freshness via causal inevitability in Accumulative design.</comment>
