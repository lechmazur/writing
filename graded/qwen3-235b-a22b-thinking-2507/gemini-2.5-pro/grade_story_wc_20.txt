<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (reversing death vs understanding names) manifests in embodied choices; "sweat and tears sizzling" avoids therapy-speak while showing simultaneous grief and hope. Final endurance earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "crushing weight transmute into luminous regret" reconfigures stakes through Kael’s physical grasp of the coin. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density escalation to the fracture beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The zodiac coin functions as micro-setting, constraining every choice from knuckle-rolling to furnace sacrifice; its final "pulse against his palm" charges the closure image with tactile cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency in alchemical precision ("too much grief shatters the vessel"), narrowing options to the coin’s fracture. The drained strength and transformed coin manifest cost that alters his stance irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: "filling cracks with light" becomes earned wisdom via the coin’s golden seam, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "Elara" as light against dark without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical lexicon ("viridian for regret") and stress-compressed rhythm during the ritual; no head-hopping. "Dented disc" to "lightning-shaped crack" shows character-particular noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt for memory, viridian for regret" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "clean, quiet world" resolves rhythm while recharging the rain motif with earned clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through emotional specificity: "kintsugi of the soul" avoids cliché by grounding in tangible coin fracture. Fresh inflection lies in redeeming memory without resurrection, synthesizing grief and acceptance.</comment>
