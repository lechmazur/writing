<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "strange ambition" versus desperation; embodied emotion via the recorder’s "cold weight" and "warm in her hand." Final choice (exposing the flaw) earned by prior failures with visible cost (Silas’s humiliation). Slight over-reliance on labels like "curiously steadfast" without deeper exploration of its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Eva’s rejection crystallizes options with felt cost (fob discarded, Silas exiled). Hybrid lens (accumulative pressure from false starts, causal climax) holds. Orientation anchored by word 40 ("rotting pier... pirate market"). Cost proof: "tossed the fob onto the damp planks" makes consequence visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brass-horned recorder) constrains choice and charges final image ("warm in her hand"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: brine/mildew early, kelp’s "eerie green glow" during climax. "Rotting pier" isn’t backdrop—it shapes tactics (crab pots topple near pilings). Avoids symbolism by making setting tactile ("damp planks," "splintered crate").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing fob sale) tightens via three false starts, each narrowing options. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: chaos attempt → invoking truce → direct bid → exposing flaw. Cost is legible in Silas’s "paled" panic and Eva’s "snarl," but the sunrise deadline’s pressure isn’t tracked concretely enough to justify 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sound-as-currency: "metallic tang of unspoken agreements" evolves to "high-pitched strain of a lie tearing." Final image (recorder warming as dawn bleeds) reweights "trust breaking" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; wisdom arises from grandfather’s flaw philosophy, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Elara notices sounds ("comforting unease," "crash echoed") and textures ("homespun," "smooth scale"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("mouth opening and closing like a landed fish"). Minor register drift: "strange anchor" feels slightly elevated for her stress state, though consistent with her reflective nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("tasted of brine, mildew, and secrets"). "Comforting unease" repetition (opening/closing) charges closure. Slight overwriting in "high-pitched strain of a lie tearing under pressure"—"strain" and "tearing" compete, but payoff in "captured forever" justifies it. Final line’s "grey light... bleed" avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms pirate trope via sound-currency premise and recorder-as-weapon. Fresh inflection: "deliberate imperfection" motif reweights loyalty as flawed, not absolute. Avoids derivative middle by making Elara’s steadfastness tactical (not moral). Risk-taking (three false starts) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity in "seventh scale" grounds novelty.</comment>
