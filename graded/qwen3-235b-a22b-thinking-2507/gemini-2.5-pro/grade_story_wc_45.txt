<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rational bone setter vs yearning believer) drive micro-choices; the final constellation charting earns change through prior causality with visible self-forgiveness cost. Elara’s absence sharpens the singular POV’s embodied grief ("hollow ache for a faith he could not share").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the tooth’s discovery creates "a chasm between worlds," crystallizing stance without tidy resolution. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory/emotional density until the tooth’s revelation narrows options, with cost legible in "irreparable cleft in certainty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The trowel and changeling tooth function as micro-setting, constraining choices (digging, charting) and charging the final image. "Wilting moon-petal roses" reflect urgency while avoiding overt symbolism; sensory details are filtered through Elias’s bone-setter pragmatism ("familiar weight" of trowel).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative lens: his digging intensifies pressure, narrowing options from doubt to irreversible fracture. The dominant stake (certainty vs belief) tightens through the tooth’s discovery, with cost unmistakable in "compound fracture of the soul" and the lifetime work of self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bone-setting/star-chart particulars, not abstraction. The final constellation reweights prior material as a "resonant, non-literal answer" to fractured certainty—honoring Elara while accepting the cleft, with no moralizing. "Nostalgic innovation" crystallizes earned wisdom without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias’s bone-setter lexicon ("jagged edges," "compound fracture") shapes metaphors. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, tactile sentences at the tooth’s discovery ("tremor ran through his hands") contrast with lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; focalization remains anchored in his grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("certainty felt as flimsy as a cobweb" conveys doubt physically). Figurative language precise in peak beats ("pearlescent light" avoids purple prose). Final line’s "fracture, a testament" recharges opening motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and grief via bone-setting metaphor. Specific details (moon-petal roses, rowan box) transform tropes; emotional truth in "yearning for faith he could not share" avoids generality. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
