<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through sensory substitution ("joy and despair" of silk/stone); empathy's stir is earned by tactile process. Slight over-intellectualization in "structural understanding" risks stock phrasing but redeemed by embodied cost ("sharp, aching sorrow"). Flaws drive action organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: incised line crystallizes options with felt cost ("sharp, aching sorrow"). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks via ribbon/stone tension. Cost proof undeniable in "empathy... had finally stirred" amid frigid air. Orientation anchors within 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry constrains every choice: its geometry dictates painting method, mist guides palette. Final incised line mirrors "wound in the earth," charging closure. Sensory hierarchy masterful (ignoring faces, feeling silk's "damp sigh"). Micro-setting (ribbon fragment) alters tactics repeatedly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens via brushstroke merging opposites, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost legible in physical reaction ("shuddering breath," "aching sorrow"). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens—density shift when vibrant color meets "dead heart of gray."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: ribbon/stone tension answers "how absence defines presence" without moralizing. Final image ("swirling life consumed by gray") reweights prior material. Avoids sentimentality through embodied cost ("terror of the stone"). No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: face blindness sharpens tactile/texture focus ("frayed fragment," "rough, cold stone"). Rhythm modulates from deliberate precision to frantic lancing. Minor register drift in "profound, structural understanding" but voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("violent, unmaking" for quarry geometry). "Furrowed hush" slightly clichéd but redeemed by context. Final line’s "silent testament in a silent place" avoids overwriting. No artifacts dull closure—incised line’s visceral impact pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "artist solves mystery" trope through prosopagnosia: empathy awakened by absence, not faces. Risk-taking (art as closure) heightens stakes coherently. Specificity ("silk the color of a fading bruise") avoids genericity. Emotional truth in fragile ache over revelation.</comment>
