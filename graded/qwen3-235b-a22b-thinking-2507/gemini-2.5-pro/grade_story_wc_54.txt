<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vague philosophical search into tangible problem," but "puzzle out new equations for hope" lacks embodied friction until sextant discovery. Final choice earned through diesel-fueled labor, though "rational disappointment" slightly over-articulates emotion mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the star chart's "hallowed glow" reweights the terminal's decay against Elara's earlier despair. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through density of sensory details (confetti, ozone, humming cables) culminating in the ceiling's resurrection without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sextant fragment and electro-chromic ceiling constrain choices and charge the final image: cables rerouted through baggage carousels to reactivate dead panels. "Dust motes dancing in sunbeams began to swirl" masterfully mirrors internal shift through environmental specificity, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—redirecting carnival generators to bypass dead power cores narrows options to a single high-stakes act. Cost is visceral: the "groaning generators" and "taut cables" preceding silence make the star chart's glow feel earned, though the carnival's role as resource supplier lacks earlier pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "hope isn't an equation but a current rerouted" crystallizes in the star chart's "hallowed glow" over confetti. Avoids moralizing by showing—never stating—the cost of rediscovering wonder, with the final datapad scene offering resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frequency she understood better than words" and "greasy napkin" details. Slight register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" phrasing during climax, but rhythmic control under pressure ("cables went taut, and for a moment, nothing happened") sustains immersion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, though "quiet hum of curiosity vibrated through her" risks cliché. High density throughout: "daisy-chaining generators across dusty baggage carousels" compresses action without loss. Final image’s "slow, magnificent wheel" avoids figurative muddle with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned terminal" trope through engineer’s lens: sextant fragment as nodal coordinate device feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—no confrontation, yet the star chart’s "galaxy seen from outside" delivers fresh emotional truth by reweighting carnival detritus as sacred.</comment>
