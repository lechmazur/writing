<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "condemn old ways... condemn them all to fade," with embodied cost (frantic pulse) justifying high score; no second character present so relationship bullets waived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: poised pen crystallizes extinction vs. hardship cost under Accumulative lens; "tiny star of potential" makes conceptual cost undeniable without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kingfisher quill (micro-setting) charges final image decisively, but obsidian spire/frozen lake remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; environment fails 9+ gate despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen's agency alone: "slow thaw not shattering flood" crystallizes trade-off with visible cost; Accumulative escalation peaks at pen's descent without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kingfisher metaphor and "adjacent possible" without moralizing; final image reweights "prevail not merely endure" as resonant non-literal answer to cultural stagnation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("groundedly imaginative," analytical engine hum) controls rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, lexicon stays within cartographer's plausible diction during high-stakes decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold in "title that amused court but sacred duty" slightly dulls immediacy; no loops or artifacts in closure beat preserving high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Ignorance Cartographer" transforms tropes through scientific rigor; risk-taking in quiet climax (pen descent) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
