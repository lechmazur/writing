<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "temporary rebellion" vs. "permanent" cure quest; embodied emotion in "discouragement seeping into bones" avoids labels. Final renunciation of hope-as-thing earned by rag knot’s functional beauty revealing pattern creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands: "heavy hush no longer feeling like an enemy... waiting for the first stroke" crystallizes stance shift with felt cost (months without smile). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via pattern-break escalation from ambient awareness to mosaic perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (rag knot’s "interwoven paths") constrains the climax choice, charging final image as "humble key." Sensory hierarchy excels: "scent of evaporated fuel" and "luminous flora" filter through designer’s professional bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: discouragement → knot discovery → pattern realization. Cost legible in "smile for first time in months," but "defy gravity of hopelessness" slightly abstracts the dominant stake’s visceral weight at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via rag knot’s "deliberate beauty" reweighting hope as pattern-making. Avoids moralizing by ending on "joyful chant," though "hope wasn’t a thing to be found" borders on stated concept; earns resonance through moon-petal mosaic mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "listening to fizz of a fuse" shapes noticing. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—chanted formulas shift from chemical to color as stakes rise. No POV slippage; tension in "playful, serious smile" embodies contradiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Filter the stone from the bloom" risks abstraction but saved by immediate sensory application. Minor scaffold in "he let his ambient awareness absorb" (could tighten to "he absorbed"). Final line’s rhythmic propulsion elevates closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hope as perceptual pattern (not magic) born from fireworks designer’s craft logic. Specificity in "dragon’s-breath red" and "blood-blossom moss" avoids trope. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off through rag knot’s earned reprise.</comment>
