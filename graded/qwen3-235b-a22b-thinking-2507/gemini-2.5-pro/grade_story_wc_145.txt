<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (professional doubt vs obsessive drive) embodied in micro-choices like trusting the phrasebook despite calling it "nonsense." Final endurance as archivist earns closure with visible cost to his identity as cartographer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric pressure buildup culminates in Charged Poise closure where conceptual cost (career rendered obsolete) crystallizes as rivers "remember their beginning." Orientation clear by 50 words; frost-map formation teaches the pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Window pane as micro-setting constrains choice and charges final image—condensation mechanics drive the entire climax. Sensory specificity ("milky fog," "feathery lines of frost") filters through Elias’s cartographer lens without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single tightening via atmospheric plunge narrows options to witness-only; conceptual cost (life’s work invalidated) legible in "a joke told by the universe." Agency shifts from seeking place to documenting phenomenon under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "water-veins" motif reweighted in frost-map climax. Final image ("rivers remembered their beginning") answers "where rivers begin" with conceptual cost—no moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration of Elias’s purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartographer’s precision ("fractal representation," "capillaries of ice") modulates into lyrical awe. Controlled psychic distance shifts ("he was no longer just an atlas editor") heighten the Charged Poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "delicate, feathery lines of frost" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One minor overwriting risk ("worrying tranquility" slightly abstract) avoided by concrete imagery. Final line’s "humming dark" charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "source of rivers" trope via hydro-geological phenomenon. Fresh synthesis: cartographer’s static maps vs. living watershed reconfiguration. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("polyglot’s phrasebook") anchors universals.</comment>
