<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fractured thing" vs. "tactfully hopeful") earned through embodied micro-choices like the ceremonial button preservation. Lacks contradictory impulses in final beat; Thomas backstory doesn't alter present tactics enough per BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("sorrow felt less like an ending") under Accumulative lens. Dust pattern discovery drives organic escalation, but lens ambiguity persists until midpoint (-0.3 penalty applied).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>File room micro-setting constrains choice (dust patterns guide discovery) and charges final image ("library of unknown histories"). Button's "cold weight" embodies cost, though emancipation timeframe lacks temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (unfurling paper reveals button), reweighting "magnify small kindnesses" with felt cost. Escalation lacks visceral stakes progression; sorrow-to-hope shift remains abstract despite chest-ache embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button's physicality ("love stubbornly tucked within its folds"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "unknown histories" as active preservation, not passive observation, with conceptual cost in the century-long echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archivist's perceptual signature ("dust patterns," "surgeon's precision") creates distinct voice. Slight register drift in "sundered families" clashes with profession, but rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during discovery) elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero template cadence; "brittle ledger" and "muffled click" exemplify textural specificity. Minor synonym loop ("fractured thing"/"broken heart") in para 1 triggers -0.2, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms artifact-discovery trope through dust-pattern mechanics and button's inscription. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, though core premise isn't radically fresh; earns risk distinction via Accumulative lens execution.</comment>
