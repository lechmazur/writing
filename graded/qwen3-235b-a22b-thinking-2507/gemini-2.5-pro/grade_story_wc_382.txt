<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clara’s embodied obsession ("grammar of groaning pipes") and contradictory impulses—craving truth yet clinging to comforting illusions—earn her rooftop confrontation. Elias’s underdevelopment as non-human entity slightly weakens micro-choices, though his role as building-memory crystallizes stakes. Final seal-pressing act embodies irreversible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density escalates via seal’s "louder whispers" to rooftop confrontation. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost—"lies gone, truth more beautiful"—as Clara accepts being "new librarian of whispers." Orientation anchors (Clara’s sugar shortage, Althea’s sigh) established by para 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Althea building functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: peeling wallpaper’s "pulse" teaches Clara, sun-bleached floor spot embodies memory, and rooftop ivy planter charges closure via seal impression. Rooftop meteor shower pressure crystallizes stakes—falling stars mirror transient lives held by building. Final image reweights setting as "collective soul."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. comforting illusions) tightens through Clara’s seal-aided perception shift: "curdle into need for truth" forces rooftop confrontation. Agency-driven escalation culminates in her asking "what are you?" with visible cost—shattered sanctuary ("agreed upon lies") for deeper responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "chipped plaster = forgotten argument," seal as "impressions how building remembers." Final seal-pressing offers non-literal answer—"keeper of silent epic"—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; truth’s "beauty" earns resonance via rooftop meteor imagery reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Clara’s architectural metaphors ("syntax of settling foundations") filter all observation. Voice modulates under pressure—"curdle into need" conveys rising urgency. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean ("she had to interrogate the source"). Rooftop dialogue carries subtext via meteor imagery as emotional conduit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("whisper, every floorboard a memory" compresses theme/setting). Final line risks sentimentality ("far more beautiful story") but earns it via concrete seal impression. Minor "contented sigh" cliché in para 1 avoids muddling closure. Rhythm varies naturally—"like celestial chalk marks" elevates imagery without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes ghost trope with architectural metaphor ("language of old buildings") for fresh emotional truth. Specificity elevates: Elias as "accumulated memory," not ghost, transforms familiar premise. Risk-taking (rooftop confrontation as closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Near-echo of "house as memory" tropes slightly caps originality despite strong execution.</comment>
