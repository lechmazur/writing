<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation (sacrificing the lens to harness the ephemeral while quelling grief) is concrete and drives pivotal action; embodied emotion ("luminous ache") avoids therapy-speak through sensory integration with the moon and lens. Micro-choices under pressure—ignoring cracks to listen for alignment—reveal contradictory impulses (save station vs. preserve memory) with visible cost in the frozen clock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: the station is saved but time stops ("never again mark the passing of another second"), reconfiguring stakes under a Causal lens. Pressure escalates through concrete cause-effect (vibrations→cracked window→lens insertion), with lunar zenith timing creating irreversible change. Orientation is clear by paragraph 1; lens coherence holds through the decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lens (micro-setting) constrains Elias' choice—its sacrifice anchors the clock at lunar zenith, charging the final image of the motionless hand pointing at the moon. Sensory details ("raw energy of the spinning hand," "dust settling") reflect urgency, while the observatory's lunar setting directly causes the gravitational harmonics crisis, avoiding postcard description through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias' agency under the Causal lens: vibrations intensify to a "violent crescendo" (window crack), forcing the lens sacrifice. The dominant stake (stop the clock or station collapses) tightens to a single choice with felt cost—eternal stasis—legible in the final image. No coincidence resolution; pressure narrows options to one irreversible act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "harness the ephemeral" literalizes in freezing time with the lens, avoiding moralizing. The final image (clock hand frozen at lunar zenith) resonates as a non-literal answer to loss—preserving a moment sacrifices time's flow—reweighting Elias' grief with conceptual cost. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "beautiful, silent prison."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound of a leaf falling" as internal timing) and rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during chaos ("He did not flinch") contrast serene focus earlier. Voice modulates with stress while maintaining Elias' scientist-poet lexicon; no head-hopping. Elision of backstory is taught through the lens photograph and paid off in the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("soft *click*, a sound as gentle and final as a memory settling") propels momentum. Final image ("motionless, pointing directly upwards at the serene, white face of the moon") avoids figurative muddle. Minor register drift in "luminous ache" (borderline abstract) costs 0.1, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms clock-stopping trope through photographic metaphor and lunar physics—Elias' lens expertise creates organic stakes. Emotional specificity in sacrificing the "perfect vessel" for grief avoids templates. Risk-taking (freezing time as solution/cost) heightens coherence without gimmickry; the "temporal escape velocity" concept feels fresh within the observatory's logic.</comment>
