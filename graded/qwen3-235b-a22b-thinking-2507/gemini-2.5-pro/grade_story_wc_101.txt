<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied emotion ("hollowed cheeks of children") and micro-choice to ring the bell (not ambush) reveal contradictory impulses. Slight deduction for "true motivation" line tipping toward summary rather than dramatized shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the final quiet reconfigured by "scrape of hoes" makes conceptual cost undeniable. Escalation via bell’s deepening meaning meets Accumulative lens with visible stakes reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s response location and charging the final seed offering. Bell’s physicality (palm-sized, etched lily) concretely anchors generational memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—donations evolve from sustenance to seeds/tools, driven by her bell declaration. Cost is felt in elders’ soil-starved hands, narrowing options toward intergenerational repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: bell’s chime unlocking memories, garden sounds replacing fear. Final image "planting its future" resonates without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("monochrome of want," "amplified quiet") modulates under stress. Syntax tightens during bell-ringing scene ("She did not hide or wait"), avoiding emotional ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("withered root vegetables" implying scarcity). Minor deduction for "tears to old ones’ eyes" cliché, but final paragraph’s "scrape of hoes" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "anonymous aid" trope through cultural specificity (lily-etched bell, heirloom seeds). Risk-taking in quiet closure feels inevitable, avoiding safety middle with sanctions-era nuance.</comment>
