<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kaelen’s shift from timeline to legacy arrangement, embodying his realization that meaning matters more than conflict. Phantom remains frustratingly opaque despite intentional design, slightly weakening the relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coordinate transforms the lagoon from memory to actionable truth with undeniable cost ("trembling fingers"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through debris arrangements deepening pressure without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains communication method (no voice) and charges the final image—the coordinate revelation. Zeppelin’s vibration provides crucial textural contrast but doesn’t directly pressure choices, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s agency when he abandons conflict-focused debris for legacy symbolism. Cost is legible in the coordinate’s burden: truth now demands physical pursuit ("true location"), altering tactics immediately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through debris language—"fragile cage" for legacy, seaweed as "benediction"—avoiding moralizing. Final coordinate reweights "what remains after struggle" as visceral responsibility, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in retrocognitive details ("spectral yet firm" hands, "soundless breath"). Compression taught early ("surrendering to the pull") pays off in seamless transitions without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sting of salt and heat of a forgotten sun" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "retrogradation" (vs. character’s lexicon) prevents 9.0 despite flawless rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent parley via beach debris applied to civil-rights archiving feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes (truth as physical location), though phantom’s opacity slightly dilutes emotional specificity.</comment>
