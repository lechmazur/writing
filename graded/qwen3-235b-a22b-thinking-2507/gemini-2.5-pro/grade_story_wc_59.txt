<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through micro-choices (resin selection, temperature doubts); flaw-driven obsession creates authentic stakes. Slight deduction as the egg's hybrid nature feels inevitable rather than earned by specific mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (mechanical world pausing), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens. The "quaking hands ceasing" crystallizes cost without resolution, perfectly calibrated for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices (salvaged brass, geothermal vent incubator), charging the final image. Cave lichen resin's phosphorescence evolves from detail to thematic anchor—environment shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen's hypothesizing (temperature/pulse doubts), narrowing options to the hatch moment. Cost—centuries of mechanical monotony interrupted—is viscerally felt when pistons "softened their hydraulic hiss."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hybrid creature's "bitterly sweet anthem," rejecting resurrection for resilient synthesis. Final image reweights "organic beauty" without moralizing—cost lies in the city's faltering gears, not Kaelen's epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescence of this piece," "scorched scraps of log") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control peaks in hatching scene: "crystalline beak chipped its way into the chilled air" compresses diction without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mosaic of cracks held by faintly glowing resin" achieves high density. Minor deduction for "fever dream of what-ifs" slightly abstracting emotion where embodied detail would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "resurrect extinct species" trope through flawed genesis—hybrid's living-metal heart and crystalline wings feel inevitable. Emotional specificity (bitter sweetness, not triumph) avoids generic templates.</comment>
