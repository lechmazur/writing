<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s refusal to carry the burden despite understanding it; micro-choices like gentle journal handling reveal her ethics. "A burden of knowing" label avoids therapy-speak through concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("leaving the ghosts to their ivy-veiled passage") under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by paragraph 1; "fractured chronicle" slight abstraction in setup doesn’t obscure pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and fireplace constrain discovery and charge closure—crumbling wall enables journal find, damp flagstones dictate silent movement. Final image’s "cold fireplace" reweights setting’s emotional burden without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (deciphering the wall’s "dream") tightens through textural accumulation: hum resolves into pacing/arguments. Renunciation cost ("not hers to carry") is palpable. Agency in leaving negative deepens rather than resolves, fitting Accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Prometheus" reframing from "seed of hope" to "contagion for the sky." Final image’s "A burden of knowing" offers non-literal answer without moralizing—scientist’s guilt lingers as environmental truth, not redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in acoustic framing ("sigh of settling dust," "hummed with anxiety"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical opening to staccato discovery ("She knelt," "She pulled," "She lifted"). Zero head-hopping; compression ("memory of rain") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ghostly reverse" description achieves high density without muddle. Only deduction: "fractured chronicle" slightly generic in setup, but doesn’t dull closure’s "cold fireplace" resonance. Propulsion flawless through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms climate fiction via acoustic lens—"corridor echo cartographer" synthesizes grief into fresh occupational truth. Bold quiet ending heightens stakes: refusal to absolve burden feels inevitable yet revelatory through prior particulars.</comment>
