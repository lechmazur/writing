<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "thistled calm" and precise micro-choices (angling vellum), but internal conflict during broadcast lacks one visceral layer of fear disrupting focus to reach 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: dust motes crystallize stakes with "clenching fear" as tangible cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, though cost could be slightly more embodied in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Radio glow and luminous ink constrain choices (inking requires specific light) and charge closure (dust vessels). Micro-setting transcends description to shape tactics and final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density (static → melody → blazing text) deepens under Accumulative lens. Cost ("clenching fear") is felt but slightly abstract; one physical tremor during broadcast would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "teach dust to tell stories" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to preservation's purpose, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("green shortwave dial glow," "thistled calm") reflects Elias' precision. Minor register drift: "lexicon of loss" slightly academic for his voice, though redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("a miniature aurora in the cramped dark"). "Clenching fear" borders on label but saved by "constant companion" concreteness. Final line's rhythm elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope via luminous ink mechanics. "Teach dust to tell stories" is fresh inflection that grows from Elias' copyist logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
