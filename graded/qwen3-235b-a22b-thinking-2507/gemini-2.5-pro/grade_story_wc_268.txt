<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("not vengeance but balance") but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "profoundly weary" remains told not tested under pressure despite elegant premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "his form grew translucent" crystallizes cost while constellations resume, fulfilling Accumulative lens with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrified wood floors and vellum scrolls constrain action (brushing the scroll triggers resonance); the ink pellet as micro-setting charges the final dissolution image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; off-page consequences ("crown would feel hollow") lack on-page pressure despite elegant premise and one tightening (pellet placement).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through concrete action (annotations → sundering) but lacks complexity; final image reweights "gilded falsehoods" without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence that belied his true nature") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, lyrical compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor "profoundly weary" label-speak avoided deeper embodiment but no loops or muddle in peak beats (pellet dissolution).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-weapon with cosmic stakes; "iron gall ink pellet" transforms trope through specific causality and charged dissolution.</comment>
