<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris lacks interior contradiction beyond professional duty; Elara’s embodied shift ("millstone" weight) earns high marks but single-note rationality caps near 8.8. Micro-choice (unfastening case) reveals value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (Elara’s resignation) crystallizes stance with undeniable cost: the vellum’s transfer forecloses her guardianship. Causal lens holds via Ashworth parallel tightening options. Cost proof: "weight seemed less like sacred burden" to "millstone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled station constrains choice (Aris’s suffocation metaphor directly alters Elara’s stance) and charges final image. Petal drop opener→ivy closure reweights lie’s decay. Micro-setting (leather case) embodies thematic cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Ashworth historical parallel (single causal escalation) forcing Elara’s trade-off: curated peace vs structural weakness. Cost legible in "resigned click" and document transfer. Agency-driven under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image (golden ‘V’ for Vindication replacing Valor) offers non-literal answer to "noble lies" question, reweighting truth’s necessity without moralizing. Theme emerges through vellum’s physical transfer, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively (Aris’s metronomic precision vs Elara’s paper-thin steadiness), but POV over-relies on historian’s clinical lens during climax. Perceptual signature strong yet lacks stress-induced syntax shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "crimson petal... silent syllable" risks overwriting but earns payoff in closure. "Hungry thing" metaphor maintains coherence. Slight register drift ("meticulous curator") in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "noble lie" trope transformed via historian’s emotionally rational method. Ivy suffocation metaphor avoids cliché by constraining Elara’s choice. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
