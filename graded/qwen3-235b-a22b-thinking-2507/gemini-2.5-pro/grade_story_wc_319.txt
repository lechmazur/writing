<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("waiting for home" vs protecting library) embodied through concrete micro-choices: pouring longing into pendant shows simultaneous desire/renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; "ache was no longer a void" crystallizes earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "no longer waiting for home" forecloses escape path through active renunciation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pendant's escalating whisper tightens pressure until final image ("peace with the fog") reconfigures meaning with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choice (Lyel won't "trade one cage for another") and charges closure: "gently swirling mist" reweights opening's "perpetual mist" from sorrow to acceptance. Sensory specificity ("skeletal roses," "ozone") avoids symbolic cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs guardianship) tightens through pendant's progression from "cold weight" to violent portal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his choice to "pour longing into it" actively smothers the signal, with cost legible in transformed ache ("no longer a void").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "interiorizing exteriors" concept, not statement. Final image ("waiting to see what the morning brings") reweights the garden's fog as active peace—not passive resignation—without moralizing. Avoids false binaries; home remains desirable but not worth betrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fog that clouded his memory of home" filters setting through Lyel's displacement. Rhythmic control shifts from languid ("long, slow act") to staccato ("burned with cold light") under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked in embodied sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean sky of his home" charges momentum without overwriting. Sentence rhythm varies ("He looked... then...") to mirror decision tension. Final line's "peace with the fog" crystallizes prior motifs with crystalline precision, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms portal fantasy trope through refusal-as-victory. Specificity ("cultist's pendant, twisted spiral of silver and obsidian") grounds metaphysical stakes. Emotional truth in choosing uncertainty over violent certainty feels inevitable, not contrived.</comment>
