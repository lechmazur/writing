<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied loss ("scent of his hair became threads"), but the name-void falter lacks prior struggle cues, slightly undercutting causality for the climax choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "hollow, cavern echoing with grief for a loss it couldn't name" crystallizes the irreversible sacrifice while the vanishing tapestry reconfigures the silence into wholeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loom’s "grooved wood" and amber bead constrain choices (thread cost, final placement), charging the ending’s "breathtaking map" with tangible, irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly through memory-threads (concrete losses like "cadence of his laugh"), culminating in the name-void’s devastating escalation that forces the final weave with palpable agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bead’s pulse and hollow heart: the final "wistful longing without context" resonates as a non-literal answer to love’s transcendence, avoiding moralizing through visceral absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("raveling silence," "gossamer connection") modulates rhythm under pressure; only minor syntactic repetition in reflection beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "stoically sparkling" in the bead description feels like a label rather than embodied detail, slightly muddling peak-beat specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "message in a bottle" through tangible mechanics of memory-loss; the loom’s price creates fresh emotional calculus where love’s transmission demands self-erasure.</comment>
