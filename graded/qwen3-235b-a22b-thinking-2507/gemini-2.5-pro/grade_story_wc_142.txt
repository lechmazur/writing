<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act concretely: Kael traces foundation stone while planning coded resistance, embodying "orderly intuition" vs. rage. Final endurance choice (not fighting) earns cost through visible inspector reaction. Slight therapy-speak in "dual allegiance pulling him apart" risks abstraction but redeemed by tactile stone chip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: inspector's departure crystallizes precarious survival with undeniable conceptual cost ("data-slate full of contradictions"). Accumulative lens holds—density of hidden patterns reweights stakes. Cost legible in "changed the story they would be told," avoiding abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Raft city constrains choices: barges enable Spray-Saints' tagging, fish market relocation alters tactics. Foundation stone chip charges final image ("familiar weight a comfort"), transforming relic into hope anchor. Sensory specificity ("calliope music, sizzling fry-oil") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency: inspector's early arrival tests coded system, narrowing options to endurance. Cost unmistakable in inspector's "confusion" and "data-slate full of contradictions," reweighting survival stakes. One deepening (graffiti efficiency) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: nebula mural's comet count = grain prices, serpent scales = market map. Final image ("desperate hope painted bright") reweights gentrification without moralizing, embracing complexity—survival requires sacrificing chaos for coded order.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Kael notices "paths through river of bodies," "patterns where should be noise." Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during inspector scene ("She left without a word") mirror tension. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in peak beats ("heart a frantic drum"). "Desperate hope painted bright" avoids cliché through context. Sentence variety supports rhythm: "He felt the torment... But the orderly part" shifts cadence for internal conflict.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via specific method (graffiti as secret ledger). Fresh inflection: chaos as hidden order. Stone chip motif feels inevitable, avoiding symbolic convenience. Risk-taking (coded art as resistance) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
