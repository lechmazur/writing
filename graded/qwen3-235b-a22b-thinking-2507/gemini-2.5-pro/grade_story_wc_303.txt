<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (prestige vs truth) act simultaneously in the coffee-stain moment; final choice earned by vine memory convergence. Slight tell in "polishes thrones" backstory fragment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("trading an empire for a single green stem"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory layering; time pressure tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choice: refrigerated air necessitates coffee warmth, Cyphandra vine enables telepathy. Final "velvet cage" image recharges velvet drape motif with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (reading stains, interpreting vine) under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "mulberry ache" transforming to "fertile pang" as he walks away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (cutting in hand, "wounded soil") offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing. "Perforated destiny" concept reweights empire's narrative through coffee stain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mulberry ache," "leafy ghosts") with rhythmic control. Stress compresses diction ("burgeoning light") without voice drift; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("bittersweet sorrow of a man who polishes thrones"). Final line’s "fertile pang" recharges opening ache with precise textural cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice violin as "tear frozen into music" transforms conquest trope. Risk-taking (coffee prophecy) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic resistance.</comment>
