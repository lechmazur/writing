<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (artist/surgeon) manifest in micro-choices like tightening grip on emerald during infusion; final preservation choice earned through prior causality with visible cost in vanished soul outline and aurora's shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: locket closure crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("silence filled not with emptiness, but preserved beauty"), sustained under Accumulative lens where pattern density escalation forecloses the soul's dissolution path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto functions as active micro-setting; aurora's static directly pressures Elara's work (source of harvestable vibrations), while emerald chip constrains choices and charges final locket image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: soul's fraying state narrows temporal option window, forcing precision in pattern-finding; cost legible in vanished outline and aurora's softening waltz, reweighting memory preservation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through preserved sparks' accumulation; final image reweights "radiant hush" as defiant beauty against oblivion without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while sustaining conceptual cost of eternal fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("felt vibrations against consciousness") with rhythmic control; compression in ritual taught early, voice modulates from cosmic symphony to focused "There. A flicker..." under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid light" metaphor coherently merges with physical action during infusion beat, while final line achieves high density ("radiant hush... preserved beauty") without muddling closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Beautician mortician" transforms death rituals through specific memory-harvesting mechanics; risk-taking (pure interiority, no dialogue) heightens emotional stakes coherently, synthesizing familiar concepts into fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
