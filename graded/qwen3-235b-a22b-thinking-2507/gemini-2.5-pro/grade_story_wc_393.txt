<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arthur's embodied guilt ("leaden heart") and micro-choices (placing the heart) ground interiority, but Thorne's backstory summary lacks dramatized contradiction. Diagnostic slip: "felt the old, useless weight" edges toward therapy-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (sunlight reweighting forgiveness) lands with conceptual cost, but Arthur's guilt-to-peace shift lacks sufficient struggle. Non-closure accumulation: two distinct issues (cost ambiguity + backstory weight) trigger -1.5 cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shop functions as micro-setting: the clockwork heart and storm light actively constrain choices, charging the final image. "Molten silver" puddles transform cliché into visceral metaphor that reconfigures the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (deserving forgiveness) tighten through Elias's metaphor, but Arthur's realization lacks visible price—guilt dissipates without enduring cost. Meets escalation minimum via textural density shift, but band guardrail denies 8.8+ for cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clockwork-as-lockbox metaphor; final image ("looking for cracks") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo by embedding insight in concrete action ("show them where light gets in").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes, ancient and golden") modulates with pressure, but "vibrant hush" and "felt hammers" risk overwritten cadence. Rhythmic control under stress earns high band despite one filter verb ("he felt") in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "spear of sunlight... molten silver" demonstrates textural specificity with propulsion. Single filter verb ("he felt") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle—every image serves closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms prison chaplain trope via clockwork heart metaphor ("not a replacement for a soul, but a lockbox"). Emotional specificity elevates familiar premise, but "light through storm clouds" leans on conventional imagery without full reinvention.</comment>
