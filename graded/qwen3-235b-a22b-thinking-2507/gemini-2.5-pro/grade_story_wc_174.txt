<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (serene exterior vs tremor of doubt), but Elara's absence weakens relationship crucible; micro-choice with hollow-eyed man reflection earns the pivotal reversal with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via Accumulative lens: stars piercing twilight crystallize reconfigured stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("vivisectionist" doubt → dawn-pointing purpose), though hollow-eyed man feels slightly convenient as doubt-trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Decommissioned dome's "meteor hush" functions as vital micro-setting, constraining perception and charging closure; story stick's ancestral weight directly shapes Kaelen's final decision, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from artistic method ("shadows not truth") to ethical responsibility through reflection on audience impact; one tightening (doubt → reversal decision) narrows options with visible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "half-lit epiphanies" reweighted by final dawn-pointing image avoids moralizing; Elara's accusation becomes earned complexity rather than simplistic binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calligrapher’s precision" lens) and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register risk with "conceptual repricing"-level terms stays character-bound through embodied doubt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush" metaphor sustains density without muddle; final line ("point toward the dawn") crystallizes closure with perfect propulsion and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist's dilemma through radar dome's hush and story stick; emotional specificity in "hollow-eyed man" reflection transforms trope, with risk-taking quiet closure heightening stakes.</comment>
