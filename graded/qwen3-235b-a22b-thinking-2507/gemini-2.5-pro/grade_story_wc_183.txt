<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices (clutching swatch card, trembling hand), but "blissfully aberrant peace" edges toward abstraction without sufficient physical anchoring in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "He had never had a name to be forgotten" crystallizes the conceptual cost with the muted swatch card image, under Accumulative lens where density escalation forecloses her quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting, constraining every choice (carousel horse, gate, console) and charging the final image where "vibrant greens now seemed muted," proving indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency-driven swatch applications, tightening options until the womb memory's conceptual cost ("cellular surrender") irrevocably alters her stance, with visible dissolution of her memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through swatch card mechanics—Garden shifts from sought place to memorial she builds—avoiding moralizing; final line "She would be his story" reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends medical and carnival decay ("ghost of her brother within her cells"), though "blissfully aberrant" slightly drifts from embodied lexicon during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("memories felt like watercolor paintings left in the rain") propels momentum without muddle, even in the pivotal womb-memory sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "twin" trope through cellular absorption and swatch card mechanics; the carnival ship's decay becomes organic to the memory-recapture premise, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
