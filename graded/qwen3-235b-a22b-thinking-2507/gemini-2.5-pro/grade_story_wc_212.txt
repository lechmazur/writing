<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; "furiously tranquil" embodied well yet motivation remains abstract without tangible struggle against flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("fragile existence"), though causal escalation falters—no meaningful tightening narrows options before resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: dissolving memory shards pressure choices, while final "clear panes" charge closure by reflecting restored order—environment constrains action throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally (chaos density → wild serenity) but lack visible cost; "fragile existence" implies conceptual price without on-page forfeiture altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "living water over stone" image—a resonant answer to "borrowed time" without moralizing—though conceptual cost feels slightly abstract at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen fractals," "snowflakes on warm tongue") with rhythmic control; voice modulates perfectly from frantic vortex to "thunderstorm held still in rain."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shards dissolve against icy walls like snowflakes on warm tongue" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final "tranquil and complete" skirts sentimentality but saved by concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "heirloom" as living reality, but "decreasing entropy" method feels underexplored; risk-taking elevates stakes yet lacks one transformative intensification beyond premise.</comment>
