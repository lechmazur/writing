<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (obedience mask vs revolutionary action) drive every beat; "tremor in his own veins" embodies tension without labels. Final choice to slip away earns revolution with visible cost in dismantled authority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes revolution’s success with undeniable cost: "unaware their authority had just been dismantled" proves conceptual price paid. Causal lens holds perfectly from blackout cue to light signals altering power.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Luminous fort’s algae walls and sundial aren’t backdrop—they constrain choices (coded angles, light-node signaling) and charge the final image ("lights wink back"). Micro-setting (sundial) directly enables the cradle of sparks activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blackout tightens tactics by creating cover for Kael’s action; one meaningful escalation (turning quill → light signals → system shifts) forecloses Warden’s authority with felt cost. Stake crystallization is pure protagonist agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolution emerges through light-signaling mechanics, not statement. Final image reweights "silent promise" as earned reality, avoiding moralizing while resonating with conceptual cost of dismantled authority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("winking hush," "pearlescent light") and rhythmic control under pressure ("For a moment, nothing happened") modulate tension. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure’s crystalline moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tremor in his own veins" shows not tells. Final line ("lights wink back... silent promise") crystallizes closure with unmatched density. Figurative language never obscures cause/effect in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms revolution trope through light-based signaling system; "cradle of sparks" as dormant network feels specific, not derivative. Synthesis of algae fort + sundial code creates fresh emotional truth in silent takeover.</comment>
