<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embodied trauma response excels ("ice bloomed in her stomach"), but "somatic markers" triggers diagnostic label penalty. Micro-choices like soil-grit focus show authentic contradiction without therapy-speak, though husband backstory edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the past was real, and the sky would always hold potential menace" crystallizes stance with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to the watering can's decisive refocusing of agency without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Arboretum constrains choice literally (paralyzed hand near pine) and thematically (Wollemi as survival metaphor). Soil grit and pine resin become active tools for grounding, charging the final watering image with geological weight against technological menace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single escalation via drone-triggered freeze narrows options to endurance, with cost visible in "joints aching from sudden tension." Agency in choosing present-moment focus reweights the dominant stake (trauma vs. nurturing life) under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: watering "just enough" reweights "anchoring optimism in realism" without moralizing. The Wollemi pine’s ice-age survival mirrors Anya’s endurance, offering resonant answer to "how to tend life amid menace" through concrete horticultural care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress ("sound of geology, not technology"), with rhythm modulating from flowing calm to staccato panic. Only flaw: "somatic markers" slightly violates POV lexicon, but compression in crisis feels authentic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper soft as cloth from years of being clenched" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language avoids muddle even in peak panic ("high, thin whine... amplified to a scream"), with propulsion through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms trauma narrative through botanist’s lens: Wollemi pine’s cataclysm survival reframes PTSD as ecological endurance. Avoids stock tropes via horticultural specificity ("single, stubborn leaf"), with risk-taking in quiet climax that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
