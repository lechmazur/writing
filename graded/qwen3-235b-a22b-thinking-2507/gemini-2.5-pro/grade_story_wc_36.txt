<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied flaw ("shard of ice," "hammer not needle") drives the epiphany; contradictory impulses (purpose vs. failure) act simultaneously in the flute-playing beat. Minor deduction for "avalanchingly quiet" bordering on overwritten texture under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the "single agonizingly clear note of truth" reconfigures his entire worldview, with the canyon absorbing both grief and understanding. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory density escalation to the shimmering climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon actively constrains choice (driftwood alignment with "unseen currents") and charges the final image; the flute’s "gilded" simplicity becomes the micro-setting that crystallizes the epiphany. Environment isn’t backdrop but causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: arranging driftwood (preparation) → playing the "question" (action) → insight (consequence). Cost is visceral—his identity as guardian shatters—but single deepening limits escalation complexity for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the flute’s shift from "command" to "weaving" embodies the harmony insight. Final image ("canyon held his grief, and now, his understanding") reweights the opening "cathedral of stone" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geological metaphors, tactile verbs like "soft hiss") modulates under stress with rhythmic compression ("He played another, and another"). No POV leakage; lyric density taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "avalanchingly quiet" repetition slightly muddies peak-beat clarity but serves motif cohesion. Final line’s "gilded flute resting silently" achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "failed guardian" trope through specific mechanics (driftwood as directional markers, flute as "needle not hammer"). Emotional truth in "harmony vs. force" insight feels earned, not derivative.</comment>
