<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (firefighter vs. arsonist's daughter) act simultaneously in the graft scene; final choice to sever the coin earns endurance with visible cost ("vibrant color a stark promise"). No therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "soot-smudged face" and "calm sharpened." Micro-choice of using thread over medical tape reveals value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: coin abandoned for graft reconfigures legacy ("severance and synthesis"). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies through "weeping gashes" to "scars can sing," narrowing options to one living bond. Cost legible in "fallen silently into blackened soil" foreclosing paternal inheritance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (coin thread) constrains choice: its repurposing from dead symbol to living bond charges the final image. Obsidian lagoon’s "kelp-drift peace" evolves from passive reflection to active "water settling into new level," mirroring her stance. Sensory specificity ("acrid smoke," "charcoal bark") filters through firefighter’s priorities without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewriting inheritance) tightens via grafting act, narrowing options to one irreversible choice. Agency-driven escalation: her "unyielding compassion" forces focus on the tree despite perimeter firefighting. Cost is visible in abandoned coin and soot-smudged endurance, though cloud timeframe lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through graft’s "impossible hope," not moralizing. Final image of black sand as "promise of what could be built" reweights "fire’s end" without stating morals. Avoids thematic echo—no character articulates "scars can sing"; it’s earned through concrete action and the thread’s transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "ghost ship on glassy sea" reflects firefighter’s trained observation. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during fire ("Smoke billowed..."), lyrical flow at lagoon. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats ("kelp-drift peace settled... as water settling").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; high density ("vibrant color a stark promise against charcoal bark"). Figurative language serves pressure: "weeping gashes" intensifies without muddle. Minor register drift in "bruised twilight" (slightly overused) prevents 9.5, but closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter’s grafting skill recontextualizes arsonist legacy into healing. Emotional specificity in "confusing relic" coin avoids trope. Risk-taking (using thread, not medical tape) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure’s "scars can sing" feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
