<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "inadvertently stubborn" resolve born of desperation; embodied exhaustion ("weariness etched deeper than lines") avoids therapy-speak. Final silence earned through prior causality with palpable cost in "cold, wet sand" settling. No second character present, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: lens installation forecloses the noise with felt cost in "lifetime" of weariness resolving. Accumulative/Textural lens holds (pressure builds through sensory density), but lens ambiguity past midpoint caps score. Cost proof solid via "profound, unambiguous relief of silence" crystallizing the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lens shard) constrains choices: its fracture dictates installation method, and the ocean’s "crushing black" pressure charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy masterful—salt-stained box, seaweed, coral astrolabe—filtered through undertaker’s tactile worldview. No white-room syndrome; environment actively shapes tactics during the non-space traversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending psychic noise) tightens via lens installation, narrowing options to a single decisive act under Accumulative lens. Agency is clear but constrained—Elias’s "folding the world" choice alters tactics with cost in "thousand silent screams." Escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-beat (e.g., physical toll during traversal), slightly muddying cost legibility despite strong closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "distress signals" become "tapestry of tranquil history" through action, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "chased stillness" as earned silence without stating a moral. No thematic echo—epiphany arises from concrete particulars (stone tablets, astrolabe hum). Complexity preserved: rest requires brokenness, not repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: undertaker’s tactile focus ("dry seaweed," "warm in his hand") and funereal lexicon ("mausoleum," "final pages") persist under pressure. Rhythmic control elevates tension—"water parting not as liquid, but as tear in reality." Filter verbs minimal; no head-hopping. Slight register drift in "psychic static" risks cliché but redeemed by specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("spiderweb of despair" conveys fracture and emotion). Propulsion flawless: "He did not dive, but rather folded..." accelerates the turn. Figurative language precise—no muddle in peak beats. Final line’s "work... done" recharges "permanent address" motif with earned simplicity. Minor deduction for "frayed edges of his world" (near-cliché).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: supernatural distress signals grounded in undertaker’s profession, avoiding tropey ghost tropes. Emotional specificity in "crushing depth and profound silence" transcends genre. Risk-taking (lyric underwater traversal) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative guardrail avoided—lighthouse/library trope transformed via concrete stakes (stone tablets awaiting souls).</comment>
