<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "steely longing replacing grief," but "strategically creative" remains label-only until film use; micro-choices like studying glitches reveal values without therapy-speak. Flaws drive action but lack earlier complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping through the portal crystallizes options with visible cost (abandoned piano/clock). Causal lens holds perfectly—film glitches directly enable the solution to compass failure, with cost anchored in "final, resolute glance" at the frozen clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal arbor’s "strange physics" actively enables the portal, while the film reel’s physicality (monochrome frames against twilight) charges the climax. Micro-setting constraints tactics: piano keys translate visual code into sonic keys, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten viscerally when compasses flicker, forcing Elian’s agency: playing the film is a direct response to collapsing pathways. Cost is unmistakable—"leaving his piano behind" crystallizes sacrifice, with "horizon invites night" pressure driving the irreversible choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: film glitches as navigational seams reweight "refuge" without moralizing. Final image (stepping through) offers resonant answer to "surprising fate," avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musician translates visual glitches into staccato notes. Rhythmic control peaks in "brute-force attack" crescendo, with compression taught early (film study) and paid off in sonic translation—zero head-hopping, voice modulates under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rectangle of pure, silent-film white" delivers high density without muddle. Final line recharges "unplanned encore" motif, while "ozone and old celluloid" smell avoids cliché. Minor abstraction in "steely longing" redeemed by embodied action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film glitches as navigational tools feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (non-literal reality manipulation) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional specificity in "picnics in sun-drenched, impossible fields" avoiding generic templates.</comment>
