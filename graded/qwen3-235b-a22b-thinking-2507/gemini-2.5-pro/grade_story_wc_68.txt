<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Silas' resignation ("not defeated, only resignedly certain") amid futility, with micro-choices like cleaning the cog revealing his hierarchy of values. Lacks visceral embodiment of his "cold ache" beyond intellectual acknowledgment, slightly muting the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Silas' refusal to teach crystallizes with conceptual cost ("he was its memory"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation delayed to ~100 words (sewer perch), narrowly avoiding penalty but limiting Q2's peak potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (hours of cleaning) and charging the final image (velvet-lined box). Sensory details like "chalky residue of dissolved plaster" filter through Silas' engineer-archivist bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the girl's rejection forces Silas' realization ("barrenness of the soil"), foreclosing conversion with felt cost. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, but the plague's aftermath lacks causal pressure on immediate decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cog's reweighted meaning: final image ("calmly, stubbornly, remember") offers non-literal answer to "for whom?" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical interiority, with ambiguity in whether preservation matters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "teeth of breathtakingly fine pitch" and "sedimentary layers of muck," with syntax tightening during stress ("A scraping sound echoed... Silas stiffened"). Slight register drift in "dispassionate contempt" risks over-articulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density ("peeling back strata of collapse") with rhythmic propulsion, but scaffold weakens momentum: "his philosophy one of stark, material truth" tells rather than shows. Final line ("calmly, stubbornly, remember") achieves crystalline closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic trope through specific emotional truth ("librarian in a world that forgot the alphabet"). Fresh synthesis of intellectual futility and quiet endurance, though "Sun-Kissed" nomenclature risks slight derivative familiarity without deeper cultural texture.</comment>
