<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "breathtaking, impossible arrogance" amid bruised awe, with embodied micro-choices like tracing the puppet's smile. Slight therapy-speak risk in "bruised awe" offset by concrete wood/cheek contact. Final endurance earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "last echo of the lullaby in his own fading consciousness" amid drained energy. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via density increase in lullaby translation. Orientation clear by line 3 with lighthouse/dusk stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal pane and puppet function as micro-setting, constraining choices (translation medium) and charging final image (dissolving pane, held puppet). Sensory specificity ("thrum between atoms," "splintered wood to cheek") avoids white-room syndrome while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("whisper lullaby across lifetimes") tightens through Elias's agency in pattern-weaving under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable as energy essence drains into the pane—visible in "light began to dim" and "ragged, satisfied sighs" foreclosing his path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: invisible peace woven into despair. Final image (white silence, puppet held close) reweights "doomsday" as gentle gift without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring wisdom in concrete acts—"sudden calm in heart of storm" earned through translation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in atomic-thrum awareness and wood-grain intimacy. Rhythmic control under pressure: shortening syntax at climax ("The hum quieted"). Minor abstraction in "breathtaking arrogance" redeemed by physical immediacy of "fingertips on crystal."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "stitching solace into wounds of past" does triple duty. Near-label slip ("breathtaking, impossible arrogance") triggers -0.3 penalty but redeemed by tactile follow-up. Zero loops; final line recharges motif without cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: doomsday as gentle tide, peace as invisible gift. Tropes transformed via specific mechanics (lullaby → fractal light) and emotional truth ("bruised awe"). Risk-taking in quiet apocalypse heightens stakes without gimmickry, though lighthouse setting leans generic.</comment>
