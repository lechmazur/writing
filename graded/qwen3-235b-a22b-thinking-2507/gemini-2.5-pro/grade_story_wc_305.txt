<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("worry tried to reclaim") and embodied emotion ("warmth spread through her chest") anchor motivation; hairpin's shift from memento to tool reveals hierarchy of values under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "she had not discovered... she had become it" reweights contentment through action; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds to scalloping's decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (soil, hairpin) constrains choice: scalloping grooves directly alter water flow; "vineyard hush" evolves from waiting to "thriving purpose," charging the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: dimming Heart-Bloom forces trade-off between observation and intervention; cost legible in "hesitation dissolving" and prior "unlearned" worry's return under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: contentment as "taking part" crystallizes via scalloping, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights search ("not discovered... became it") without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "basalt and mist") filters sensory detail; rhythmic control under pressure ("sluggishly pooling water" to "trickled down") avoids syntactic monotony while modulating intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("carved elegant, overlapping curves") with concrete propulsion; single metaphor ("seed seeking light") earns payoff without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "contentment as participation" avoids self-help tropes; grotto's above-clouds specificity grounds universals; risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
