<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied jealousy of past selves ("phantom ache," "bitter taste"), but the epiphany shift from resentment to awe lacks micro-choice escalation in the trance sequence, slightly unearthing causality for the final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "breathless... heart hammering" crystallizes cost of losing feral nostalgia, with the scroll's repurposing reconfiguring options under Accumulative/Textural lens through density escalation to the flight vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll constrains choices (crumbling charcoal halting writing) and charges the final image (steady hand remapping chaos), while cabin's "knots like staring eyes" evolves from oppressive to irrelevant through the flight sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening density—jealousy peaks into "something snapped"—drives agency toward the flight vision, with the visceral cost of nostalgia's dissolution ("feral nostalgia was gone") unmistakably legible in the breathless aftermath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the flight metaphor's reprise: "points on a single sprawling map" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to fragmentation without moralizing, reweighting the scroll's purpose from survival to artistry in the final lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in stress ("dust motes thick with sunlight," "wind tore at my clothes"), with rhythmic control shifting from fragmented clauses during jealousy to soaring cadences in the vision, taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dry whisper," "wild symphony against silence" achieves high density without muddle, and the final line's "fractured narrative... but it was mine" crystallizes theme with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-confusion trope through specific emotional calculus—jealousy of scraped-knee boy as visceral hunger—and risks lyrical structure where the flight vision reconfigures stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
