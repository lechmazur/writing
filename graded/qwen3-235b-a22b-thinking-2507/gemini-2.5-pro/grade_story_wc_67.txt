<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory role (deceiver/healer) and Kael's embodied fragility anchor choices, but limited interiority in short form prevents 9.0. Key omission: Kael's grief lacks specific sensory memory beyond portfolio clutch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost (the "exquisite mirage" Elara recognizes). Accumulative lens holds: each ritual step deepens the central stake without causal breaks. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rocking chair functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's decision (timing the scatter), charging the final image. Gallery's sensory details (charcoal dust, porcelain light) are selective but don't actively pressure choices beyond the chair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (temporary peace vs inevitable grief return) tightens through Elara's curated omissions. Kael's urn tilt is agency-driven under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in Elara's "heavy, knowing stone" heart as he scatters ash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the mask's gold veins reprise as "exquisite mirage," the ash scatter crystallizes "fleeting illusion of peace." No moralizing; final image reweights opening "crystallize a fleeting emotion" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("charcoal dust clinging like second skin," "winter light slanting"). Elara's dialogue avoids therapy-speak; Kael's fragility shown through physicality ("knuckles white"). Minor drift: "hollowed by grief" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("a tear traced a path through the dust on Kael's cheek"). Final line ("fleeting illusion of peace to hold against the night") crystallizes theme without overwriting. Slight purple risk in "grief so vast" offset by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual trope through specific, risky choices: the mask's suicide omission, "crystallization" as destructive act. Rocking chair timing innovates "perfect equilibrium" concept. Avoids sentimentality by showing Elara's complicity as essential.</comment>
