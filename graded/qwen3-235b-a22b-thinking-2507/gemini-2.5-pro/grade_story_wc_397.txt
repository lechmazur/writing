<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s euthanasia-tourist motivation drives authentic micro-choices (trawling debris, clutching parasol tip), with embodied contradiction in seeking endings while delaying her own. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "grips reality loosely" manifests in tactile debris-sorting. Final calm earns endurance without over-tidiness, though secondary flaw depth slightly lacks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ice-calving sound crystallizes "dignified severance" with conceptual cost ("profound calm settled in her chest"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via debris density and patience "folds"—but escalation lacks one visceral mid-beat cost escalation beyond sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting: splintered docks and tidal surge constrain Elara’s trawling, while the parasol tip (recurring object) charges the final image. Sensory details ("salt and diesel fuel," "sodden novel cover") mirror internal drift without overt symbolism, meeting 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings’ sound) tightens through Elara’s agency—trawling debris, enduring "taut humming wire" patience—until ice-calving reweights options. Cost is unmistakable: her comprehension ("That was the sound") forecloses searching, with calm as earned renunciation. Escalation driven entirely by protagonist under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice-calving’s "resonant sigh," rejecting violent endings for dignified release. Final image ("calm settled in her chest, vast and quiet as the ice") offers non-literal answer to "sound of approaching endings" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars (parasol tip, debris), achieving 9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elara’s "muted and thin" world filters details ("praying hands" masts, "clipped-off sentences" debris). Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("sighing crackle, a thousand crystalline heartbeats"), with elision (past life) taught early. Zero POV drift; voice modulates from methodical to awe-struck without cliché.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose excels in texture ("bruised apricot" ice floes) and propulsion, but "fold in patience" metaphor slightly overworks conceptual density in one beat. No loops or scaffold; final image’s clarity offsets minor abstraction ("resonant reconfiguration"). Near-flawless except for one elevated phrase ("inexorable drift") bordering register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tropes through disaster-relief framing and ice-calving epiphany. Fresh inflection: endings as "sigh of release," not violence. Specificity ("tarnished parasol tip," "euthanasia tourist") avoids genericity, but risk-taking stays conceptual without structural boldness—missing the +0.5 uplift for 9.5+.</comment>
