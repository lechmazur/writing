<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Elara seeks silence yet the noise becomes cosmic song. Epiphany earned through tracing action, not therapy-speak. Final choice to draw faces shows meaningful change with visible cost—lifelong torment transformed but not erased.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under accumulative lens: rest redefined as "resonant harmony" forecloses her escape quest. Cost is palpable in "shadowed rapture recede, burned away," though immediate consequence could be sharper in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass instrument functions as micro-setting—constrains choices via "fine-toothed gears" and "diamond stylus," then charges closure when pushed aside for charcoal. Final stone canvas evolves from passive surface to active creation tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density: psychic noise transforms from "crushing static" to "cosmic plainsong" via protagonist’s tracing action. Agency crystallizes when she reconfigures suffering as song, with cost legible in "fear, anger, sorrow" becoming part of the hymn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stardust metaphor—no moralizing. Final image of sketching faces answers "lament of forgotten stardust" with "verses of her new song," reweighting torment as beauty without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterful: "grinding friction of unspoken resentments" embodies her affliction. Under stress, syntax compresses ("to rest. And her method..."), avoiding uniform tics. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "it was this relentless noise that had driven her here" costs 0.1. "Ghostly fire" borders purple but serves pressure; no loops or metaphor muddle. Final charcoal/stars imagery delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" transforms cosmic cliché into matter’s "lament," avoiding safety middle. Emotional specificity in "brittle fear of a child" grounds universality. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
