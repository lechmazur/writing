<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aris's "fiercely gentle" desperation; offering his academy memory embodies earned change with visceral cost ("phantom joy that now belonged to no one"). No diagnostic labels, only embodied grief and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sapling touching femur crystallizes options with felt cost (drained tension, sacrificed memory). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through shadow attack forcing memory offering, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains choices: marrow-rich soil enables growth, bones supply nutrients, shadows threaten roots. Final image (sapling on femur) charges closure—setting isn't backdrop but active participant in the soul-patching logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (void in Elara's soul) materializes viscerally when shadow "trammels" roots. Aris's agency drives escalation—rejecting violence to offer memory narrows options with visible cost (erased joy), reweighting stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "fill emptiness one piece at a time" crystallizes in final image without moralizing. Burned tarot's reweighting (failure → guard stone) offers non-literal answer to "bartered destinies" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("skeletal shadows," "hollow ache") filters all detail through Aris's grief. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Panic... rose... but he swallowed it down"), showing rhythmic control that heightens pressure without muddying causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line charges momentum. "Phosphorescent moss casting long, skeletal shadows" achieves density without clutter. Final line recharges "inlaying meaning" motif with crystalline precision, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "bartered destiny" trope via specific mechanics: void as shadow requiring memory-filling, not fighting. Emotional specificity in "phantom joy" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in quiet closure (no fix, only progress) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
