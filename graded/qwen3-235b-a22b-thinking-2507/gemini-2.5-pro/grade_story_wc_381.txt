<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "tranquil blaze" feels like stock metaphor rather than embodied emotion under pressure. No micro-choices beyond ritual execution, missing the required conflicting impulses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("fragile blanket laid over a dangerous fire"), satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3, but cost legibility slightly softens impact—needs one more concrete image of fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook and origami wing function as micro-setting: brook establishes noise baseline, wing channels power, both charge final image. "Simple, clean sound of the brook" reweights prior tension with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through silence expansion under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("fragile blanket") without visceral physical or relational price. Agency drives pressure, yet cost lacks the felt immediacy required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "secrets... now asleep" and "fragile blanket" reweight prophecy’s danger without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to silencing fear through quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listen past [brook’s sound] to trembling network"), but "tranquil blaze" and "profound stillness" drift toward abstraction under pressure. Rhythm modulates well with scene intensity despite minor lexical slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with "cool and heavy like river stone" exemplifying textural specificity, but "profound and overwhelming peace" triggers abstraction loop. Zero scaffold, though "tranquil blaze" borders on mixed metaphor without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" transforms prophecy trope through concrete method; brook-to-quiet final image feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "solitary summoner" archetype slightly dilutes freshness.</comment>
