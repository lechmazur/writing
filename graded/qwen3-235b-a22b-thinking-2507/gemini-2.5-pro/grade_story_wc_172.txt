<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices (kneeling in sharp salt, trembling hands) but "secretly sentimental" reflection is tell, not show-driven. Final renunciation earned by boyhood memory's cost, though memory itself lacks scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "an entire lineage unwritten in a silent, shimmering bloom" crystallizes the hollow resonance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "map drawn by cracks" to final dissolution without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt flat micro-setting actively constrains the climax: hyper-saline brine's corrosiveness enables the egg's dissolution, charging the final image. "Heat was a physical weight" exemplifies sensory hierarchy where crisis narrows perception to visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single deepening (egg dissolving) reweights stakes through Elias' agency: "preserve the echo" transforms from abstract desire to microbial surrender. Thunder's return as "promise of rain that was both his creation and curse" makes conceptual cost unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment>Theme emerges purely through action—dissolution as "fractured grace"—avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "music" without stating theme, though "library of song" risks abstraction before concrete dissolution proves its necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("thunder that had stalked," "heat was a physical weight"), but "secretly sentimental" disrupts voice with tell. Under stress, syntax compresses effectively ("He knelt... gazed") yet maintains rhythmic control through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "mineral ghost of the ocean" demonstrates multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction for "fractured his iron resolve" bordering stock metaphor, but final dissolution sequence achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms eco-grief trope through specific execution: selling water while seeking sonic preservation, dissolution as rebirth. Salt flat's microbial soup as resurrection medium feels fresh, though "fractured grace" risks thematic echo without the egg's concrete surrender.</comment>
