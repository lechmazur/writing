<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation and embodied emotion (e.g., "panic, cold and sharp"), but lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; micro-choices under pressure remain surface-level despite credible endurance in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("a quiet, internal fire now his to guard"), but the inversion's causal chain slightly overshadows the thematic stakes' immediacy at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's inverted physics actively constrains movement (e.g., "feet finding purchase on surfaces no normal man would walk"), and the vellum scrap's evolution from tool to extinguished relic charges the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gravity inversion creates urgent pressure, but the intellectual plague stakes remain abstract; physical danger dominates, diluting the conceptual cost's visceral impact during the equation retrieval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" theme resonates through concrete action (memorizing the synthesis), but the "intellectual plague" motivation lacks sufficient dramatization to fully charge the final burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-mind refracted it") shines, though "latent blaze" slightly drifts into abstract diction during high-pressure moments, risking voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle ("latent blaze... hummed") and a paraphrase loop near the climax slightly dull propulsion; otherwise, high density and rhythmic control anchor the escape sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted physics and cognitive archiving transforms tropes, though the "chosen guardian" premise risks familiarity without the grotto's tangible constraints.</comment>
