<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in questioning sound assumptions ("What if not just heard?") drives the pivotal micro-choice; embodied emotion via "tremor of anticipation" and palm-on-bell moment avoids epiphany clichés. Flaw: Limited flaw exploration beyond patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: Elian's entire sonic paradigm shatters as light becomes connection ("no longer golden shadows of loss"). Accumulative lens holds—sensory shift from sound to light reweights stakes through the lens bloom. Cost proof: "texture of connection was a real, physical thing" crystallizes the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (miner's lens) constrains the climax choice and charges the final image—the scratched glass transforms sound into visible connection lattice. Ozone/dust atmosphere isn't ornamental; it necessitates the visual solution in a sound-obsessed world. "Golden shadows" motif evolves from loss to rediscovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: questioning assumptions ("What if sound wasn't just heard?") directly enables the lens solution. Dominant stake (connection texture) tightens when the bell's silence forces a paradigm shift. Cost is felt in the final image's shift from "shadows of loss" to "light of rediscovered truth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hologram's "interwoven hands" image—not stated morality. Final light resonance answers the central question: connection is tangible pattern, not abstract sound. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in the bell's physical glow, though "rediscovered truth" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elian's "pilgrimage" lens filters details ("tomb" reverence, "surgeon" precision). Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("pattern bloomed—a shimmering, intricate lattice"). No POV drift; compression of lab history stays anchored to the silent bell's console.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; "shimmering, intricate lattice" shows textural specificity. Minor deduction: "powerfully gentle strength" (Q1) slightly echoes in "powerfully gentle touch" (climax), risking synonym churn. Final line’s "quiet harmony" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lost sound" trope through the light-as-connection synthesis. Risk-taking (rejecting sonic solution for visual resonance) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in Elian’s tactile discovery ("laid a hand on the silent bell") avoids generic templates. Near-miss on 9.0 for slightly safe "rediscovered truth" phrasing.</comment>
