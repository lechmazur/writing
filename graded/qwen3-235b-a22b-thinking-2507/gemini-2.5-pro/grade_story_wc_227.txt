<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "alchemist only by grace of doubt" and trembling hands vs. coral anchor; micro-choices (touching first chip, hovering over heart crater) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost ("resolve crumbled, intention turning to ash").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: golden light eruption reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("made beautiful by it, scars a testament"); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in scar-filling sequence. Orientation anchors in first 28 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (coral charm) constrains choice at heart-crater climax and charges final image; acid sea pressure ("breath feeling thin") and bathysphere glass actively narrow perception during crisis, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: uncertainty ("poison, whispering misremembering") deepens until heart-crater moment; cost legible in "chest tightened" and "breath feeling thin" as leviathan shadow looms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral charm's evolving meaning—final image ("scars a testament to survival") reweights annihilation without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by embodying "kintsugi intentions" in binder application, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("screaming green tumult," "caustic fumes"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure (shorter sentences at heart-crater); no head-hopping, though "alchemist only by grace of doubt" borders on over-articulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "quilt memories together" avoids stock metaphor; final line ("exhaled a story") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle. Minor register drift in "dire enchantment of last chances" redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms kintsugi into narrative mechanism—emotional truth in "narrated quiet dignity of annihilation" avoids cliché; coral charm’s specificity ("piece of my first home") synthesizes loss and meaning through lived detail.</comment>
