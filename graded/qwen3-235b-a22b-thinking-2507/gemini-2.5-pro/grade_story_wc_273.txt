<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Albino traits embody trauma (light as "remembered pain"), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during ritual; "serene anger" remains monolithic despite high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: disappearance forecloses community ties with felt cost ("ignoring shouts of kin"), while "holy rage as compass" crystallizes stance under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved basin constrains choice (canvas for ink), but "consciously wild" concept remains abstract; sandstone's texture charges final image yet lacks tactical pressure during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: ink ritual narrows options to disappearance, with cost (severance from kin) visibly altering tactics; escalation driven by "quantum thread" pursuit under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through disappearing ink as non-literal answer to time mystery, but "consciously wild" lacks integration; final image reweights pursuit without moralizing, though conceptual cost needs sharper social dimension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("red eyes narrowing to slits," "syrupy stretching of time") modulates under stress; rhythm accelerates during ink ritual, with elision ("between, a place of silent, rushing movement") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "serene anger" repetition edges toward scaffold; figurative language ("blade's sharp edge," "viscous midnight") maintains clarity in peak beats, though "syrupy stretching" risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tracker tropes with quantum pursuit; albino traits transformed through environmental pressure (light as pain), though "consciously wild" concept lacks sufficient grounding in specific stakes.</comment>
