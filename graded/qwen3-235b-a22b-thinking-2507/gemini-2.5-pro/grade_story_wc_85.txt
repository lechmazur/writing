<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s guilt over false memories versus his resolve to restore truth; embodied emotion (“acidic burn of tempered regret”) avoids cliché. Final choice earned by driftwood discovery, but micro-choices under pressure lack sufficient irrationality to breach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: “Anya’s name would not be lost to the tide” crystallizes stakes with felt cost (“tempered regret now shared space with cold purpose”). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (hush, driftwood) reweights erasure as weapon without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood constrain choice (sifting method) and charge final image (clutching artifacts). Sensory specificity (“sandpaper on bone”) filters through Elias’s guilt, but weather’s role in action feels underutilized despite strong micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) tightens via driftwood discovery, narrowing options to memory restoration. Cost legible in Elias’s transformed guilt, but the “withheld truth” escalation lacks one visceral price paid mid-scene to fully satisfy 9.0’s cost proof test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through “sieved hush” evolving from mystery to weapon; final image reweights erasure without moralizing. Near-miss for 9.0—resonance is earned but lacks the lingering ambiguity required to transcend the central conflict’s resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“world bleeding from blue to bruised purple”) modulates with Elias’s guilt. Rhythmic control under pressure (“waves whispered against the shingle”) teaches and pays off elision; no head-hopping despite dense interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“sieved hush” evolves meaning across beats). Minor register drift (“psychic signature”) in high-pressure moment prevents 9.0, but final line (“would not be lost to the tide”) recharges motifs with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory erasure as political tool transforms noir tropes. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes, but lacks the “bold structural choice” (+0.2) to breach 9.0—closure remains conventionally resolved despite thematic depth.</comment>
