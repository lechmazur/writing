<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotions shine: Mara’s rigid anger draining into "weary understanding" shows contradiction without labels. Jorn’s silent tension ("shock and relief warring in his eyes") avoids over-explanation. Micro-choice of Kael stepping between them reveals hierarchy of values. Slight thinness in Jorn’s interiority holds score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Mara’s slumped shoulders and shuddering sigh reconfigure the "weighted breath" into weary unity. Causal lens holds perfectly—Kael’s investigation directly triggers the reconfiguration. Cost proof is explicit in "the rigid anger draining away," meeting the gate test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The milky quartz fragment constrains choice and charges closure as an "imperfect key," evolving from plot device to thematic anchor. Lighthouse orchard’s "shifting ice floes" pressure Mara’s fear of history repeating. Final image ("mending more than just a rope") reweights the setting’s fragility without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community fracture) tightens through Kael’s agency: his investigation forecloses accusation by revealing the accident’s truth. Cost is Mara’s emotional exhaustion, visible in her physical collapse. Pressure grows coherently under Causal lens—no coincidence resolves the conflict, only earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: Kael "mapping empathy onto action" crystallizes in his non-judgmental revelation. Final sigh reweights the opening "weighted breath" as shared vulnerability, avoiding moralizing. "Terrified of losing more people" ties fear to concrete memory without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael’s "calmly intuitive" noticing ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "imperfect key") shapes syntax. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, clipped sentences during climax ("He wasn’t severing it; he was trying to save it"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance stays anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "weighted breath" motif reappears with new meaning without redundancy. High density ("a thing of sharp edges and bitter weight" conveys emotion physically). Final line charges closure with precision: "first step toward mending more than just a rope" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" transforms the mediator trope through specific method (glimpses in mirrors). Risk-taking heightens stakes—resolution via reflection, not confrontation—without gimmickry. "Lighthouse orchard" specificity avoids generic Arctic clichés.</comment>
