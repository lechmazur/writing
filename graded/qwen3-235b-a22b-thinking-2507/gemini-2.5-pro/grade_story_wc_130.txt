<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "peace that was not happiness," avoiding emotional arithmetic; embodied grief via mosaic tracing and hollow ache. Epiphany risks abstraction but saved by concrete "seedling" action; no diagnostic labels under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: void remains but "no longer formless specter," reconfigured via light lattice. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at projection—while "three cycles" backstory anchors under BRR without summarizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone constrains choice (depressions for eyes) and charges final image (fingertips on chips → seedling breaking ground). Stalactites aren’t backdrop but literal nourishment; sensory selection narrows under ritual pressure to tactile limestone and light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying ambiguous loss) tightens when lattice emerges, narrowing options from seeking to acceptance. Agency-driven escalation—Elian’s channeling transforms jagged pain into smoothed geometry—with cost legible in "void now has a name" foreclosing desperate search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light lattice’s "jagged edges smoothed by cherished moments," avoiding moralizing. Final seedling image reweights loss as fertile ground without stating wisdom; complexity lingers in "dovetailed structure" embracing absence/presence duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "web of fissures" and "hollow ache"; rhythm modulates from measured tracing to urgent "holding breath." No head-hopping; lyrical compression ("unsolved equation that unbalanced the world") taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dovetail sharp reality with gentle memory" layers meaning efficiently. Minor drift in "patient, dripping stalactites" (slight cliché) but redeemed by "buried optimism breaking like a seedling"—textural specificity drives closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via mathematical magic: "geometric structure of sorrow" made visceral through mosaic data points. Emotional truth anchors novelty—Lyra’s fingerprints "metaphorically embedded" avoids quirkiness, commitment to premise reconfigures loss as charged geometry.</comment>
