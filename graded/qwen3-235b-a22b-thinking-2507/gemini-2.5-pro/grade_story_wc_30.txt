<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during the ritual; "accepting contradictions" is stated but not dramatized through micro-choices. Embodiment is strong (brass joints, optical sensors) but final action feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative/Textural closure: the silver fish in the creel crystallize Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (endless cycle). Tidal progression creates perfect pressure density without causality breaks; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains every choice—rising water forces identity migration, moon-charged brine enables smelting. The creel’s fragility against titan-gear directly charges the final image of preserved wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes lack visceral escalation; preservation ritual proceeds without meaningful friction. Conceptual cost (endless repetition) is legible but not viscerally felt during the action, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image of fish swimming in the creel offers resonant non-literal answer to "preserving wonder" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through ritual mechanics—no abstraction, only charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: optical sensors cataloging salt patterns, brass joints chiming. Rhythm modulates with tides (serene precision → lyrical hum), and patterned elision (identity migration) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("sliver of polished bone") and thematic statement ("accepting contradictions") slightly dulls peak-beat clarity. Otherwise, zero loops, high density, and propulsion perfectly synced to tidal movement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms titan-gear tropes through specific mechanics: smelting memory-ore with empathetic heat, identity migration tied to tidal physics. Emotional truth in preserving fragmented identities avoids surface novelty.</comment>
