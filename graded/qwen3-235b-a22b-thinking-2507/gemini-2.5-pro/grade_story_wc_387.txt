<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (observer/participant) drives the whistle action; embodied emotion in "warmth still blooming in his palm" and "demure audacity" avoids labels; final renunciation of separation earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "he had not been separate from it," reconfiguring his purpose; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern density tightening toward crystallized final image of mending tools as "instruments for participating."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tea bowl's physical warmth and cooling state constrain choices (abandoned for fireflies, reclaimed at return) and charge the final image; "whispering parapet" micro-setting shapes descent/ascent tactics while mirroring the net motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: firefly observation deepens to active participation (whistle), narrowing options to acceptance; cost legible in "no disappointment" after failed harmony, reweighting stakes through quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (tea whisk tines → firefly net → mending tools); final line reweights "appreciation" as participation without moralizing, answering the central question through charged object reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "scintillatingly somber" lexicon and net-mender metaphors; rhythmic control shifts from flowing observation to staccato action ("He stopped.") under pressure, with elision (firefly response) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lime-green light" exemplifies textural specificity over generic description; final line’s "scintillatingly somber dark" recharges opening motif with conceptual cost, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "philosopher laborer" trope through net/firefly/tea motif synthesis; emotional specificity in "demure audacity" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
