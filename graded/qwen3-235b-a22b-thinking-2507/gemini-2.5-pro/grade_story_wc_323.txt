<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "marvel tinged with profound sorrow" and anchor-to-chain metaphor. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak, though micro-choices during research lack visible tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "felt the pull of a current... toward endless sky" reconfigures horizons. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through edge-geometry density; orientation clear by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic city’s micro-setting (pressure checks, sonar sweeps) actively constrains choices. Anchor link evolves from relic to "first link," charging the final image with tangible weight and crushing-dark specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kaelen’s secret research, narrowing options to council confrontation. Conceptual cost ("profound sorrow for how small his world had been") reweights the star chart with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through edge geometry’s evolution, not moralizing. Final star chart offers non-literal answer: horizons as navigable currents, avoiding binaries while embracing the sorrow of expanded awareness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: nautical physics ("safe harbors," "currents") infuses cosmic scale. Rhythm shifts from clinical ("pressure checks") to lyrical ("celestial fire") without losing voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "perpetual, pressurized twilight" compresses setting into action. Final line recharges anchor motif with "new ocean to cross"—dense, uncluttered propulsion that crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deep-sea canyon navigation repurposed for cosmic edges. Avoids derivative tropes through concrete algorithmic detail; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry ("edge geometry" as lived method).</comment>
