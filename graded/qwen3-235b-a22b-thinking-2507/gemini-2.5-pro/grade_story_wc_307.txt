<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (desperate wanting vs. need to vanish), but Elara's "drowning in your own wake" line risks thematic echo; saved by being character-voiced and charging closure with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of a library"), but Elara's backward-aging backstory enters mid-scene as exposition, triggering Non-closure Accumulation Cap (-0.8) despite perfect RR escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pond functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final mirror image, but "sycamore hush" creates anachronistic dissonance (no sycamores on floating rocks) without payoff, slightly dulling environmental coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's attention shift under Elara's pressure, with conceptual cost legible in the RR; minor deduction as escalation leans heavily on Elara's monologue rather than Kael's active choices until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (ripple reversal) with no moralizing; final "dark mirror" reweights the opening cosmos reflection as a resonant non-literal answer to "vanishing to appear," avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is stellar (frustration coloring descriptions like "shrill note"), but "life spooling backwards" uses unmotivated academic diction ("spooling") that clashes with Kael's POV during high-pressure reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm and density, but adjacent sentences ("concentric rings that spread... rings widened") create a paraphrase loop without added pressure, triggering -0.2 Text-Artifact penalty in a non-closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "wise teacher" trope through ripple mechanics and backward-aging stakes; fresh synthesis feels inevitable, though the floating platform's specificity lacks deeper world logic integration beyond atmosphere.</comment>
