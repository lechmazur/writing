<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation (“plant forests of second thoughts”) manifests through concrete micro-choices like cradling the stone to weave hope, avoiding therapy-speak. Maya’s shift from *What if they’re right?* to *I can draw that* shows earned internal contradiction, though her minimal on-page presence slightly limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Maya’s thought crystallizes the town’s shift from resignation to curiosity, with the stone’s warmth embodying undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, though “forest was seeded” edges toward over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt library’s “frozen sea” depth and grotto’s lodestone actively constrain Elias’s tactics—he must retrieve the stone there to amplify the town’s chord. The stone’s final warmth charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully at the ninth bell, narrowing options to a single decisive deepening: the window displays force a collective stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the stone’s warmth and Maya’s irreversible shift, though the Authority’s threat remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the baker’s loaf and mechanic’s gear—no moralizing, just resonant particulars reweighting the prophecy as a “conversation.” The final image (“future was no longer a declaration”) answers the central question without stating morals, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“static-filled broadcast only he could receive”) reflects Elias’s anxiety under pressure. Rhythmic control intensifies with the ninth bell’s chime, though “thought flicker” slightly dilutes specificity in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where “velvet cloth” and “cloudy sky” do triple duty for setting/theme/motivation. Minor overwriting in “amplified quiet” (repeated twice near climax) prevents 9.5+, but closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through hyper-specific objects (baker’s braided loaf, gear for “no known engine”). The grotto’s lodestone reweights prophecy as a “chord,” feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
