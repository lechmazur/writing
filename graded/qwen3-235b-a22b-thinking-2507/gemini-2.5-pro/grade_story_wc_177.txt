<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s fractured perception drives visceral micro-choices (trembling hands, tongue dissolution), with embodied contradiction (fear/curiosity) culminating in earned renunciation. Epiphany avoids abstraction via sensory cost ("grit of concrete dust"), though ancestral backstory leans slightly summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Kael’s dissolution of the seal crystallizes "the path grew the walker" with felt cost (drowning water vs. transcendent rain). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift, though storm’s physical threat slightly overshadows internal resolution in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wafer seal (tool) charges the climax—"texture like a moth’s wing"—while rain reconfigures from threat to presence. Bunker’s decay constrains choices (glass housing break), but "vine-draped" setting details verge on ornamental until the reclamation moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve cylinder/understand path) tightens via storm’s pressure, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is legible in "water swirled around his ankles" as Kael embraces dissolution, though physical peril and conceptual shift could interweave more tightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "the path grew the walker" reweights the central question through Kael’s embodied transcendence, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("feeling the rain... for the very first time") resonates as non-literal answer with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gray smear of the present," "ozone and forgotten starlight") modulates under pressure. Fugue-state dreams teach the pattern early, but "decaying directive" repetition slightly dulls voice coherence in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats; "dissolved instantly, a taste of ozone" shows rhythmic control. Minor paraphrase loop ("remembered with perfect clarity... saw with chilling certainty") prevents 9.0, though propulsion remains taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-perception tropes: "fractured sight" as necessary hunger reframes the guardian archetype. Risk-taking (consuming the key) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through "starve until desperate" groundwork.</comment>
