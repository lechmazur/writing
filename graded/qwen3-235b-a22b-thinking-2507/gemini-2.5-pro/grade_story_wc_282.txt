<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; fossil anchor works yet no blind spots drive inevitable mistakes. Final choice earned but internal conflict remains summarized ("let analytical mind fall away") not dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("legs felt heavy, rooted") but lens ambiguity at midpoint (-0.3). Orientation solid within 120 words; tidal retreat elegantly reconfigures stakes without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cave network actively constrains choices (squeezing passage, submerged archway) and charges final image. Micro-setting of fossil/floating heightens specificity; mineral tang and tide pressure choices without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensor's chaotic input but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shifts. Violet awe river guides passive following; cost ("heavy, rooted" legs) legible yet not tied to prior tactical alterations under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final waveform image reweights "voice of the unknown" without moralizing. Fossil-to-waveform arc embodies theme through concrete charge ("thin bridge between human past and planetary present"), avoiding pseudo-profundity in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint blues of lingering sorrow") modulates with pressure. Register drift in "resonant frequency matching thrum" slightly breaks POV plausibility, but lyrical compression at climax taught through sensor's earlier chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mineral tang of deep earth" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor artifact: "soft sounds on sand-dusted floor" (redundant) but no closure-dulling muddle. Final line’s "first translated syllable" achieves conceptual density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological consciousness via emotion heat-mapping. Avoids derivative tropes through specific stakes (sensor’s categorization limits) yet "tectonic joy" edges toward familiar awe without sufficient transformation.</comment>
