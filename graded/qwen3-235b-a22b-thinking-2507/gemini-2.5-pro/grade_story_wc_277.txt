<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's interior contradiction—calm precision masking filial devotion—drives her micro-choices (e.g., "solemn playfulness" masking urgency). Embodied emotion shines via tactile pen-nib weight and father's rain-triggered flinches. Slight tidiness in emotional resolution caps score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Celeste's counterpoints ("proof by contradiction") narrow Davies' options stepwise to Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in "prison of public suspicion" line—conceptual sacrifice made undeniable through dialogue beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rosewood pen nib (micro-setting) constrains choices (evidence retrieval) and charges closure (cool against palm amid stars). Observatory's rotation hum mirrors "orbits of regret," but spatial choreography lacks tactical pressure beyond pen access.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy) tightens via Celeste's agency: each question forecloses Davies' excuses with escalating cost (yacht sale, brother's betrayal). Final image reweights options through conceptual price—father's freedom sacrificed for reputation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orbital metaphor reweighted at closure: "painful orbit complete" crystallizes sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext thrives in pen-nib's blood-veined texture and Davies' whispered "His brother..."—resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV voice distinct via Celeste's lexical precision ("proof by contradiction") and perceptual bias (noticing father's April aversion). Rhythmic control peaks in dialogue's staccato logic; "solemn playfulness" modulates pressure without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via varied syntax ("The phone clicked dead...") and dense imagery ("star-dusted velvet"). Final line ("painful orbit complete") recharges motifs without overwriting. Slight register drift in "gravitational pull of regret" caps perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: logical method (proof by contradiction) weaponized for emotional truth. Transforms "sacrificial patriarch" trope through pen-nib specificity and observatory-as-metaphor. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure hinges on conceptual cost.</comment>
