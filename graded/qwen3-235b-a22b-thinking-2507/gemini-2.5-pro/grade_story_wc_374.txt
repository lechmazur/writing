<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (skepticism vs sensory proof) drives the climax; micro-choices like tasting pressure shifts reveal her scientific rigor under embodied stress. Secondary carriers apply pressure through merged weather systems, crystallizing her stance without dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (taste, weather convergence) tightens the dominant stake, culminating in the aurora’s absorption of storms. Cost is legible in Elara’s paradigm shift—"skepticism profoundly illuminated"—as the compass ring spins uselessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender bluff constrains choice via crushed scent mingling with ozone, charging the final image where "mouth tasted only of lavender." Aurora’s descent directly alters atmospheric stakes, avoiding static description through causal integration with the convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through Elara’s escalating sensory evidence (coppery tang → merged storms), narrowing options to acceptance. The aurora’s intervention reweights the stake with conceptual cost: her hypothesis becomes a "map written in lightning," foreclosing the "fixing people" path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final line—"reading a map written in lightning and rain"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (taste, compass ring), avoiding abstraction; the cost of humility in scientific pursuit lingers through sensory reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elara’s scientific lexicon ("emergent compass," "control group") filters aurora descriptions. Rhythmic control peaks during convergence ("drizzle thickened, wind whipped fog"), but minor register drift in "terrestrially cosmic" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("coppery tang bloomed on her tongue" advances plot and character). "Ships pulled into a phantom harbor" risks mixed metaphor but is redeemed by contextual cohesion. Final line’s "lightning and rain" crystallizes momentum without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Taste-based weather detection transforms a trope through scientific framing; "futuristic nostalgia" for auroras grounds the speculative element. Risk-taking (sensory stakes over action) heightens coherence, though "forests hold elections" lacks full integration into Elara’s arc.</comment>
