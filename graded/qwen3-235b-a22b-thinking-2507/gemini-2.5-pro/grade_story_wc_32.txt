<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (cracking stoic mask at climax), but "penny drops" phrasing risks diagnostic label-speak. Micro-choices under pressure (discarding reagents) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (crozier's dissolution into light-flower), though "penny drops" cliché slightly undermines epiphany. Hybrid lens (causal buildup → textural payoff) holds through earned surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains choice (dying ley line heat) and charges final image (cool flower vs warm ashes). Tool-as-setting (crozier fragments) directly shapes tactics, with sensory specificity ("greasy soot," "wraith-blossom dew") avoiding symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through visceral failure repetitions (soot residue, flinching spirit), but "stifling destiny" remains abstract until climax. Agency shift (command → surrender) narrows options with felt cost in final dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (broken crozier → moonlight flower), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "creative destruction" as surrender without stating thesis, though "purest secret potential" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frantic sensitivity churning within," "ley lines fizzled") modulates under pressure. Voice maintains consistent alchemical lexicon, but "penny drops" cliché breaks focalization's plausibility in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("He did not chant; he listened"), but "penny drops" is a stock phrase violating voice in climax. Figurative language stays clean and purposeful outside this single artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creative destruction" as surrender (not command) transforms alchemy tropes. Bold risk in quiet climax heightens stakes, with moonlight flower's specificity avoiding generic "epiphany" clichés.</comment>
