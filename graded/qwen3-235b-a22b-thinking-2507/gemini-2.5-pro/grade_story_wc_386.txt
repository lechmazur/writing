<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Elara's flawless execution undercuts struggle. Motivation ("salvage something pure") is clear but untested—no micro-choice reveals competing values during climax. Final release lacks embodied cost beyond emotional relief, weakening Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: boy’s smile and intact snow globe reconfigure the melted relic’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (murderer’s dissolution). Accumulative lens holds—dream fragments accumulate into density shift that forces stance crystallization without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (triggering signal, enabling climax) and charging the final image as memorial. Glacier shrine’s atmosphere is vivid but ornamental; only the globe’s transformation from prison to memorial actively shapes the closure’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: gathering dream cameos (pressure) tightens into creating the shared dreamscape (deepening), narrowing options to exposure. Cost is visible in the murderer’s dissolution and the boy’s final smile—a felt trade-off that reweights "salvage" as release, not retrieval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe’s transformation: broken relic → memorial, rejecting "salvage" as retrieval for release. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—the boy’s intact globe in the climax offers a resonant answer to "something pure" via conceptual cost (truth exposed, soul freed).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("walls weep history," "dream-ocean") and rhythmic control under pressure. Sentence fragments ("He never speaks") sharpen the climax. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally to amplify the dreamscape’s density without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "candle flames... holding their breath" and final "borrowed starlight" line achieve high density without muddle. Prose propels rhythmically—no figurative overwriting even in high-pressure beats. Closure image ("memorial to a small, pure truth") crystallizes with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost whisperer" trope via glacial setting and snow globe mechanic. Emotional specificity in the boy’s silent cameos avoids cliché. Risk-taking (truth-weaving through dream fragments) heightens stakes coherently, though "wreck-diver" label edges toward template without deeper occupational integration.</comment>
