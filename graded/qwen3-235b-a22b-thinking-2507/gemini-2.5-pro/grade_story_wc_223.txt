<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feigned sorrows tasted like ash" versus raw grief; micro-choices like tracing letters reveal values. Near-therapy-speak in "unscripted agony" narrowly avoids penalty due to embodied tears through grime. Final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost in Regent's cracked composure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "Regent flinched, composure cracking like fine porcelain" reconfigures options as the lock groans. Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic escalation of walking patterns. Cost proof evident in the visceral image of broken control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dusty floor, chessboard) constrains choice: dust enables coded walking, missing pawns charge the climax when Regent stares at empty squares. "Groan that echoed" makes the setting's tactile reality inseparable from closure's cost. Meets 9+ gate decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: SECRET→RELEASE→UNBIND tightens pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in Regent's frozen posture and the "immense" lock groan. Dominant stake ("stability requires sacrifice") reweights through Elara's performance foreclosing the Regent's surgical calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pawnless chessboard evolves from memorial to catalyst. Final image ("allow the game to begin again") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Regent never articulates the thesis, preserving complexity of "benevolently ruthless" calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "memories... tasted like ash," "luminous absence." Rhythm modulates under pressure—fragmented during tapping, flowing in climax. Zero head-hopping; lexicon ("professional mourner") stays true to crisis actor POV even in raw grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "composure cracking like fine porcelain" avoids cliché with precise vehicle. High density: "tears traced paths through grime" embodies loss without abstraction. Final line recharges chess motif while avoiding overwriting—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chess as power" trope through missing pawns symbolizing absent masses. Walking-code method feels fresh, not gimmicky. Risk-taking in quiet climax where unscripted grief—not dialogue—triggers change. Emotional specificity ("tasted like ash") avoids generic templates.</comment>
