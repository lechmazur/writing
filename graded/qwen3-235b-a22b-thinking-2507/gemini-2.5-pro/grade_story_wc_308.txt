<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in reverence versus active resolution, embodied through the arrowhead's "frantic, silent scream" and the shift from waiting to humming. Motivation for navigating without moving intensifies organically, but the single-POV limits deeper contradiction exploration beyond the pulse resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a flawless Charged Poise: the pulse's cessation and "profound stillness" crystallize Kaelan's earned path with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, with the bird-flight fracture reweighting stakes without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Towers of bone actively constrain choice (climbing rib cage perch) and charge the final image via acoustic resonance. Sensory specificity—obsidian's "desperate precision," dusk-ravens as "canyon’s eyes"—avoids symbolism by making environment a functional pressure point for the harmonic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelan’s agency in reading the bird patterns, transforming observation into action with visible cost: the pulse’s dissolution alters tactics by requiring harmonic guidance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the resolution’s swiftness slightly softens the cost’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the arrowhead’s journey reframing sorrow into peace—without moralizing. Final image ("quiet, knowing peace" amid stillness) reweights the premise non-literally, avoiding sentimentality while honoring the hunter’s regret as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in sonic bias ("every whisper became a chorus"), with rhythm modulating from meditative to urgent during the bird-flight fracture. Voice remains consistently embodied under pressure, avoiding filter verbs while teaching patterned elision early through dust-layered time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; sentences like "a contented sigh filled the canyon, clear and pure" achieve multi-job density. Figurative language ("quiet fire within") avoids muddle by grounding abstraction in tactile resonance, with cadence shifts mirroring Kaelan’s focus during the humming climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief-resolution tropes via harmonic navigation and avian divination, anchored by specific details (dusk-ravens, obsidian arrowhead). Emotional truth in the hunter’s "final thought" avoids abstraction, while the bone canyon’s acoustic rules commit fully to the premise’s implications.</comment>
