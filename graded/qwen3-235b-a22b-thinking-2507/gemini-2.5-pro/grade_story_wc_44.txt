<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; "obsessive precision" versus fluid reality manifests as consistent method rather than clashing impulses. Embodied emotion remains cerebral (e.g., "profound satisfaction" lacks physiological texture). Micro-choice (pushing key inward) reveals value hierarchy but no visible tradeoff cost beyond intellectual effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "shadows turned inside out" reweights reality’s fabric, charged by "frayed tapestry" motif. Accumulative lens holds via density escalation—rune study tightening into topological alignment—culminating in the projection’s reconfiguration. Orientation clear by 80 words; cost legible in "profound satisfaction of one small piece... making perfect sense again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating observatory’s position directly constrains the shadow mystery, making setting indispensable to closure. The island’s spatial relationship to the sun charges the final image ("shadow folded inward on itself"), fulfilling micro-setting gate. Sensory details (brass automaton’s "tangible darkness," "shimmering folding space") filter through rune scholar’s professional bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: relearning "inversion" to "inside out" narrows options from weeks of study to the key’s paradoxical alignment. Dominant stake (shadow’s secret) tightens via conceptual deepening, but cost remains intellectual rather than visceral—no tangible forfeiture beyond emotional resolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens through density accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "shadows turned inside out" reframes reality’s "frayed tapestry" without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise—closure as earned restoration of "tiny knot of stability"—avoiding thematic echo. Complexity lingers in "next unravelled thread," resisting tidy resolution while charging the conceptual cost of perpetual uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: runic logic shapes diction ("topological knot," "logical loop"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—slow cadence during key alignment shifts to crisp closure. No head-hopping; voice remains anchored in scholarly precision even during revelation ("light that was not light at all").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("dormant automaton slumped... dust sheeted its intricate gears" compresses setting/character). Minor deduction for "dissolved like sugar in hot tea"—borderline cliché in high-pressure beat. Final line ("mind already moving toward the next unravelled thread") charges closure with rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: shadow topology reframes "spoon-bending" through scholarly lens, avoiding derivative tropes. Risk-taking elevates stakes—conceptual resolution replaces physical confrontation—while maintaining coherence. Emotional specificity in quiet satisfaction ("profound satisfaction of one small piece... making sense") avoids generic templates, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
