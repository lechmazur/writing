<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction—rational truffle forager using fringe science—drives authentic micro-choices under pressure. His embodied restraint at the climax ("words formed... but then, they stopped") earns the closure with visceral cost, avoiding therapy-speak entirely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably: the occlusion ritual's cost ("words formed... but then, they stopped") crystallizes his new stance with conceptual weight. Orientation anchors by line 25 ("hanging orchard grafted onto sheer cliffs"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the storm's pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ravine orchard actively constrains choices (battered but holding during storm), while the glass eye's physicality ("cerulean iris," "cool and heavy") charges the final image. Micro-setting elevates to 9+ band by reweighting "fractured grace" into resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (protecting Lena's memory) tightens through storm intensity and ritual focus. Elias's agency in occluding specific truth—not erasing it—creates irreversible trade-off with visible cost in the neighbor scene, meeting 9+ escalation test under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "psychological safety" as precious as truffles, silence as protection. Final image ("cerulean guardian") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "fractured grace" into earned peace—no thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind stealing words," "fractured grace") modulates rhythm under pressure. Voice remains Elias-specific even in stress ("rational, desperate hope"), with no register drift or filter-verb stacks, meeting 9+ rhythmic control test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sheets of rain hammered" shows rather than tells. Every line advances story (e.g., "unblinking object pressed against his skin" charges ritual tension). Final line's specificity ("cerulean guardian") recharges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms relic trope through meteorite-silicate specificity and grief's emotional truth. Risk-taking with quiet closure pays off: the eye's "placidity" reconfigures "psychological safety" as active choice, avoiding derivative premise guardrail.</comment>
