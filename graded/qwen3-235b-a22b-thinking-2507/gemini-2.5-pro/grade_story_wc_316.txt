<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's interior contradiction (numbness vs. desperate curiosity) drives authentic micro-choices during vivification, with embodied emotion ("phantom limb of an emotion"). Jin remains underdeveloped as mere opposition, lacking specific worldview that would deepen the relationship crucible beyond fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "profound and terrifying sense of responsibility" reconfigures Kael's stance while history rewrites outside. Causal lens holds perfectly—"because Kael channeled opposites, the brain sparked, cracking his numbness"—with persistent temporal pressure shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brain jar functions as essential micro-setting, constraining Kael's choice to vivify it and charging the final image with neural light patterns. Floating dojo's temporal clouds pressure stakes but lack tangible resource constraints, narrowly missing the 9.0 gate despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens meaningfully when Kael ignores Jin's ultimatum to act, narrowing options to creation or stagnation. Cost is visceral in the "draining sensation" and culminates in responsibility—a felt price that reconfigures his existence under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Kael's method: "creation through complementary opposites" becomes the non-literal answer to "can emptiness be defeated?" Final image of responsibility's "crack" reweights prior numbness without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete neural imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced in slanted light" mirroring fragmented mind) and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats. Slight register drift in "ego death" risks abstraction but is redeemed by embodied execution; no dialogue contamination since Jin's voice remains character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story with textural specificity ("bruised purple to violent orange"). Peak-beat propulsion ("Hot and cold, presence and absence") avoids figurative muddle while compressing emotional complexity, with final line's "crack" charging closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "clone" tropes through specific emotional calculus: Kael seeks not resurrection but new creation from wreckage. Risk-taking with philosophical premise ("complementary opposites") heightens stakes coherently, avoiding middle-ground hedging via the earned, non-joyous crack in numbness.</comment>
