<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in sculptor’s tactile cognition; "hands and mind working in perfect sync" shows embodied contradiction under pressure. No diagnostic labels despite high stakes. Final renunciation of "just shaping wood" earned by prior causality with visible cost in soaked shivering body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: receding water reveals "driftwood scattered... letters in a language" with conceptual cost of shattered worldview. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm density and slide revelations accumulate pressure toward architectural solution. Cost proof in "dripping and shivering" + "world... disconnected from alliances."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archway functions as micro-setting constraining choices: sea-spray enables projection surface, rock shape channels wave. "Velvet-lined box impossibly dry" in storm demonstrates tactile specificity. Final image of driftwood as "letters" charges closure through recurring object with environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: slide’s final layer reveals solution diagram, narrowing options to immediate construction. Dominant stake (survival) tightens through rising wave, with visible cost (soaked to thigh) and conceptual cost (worldview destruction). Coincidence (finding slide) complicates but agency resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "driftwood as letters" reconfiguration—no stated moral. Central question ("what sustains this shore?") answered by final action of rebuilding alliances, not preservation. Avoids thematic echo; "world not broken, merely disconnected" shows earned wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: sculptor’s eye notices "calloused thumb over gnarled burl," "water-logged timbers." Rhythmic control peaks in "water surged... but the killing force was broken." Minor register drift in "perpetually learning" during crisis, but compression serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "great, shushing roar that divided" shows syntactic variety. Slight density issue in "turbine-hum reverie" (mechanical/dream clash), but payoff in final "turbine-hum... easing into a sigh" justifies risk. Final line’s concrete reprise ("remembering and rebuilding") avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms survival trope through sculptor’s lens: driftwood barrier as "most honest sculpture." Specificity of "seal-like creatures" and "hand-cranked lantern" avoids generic post-apocalypse. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure image recharges "scaffold complexity" motif.</comment>
