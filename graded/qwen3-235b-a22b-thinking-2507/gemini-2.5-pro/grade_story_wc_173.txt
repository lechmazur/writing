<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; no visible struggle during high-stakes dance despite decade-long burden. "Bodily poetic" remains abstract label without tradeoffs (e.g., physical strain of maintaining control while untangling grief). Micro-choices lack hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the silent light wave releases echoes with undeniable conceptual cost (city's masters facing buried truths). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each untangled knot intensifies density until the sigh/light release reconfigures meaning. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snow and prism constrain choices: snow’s silence enables echo-harvesting; prism’s fragility charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy sharp (frost clinging, frigid air) but courtyard’s spatial choreography lacks tactical pressure (e.g., no proximity to walls during dance).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: each knot untangled narrows Elara’s options until the judge’s regret demands the final release. Cost is visceral—the sigh releasing "immense burden"—and the light wave’s return of truths forecloses the city’s path of denial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "harvest of echoes" becomes the non-literal answer to conformity’s lullaby. Final image of "alarming serenity" reweights the opening snowfall without moralizing. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from the prism’s silent light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (echoes as "frost," movements as "stanza"), but minor register drift: "psychic weight" slightly clinical for Elara’s lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless—the dance sequence’s cadence mirrors unraveling knots.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("sorrowful vibrations of a life lived within rigid lines"). Minor overwriting: "bodily poetic" and "stanza of perfect control" adjacent in para 1 risk cliché. Final line’s "seeded a rebellion" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete "hearts of her keepers."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chaste courtesan as psychic spy transforms tropes. Prism’s release—not destruction—of power reweights revolution. Risk-taking (accumulative pressure over action) heightens stakes; emotional specificity in "general’s grief for a son he could never publicly mourn" avoids abstraction.</comment>
