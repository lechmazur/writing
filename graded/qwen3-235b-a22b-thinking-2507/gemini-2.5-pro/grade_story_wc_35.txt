<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied contradiction ("grinding stones against skin" vs. "quiet warmth") with micro-choices like heated-pin shell opening revealing his ritualistic approach to sorrow. Final renunciation of "brittle parts" earns closure through cumulative pressure, though Warlord's secondary pressure lacks sufficient development for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("brittle parts gone") under Accumulative/Textural lens, where density of sorrow-motes reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors within 30 words; the pavilion's dissolution crystallizes the cost without soft resets. Minor deduction for abrupt courtyard-to-digging transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Desert setting actively constrains choices (bare-handed digging in "freshly scoured" dunes) and charges the final image through "weeping" dunes mirroring internal states. Coral pavilion's "impossible frost" functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, with sensory details like "bruised creosote" filtered through chef's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency as memory-density intensifies from single shell to "blizzard of grief," narrowing options to subsumption. Cost legible in "agony that scoured him clean," though the Warlord's specific grief lacks direct payoff in the climax beat, slightly diluting the dominant stake's charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sandpaper rough memories" transforms from abstract desire to visceral action during subsumption, with final image ("quiet warmth of living flesh") offering resonant answer to sorrow's weight without moralizing. Avoids all thematic pitfalls through embodied metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in chef's sensory lexicon ("ancient brine," "cold air") and rhythmic control during high-pressure subsumption ("pulverize his bones"). Minor deduction for slight register drift in "universe of stored remorse" during peak stress, though elision of tidal pool mechanics remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with lines like "shell ridged like a petrified thumbprint" doing triple duty. One paraphrase loop detected ("motes of pale luminescence, each one a captured moment of regret, a universe of stored remorse") triggering -0.3 per Text Artifact Screen, preventing 9.0 despite exceptional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-tasting chef and coral pavilion avoids tropes through specific emotional calculus ("sorrows: a mother’s lullaby..."). Transformation test passed—plot fails if chef becomes generic archaeologist—as the "sandpaper" motif grounds universality in lived detail without hedging.</comment>
