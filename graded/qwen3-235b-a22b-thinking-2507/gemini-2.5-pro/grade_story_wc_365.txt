<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs fearing horror) act simultaneously in the climax; final choice to redirect (not save) Elara earns endurance with visible cost in "understood the weight of the silence." No diagnostic label-speak during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "clean, neutral air" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("debt paid to a ghost who was never there"). Causal lens holds perfectly—"because" he redirects, echoes vanish. Cost legible in "weight of the silence" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Repair bay’s rust/fractured gantry actively constrains choices (sensory mapping); green shard charges final image when lowered "purpose fulfilled." Micro-setting drives tactics—concrete chill seeps through trousers during pivotal act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about Elara’s death) tightens via Kael’s agency: identifying resonance cascade forces trade-off (redirect or let echoes persist). Cost is visceral in "air tasted clean" after redirection, reweighting final image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "debt paid to a ghost who was never there" reweights truth-seeking without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; final image offers resonant answer to "withheld truth" via sensory map’s completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensory map maker" framing) with rhythmic control: "hum screamed, then snapped" mirrors pressure escalation. Zero head-hopping; elision of parallel worlds taught early via "sifting through layers" and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density in peak beats ("Focusing all his will through the shard..."). "Air tasted clean" delivers propulsion without figurative muddle. Slight register drift in "resonance cascade" (tech jargon) costs 0.1 but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "parallel worlds" trope through sensory mapping lens; emotional specificity ("parents simplified a horror they couldn’t explain") avoids generic templates. Fresh inflection: redirecting consequence (not saving Elara) grows organically from premise.</comment>
