<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically (raw knuckles vs pocketing leaf as "datapoint"), avoiding therapy-speak; micro-choices like abandoning repair for leaf inspection reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("goal wasn't to survive unchanged... grow toward light") lands with conceptual cost (retirement = amputation); Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation to quiet dawn realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis actively constrains choice (forces saw over hammer), while linden leaf charges final image; rain-slicked wood and raw knuckles embody stakes through micro-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: failed repair attempt narrows options, leaf discovery deepens knowledge; cost legible in "amputation" metaphor and physical tension release during saw retrieval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vine's behavior ("yielded, sacrificing rigid structure"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "reluctant metamorphosis" as non-literal answer to central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via botanical precision ("flawlessly heart-shaped leaf," "pale green tendrils questing"); rhythmic control under stress shown in fragmented syntax during trellis collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "breath fogging a small circle of glass" exemplifies triple-duty prose; final line’s "quiet potential of the ruin" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "midlife crisis" trope through nursery owner’s embodied expertise; emotional specificity in "grinding change" and "sustaining transformation" avoids generic templates with verifiable detail.</comment>
