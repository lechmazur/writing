<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (singular/collective) drive the pivotal realization; enduring decaying vessel with awareness provides visible cost. Slight underdevelopment of flaws limits 9.0 eligibility despite strong micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conceptual Repricing closure lands with undeniable cost ("decaying vessel"), but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics—the rope remains symbolic rather than altering choice mechanics under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto establishes vivid atmosphere, but the frayed rope alone charges the final image ("difficult freedom"), meeting 9+ gate. Setting functions lyrically without constraining active choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elias’s agency in uncovering pattern layers, yet the cost ("decaying vessel") remains abstractly stated rather than viscerally felt in the final beat, diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete rope/pattern motifs: "smudges on the paper" avoids moralizing while reweighting existence’s value. Final declaration ("stand in the doorway") delivers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poet’s perceptual signature ("cosmic choreography," "heat haze") creates distinct voice with rhythmic control, though minimal dialogue pressure limits deeper voice modulation tests under crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical density maintained without muddle; "earthen womb" metaphor slightly tensions physical logic but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis reframes ascension tropes through "texture of time" specificity. Risk-taking conceptual closure avoids gimmickry, though Lumin beings edge toward familiar archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
