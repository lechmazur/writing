<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (nurturing hands vs father's calloused grip) act simultaneously during knife handling; final renunciation earned through embodied micro-choices like direct kneeling on tiles. Only minor tell in "gift, if it could be called that" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively in "act of profound negation" with conceptual cost of heritage denial. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: phantom blood scent tightens stakes, sheathing reconfigures options. Orientation clear by line 3 with silica dunes/glass dome anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (leather-wrapped knife hilt, sandbag scrap) constrains choices—sheathing instead of discarding—and charges final image where rose color mirrors opening sunset. Body (knee contact with tiles) embodies her commitment shift with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single deepening via protagonist agency: knife's "unnaturally heavy" weight escalates to sheathing as renunciation that forecloses violence. Cost is palpable in "deny its power," reweighting the dominant stake (continuity vs chaos) through the dome's quiet reassertion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final rose "brimming with quiet strength" offers non-literal answer to "weave continuity through chaos" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from particulars—no thematic echo—while "coffin for a future" crystallizes conceptual cost through charged image rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: botanical focus shapes sensory hierarchy (ignoring sound for root-tremors), compression under stress ("vast and hungry" for desert). Zero head-hopping; rhythm modulates from lyrical opening to staccato tension during blood-memory sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "slick, final sound" multiplies meaning as closure propulsion. "Sun bled" establishes tone without muddle, final line recharges opening sunset with earned resonance. Minor deduction for "senselessly perceptive" abstraction, redeemed by concrete root-tremor detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter's pacifist child" trope through desert rose farm specificity and plant-values inculcation. Risk-taking succeeds: quiet climax avoids violence while "coffin for a future" delivers bold conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
