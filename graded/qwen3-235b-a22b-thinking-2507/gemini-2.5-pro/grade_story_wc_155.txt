<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "coax it out gently" vs "frustration pricked," with embodied cost in the pensive smile replacing boisterous glee. Final choice earned through micro-choice of using the fragment, though reflection on past joy lacks specific tactile triggers beyond the mural.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "fleeting act of remembrance" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (impermanence of joy). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density increase during painting; fog's encroachment reweights stakes without causal breaks. Knowledge network ellipsis slightly muddies escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog actively pressures choices by "reclaiming" colors, while the fresco fragment functions as micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory selection ("damp scent of moss," "pearlescent light") filters through Elian's artistic bias, avoiding white-room syndrome. Postcard description of espaliers slightly dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as light-density intensifies under fog pressure. The fragment's use narrows options from "frustration" to "coaxing," with visible cost in traded permanence for "pensive mirth." Knowledge network's minimal role slightly weakens escalation's protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the light-mural's fragility: "joy rediscovered not in permanence" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image's "bittersweet warmth" avoids sentimentality while charging the fresco fragment's recurrence. No thematic echo—purely earned through the painting's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fog had claimed this place, muting the ghosts of apple blossoms" reflects Elian's artistic POV. Rhythmic control heightens pressure via sentence variation ("He closed his eyes, not against the fog..."). Stress compression in "colors bleeding" maintains voice consistency without artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light-saturated negative" achieves high density without muddle. Final line ("echo of its light... warmed his chest") recharges motifs with propulsion. Slight overwriting in "skeletal remains of ancient espaliers" risks coherence but pays off through consistent metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting with memory work avoids trope clichés. Emotional specificity in "pensive mirth" transforms the joy motif, while conceptual integrity in impermanence feels inevitable. Knowledge network's underdevelopment slightly dilutes the risk-taking's payoff.</comment>
