<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("foxglove regret," "bitter taste") and flaw-driven, but final choice lacks contradictory impulses during the lighting act; motivation is clear yet the climax misses simultaneous conflicting drives required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise (orchid lights then fades, "bitter taste" of preservation-as-loss), with conceptual cost legible in "another piece of the world below lost forever." Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but one tightening lacks the microscopic escalation depth for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube constrains the ritual (fracture creates "fragile sorrow" note) and charges the final image ("hand held out in darkness" light). Micro-setting integration is exemplary, though "opal library" description leans slightly postcard-like without spatial pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust before extinction) tightens through Elian's pitch-chasing, with visible cost in "foxglove regret." Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens, but the single deepening lacks the microscopic trade-off nuance expected at 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the orchid's "hand held out" glow and fading voices reweight preservation as irrevocable loss. Zero moralizing; final image ("bitter taste") delivers resonant non-literal answer to "can echoes replace life?" without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("opal floors swirled with captive light," "toxic sadness") with rhythmic control, but "resonate with its core identity" drifts into academic register. Elision (fragmented memories) is taught early and pays off in the chorus of voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "foxglove regret" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-deduction for "ritual of dusting and polishing that held the crushing emptiness at bay" / "gently systematic" proximity, but high density and closure propulsion prevent penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "museum of emotions" trope through glass orchids and bamboo fracture. "Foxglove regret" synthesizes freshness with emotional truth, but safety-middle hedging slightly in avoiding deeper exploration of Elian's personal loss.</comment>
