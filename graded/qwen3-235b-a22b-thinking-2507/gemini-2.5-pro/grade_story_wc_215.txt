<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "chaining her here" retroactively alters causality; embodied emotions strong ("fingers clumsy from disuse") yet flaw consistency breaks in pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks at honeycomb reveal with undeniable cost ("decades of solitude falling away"); Earned Stasis closure crystallizes shared burden without physical act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scorched apiary constrains choices (kneeling in dust) and charges final image; "phantom honey" sensory detail mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency (opening box) with felt cost in "weight... now shared"; ghost dissolution shows consequence but secondary stake ("tangled covenant") lacks escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through honeycomb's light reweighting silence; avoids moralizing with Lyra's nod as resonant answer to "unspoken words" burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("shimmering in heat haze"), but "profound miscalculation" risks therapy-speak; rhythmic control under pressure flawless in closure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dissolving like sugar in water" shows textural specificity. Minor deduction for "profound, mute eloquence" bordering label-speak in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief/silence through beekeeping lens; risk-taking in ghost mechanics heightens stakes but "chaining" trope slightly derivative without full transformation.</comment>
