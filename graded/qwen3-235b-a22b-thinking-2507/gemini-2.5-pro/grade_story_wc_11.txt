<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (ignoring/shattering/sweeping violin) reveal hierarchy of values with reset cost. Strength: embodied epiphany via "G-string flat" memory. Weakness: limited physicality for "composed" trait beyond calm error bypass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("loop broken," "snow undisturbed"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through timeline density. Minor BRR excess on "procedure" backstory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ice violin) constrains choices (reset mechanics) and charges closure image. Strength: sensory specificity ("fractured rainbows," "cold became one"). Weakness: courtyard lacks deeper mirroring of internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (looped strategy evolution) with unmistakable cost (irreversible loop break). "Cold of courtyard/ice became one" crystallizes stakes reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "G-string flat" memory shows rather than tells how thoughts originate. Final image ("perfect note from forgotten song") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("optical sensors," "manipulator claws") modulates to lyrical during amalgamation. Strength: syntax shifts mirror consciousness expansion. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; peak beats achieve maximum density ("reality dissolved... gentle unfurling"). Final line crystallizes closure without muddle. Hairline "long-term goal" tell excused for efficiency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ice violin as "thought frozen into reality" transforms time-loop trope. Emotional truth in mundane memory avoids cliché. Risk-taking (machine POV) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
