<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Silas’s reticence versus desperate action; embodied emotion via sea glass handling avoids label-speak. Final stone-circle choice earns closure through prior causality, though secondary pressure absent with no keeper interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("luminescent ache," logbook farewell) under Accumulative lens. Storm-fueled escalation tightens options meaningfully, but the keeper’s departure lacks on-page causal friction beyond the log entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea glass constrains choices (pocketed during climb) and charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate. Storm-churned cove and slick stairs pressure tactics, though lantern room description edges toward postcard without altering the repair sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve connection) tightens when light fails, driving agency through storm ascent. Cost is legible in the logbook’s "My watch is over," but escalation lacks a second pressure point; the repair feels mechanically smooth despite emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final sea glass image ("all the light and all the ache") resonates as non-literal answer to connection’s fragility without moralizing. Theme emerges from stone/sea glass particulars, avoiding abstraction—no thematic echo or forced binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in selective storm details ("churning black water," spyglass warmth). Rhythmic control under pressure ("fought his way down," "slick, winding ascent") with zero head-hopping, though reflection on routine slightly dilutes present immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("bucked," "falter," "spark"). "Luminescent ache" risks slight abstraction but is redeemed by immediate sea glass action. Final line’s recharged motif avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-language trope through specific stakes (protection vs. farewell). Emotional truth in Silas’s quiet desperation avoids safety-middle, though the "ghost" setup feels slightly derivative despite deft resolution.</comment>
