<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's embodied obsession with the water-damaged program shows concrete motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses (e.g., fear of desecration vs. need to know). Final choice to play the music earns closure through visible cost of destroying the artifact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "sodden program" lifted from water crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in stain patterns, orientation anchored by "orchestra pit" and "floodwaters" within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded hall functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—water enables climax via capillary action. "Glassy surface" pressure shapes Elias's pivotal decision, though "skeletal ribs" slightly edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (deciphering ghost's code) tightens through Elias's agency: disrupting water's stillness creates irreversible cost (ruined program). Escalation driven by his realization that "spirit was in the water itself" forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water-as-medium metaphor without moralizing. Final image ("hush of unstruck chords gave way to living symphony") reweights "in between spaces" as resonant non-literal answer to communication beyond death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical framing ("tide-like stains," "frantic melody unspooled"), but "wordless conversation" recurs mechanically. Voice modulates effectively from reverent study to urgent action under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding in climax: "water greedily climbing" to "glistening ink" sequence drives propulsion with concrete verbs. Only minor deduction for "frustratingly incomplete" abstraction where showing failed attempts would strengthen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through water-damage mechanic—stains as musical notation feels inevitable yet fresh. Emotional specificity in "final, desperate message sent across decades" avoids abstraction, though risk-taking stays within literary norms.</comment>
