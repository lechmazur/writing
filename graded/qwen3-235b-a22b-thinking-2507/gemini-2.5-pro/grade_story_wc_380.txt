<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in visceral loss; embodied emotion in "ghost of Elara’s warmth fading from his skin" avoids therapy-speak. Slight tell in backstory exposition risks summary, but micro-choices (placing book, reaching into gravity) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density tightening toward Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in "ghost of Elara’s warmth fading" with conceptual price: memory fragments are fleeting. Orientation anchors by 50 words; no causality breaks in high-stakes ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt chamber micro-setting constrains choice (crystals refract light for divination) and charges final image ("glittering indifferently"). Wildflowers book and coffee grounds function as tactile anchors. Sensory specificity ("brine drip," "wool blanket scratch") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim memories) tightens through ritual escalation; cost is visceral when memory vanishes immediately. Agency in "pushing past chilling pressure" forecloses easy hope. "Fluctuates mysteriously" trait creates trade-off: proximity enables contact but guarantees loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt/wildflower particulars; final image reweights "hope" as fragile but earned without moralizing. "They weren’t annihilated, only lost" crystallizes conceptual repricing. Avoids thematic echo via sensory immersion ("crushed lavender," "salt-laced air cleaner").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "salt crystals resonating with inaudible choir"; rhythm modulates from "soft clink" to gasping intensity. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during memory surge. Lexicon stays within keeper’s plausible scope ("divination," "eddy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minimal loops; "gleaming silence" slightly cliché but redeemed by context. Propulsion via strong verbs ("curdling," "congealed," "exhume"). Final line’s "one memory at a time" avoids sentimentality through concrete action. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief physics via salt chamber ritual; avoids memory-loss tropes through specific tools (coffee grounds, wildflowers). Risk-taking heightens stakes: cosmic scale grounded in tactile details. Transformation test passed—replace whale/salt with generic magic breaks logic.</comment>
