<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (primal scream vs. calm focus) under pressure; "borrowed sorrow" borders on label-speak but redeemed by embodied details like "tasted salt of mourner’s tears." Final choice earned through prior obsession with "harnessing the ephemeral," though minor register drift in "psychic residue" slightly weakens authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: protagonist captures the priestess’ peace while accepting death, with cost legible in "my breath grew ragged... but my mind was calm." Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—psychic noise intensifies until the crystalline thread reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Temple setting actively constrains choices: phosphorescent algae enable visibility, obsidian altar reflects light, crushing pressure necessitates the distress signal. Final image—"vial held tight to my chest" against "profound empty silence"—charges closure through environmental specificity. Only deduction: "liquid midnight" slightly clichéd.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (capture pure silence vs. survival) escalates through Accumulative/Textural pressure: oxygen alarm strobes as psychic storm intensifies. Protagonist’s agency—overriding instinct to "search for a current"—narrowing options with visible cost (death). Cost proof: "power reserves flatlined" directly links to closure’s calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: priestess’ "serene acceptance... giving thanks for beauty" reframes the quest as communion, not conquest. Final line ("it was a perfect memory, and now, it was mine") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Zero thematic echo—wisdom earned through struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientist notices "resonant frequencies" yet feels "cold stone under priest’s bare feet." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from staccato ("It lunged. A maelstrom...") to lyrical ("pearlescent glow"). Minor deduction: "psychic residue" slightly academic for high-stress moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances tension. "Phantom pain, borrowed sorrow" avoids therapy-speak through concrete verbs. Only microscopic flaw: "frantic digital heartbeat" slightly mixed metaphor, but doesn’t obscure closure’s propulsion. Rhythm varies perfectly with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "mad scientist" trope through specific constraints: capturing silence as tangible, death as completion. Fresh inflection: gathered hush "lunges," requiring active "unsnarling." Emotional truth in "not trophy but companion" elevates beyond surface novelty. Risk-taking (lyric climax without physical action) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
