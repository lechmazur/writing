<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority anchors in embodied detail ("cold sweat of claustrophobia beading") with contradictory impulses (duty vs. panic) driving the phase transition choice. Final renunciation of haunting earns through prior causality but lacks deeper flaw confrontation beyond fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "chest feeling impossibly open" crystallizes cost of enduring claustrophobia to release ghosts. Hybrid lens (causal pressure + textural accumulation) holds through tidal urgency and sensory payoff. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment constrains every choice: tidal timeframe forces action, collapsing corridor necessitates phase shift. "Crashing hush" evolves into "true hush" to charge the final image. Sensory details (ozone taste, granite pressure) filter through Elias’s claustrophobic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: tidal deadline → physical blockage → phase transition risk. Cost is visceral (claustrophobic panic) and conceptual (enduring "ghost in his own right" to grant others peace). Agency drives escalation without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "standing by the unremembered" resolves not in salvation but peaceful release. Final image ("alone, but no longer haunted") reweights duty as closure without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous dial stark green against twilight gray") modulates under stress with rhythmic control. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("he felt the pressure") in phase transition beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("drip-drip-drip of water seeping") but paraphrase loop in "crashing hush where the roar... met dead silence" creates mild scaffold. No figurative muddle; final line’s "true hush" resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: undersea cables as ghost vessels transformed through tidal pressure and codex fleck specificity. Risks lyrical closure but earns coherence through causal stakes. Near-echo of "unremembered" trope offset by concrete facility logic.</comment>
