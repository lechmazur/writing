<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "small" voice gaining strength and Kael’s combative tenderness masking belief. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak ("tremor in his hands" not "he was anxious"). Final choice earned by tea-reading causality, but "resilience is not the absence of knots" risks label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elara’s scroll-restacking renounces escape with visible cost ("rebuilding, even in a forgotten place"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density tightening stakes. Orientation clear by 50 words; one meaningful deepening (tea reading) sufficient. Cost proof: "kneeling to restack" crystallizes the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crystalline cube, tea dregs, scrolls) constrains choices and charges the final image. Dust motes and playground swing anchor time/space economically. Library’s tactile details ("velvet pedestal," "scuffing floorboards") reflect character priorities. Lacks one persistent constraint (e.g., light fading) to reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (returning home) signaled by "reversible exile" and shadow trap. Escalation via tea-reading deepens knowledge ("key made of loss") and narrows options. Cost legible in Elara’s renunciation of escape. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but timeframe pressure (swing’s breeze) remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "knots" metaphor evolves from frustration to "rebuilding" wisdom without moralizing. Final image reweights "reversible exile" into earned resilience. No thematic echo; complexity in Kael’s broken mentorship. Resonant non-literal answer: home is built through patience, not forgotten faces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Elara notices Kael’s "fractured gaze," the swing’s "rhythmic creak." Rhythm modulates from sharp ("chisel against stone") to focused intensity during tea reading. Zero POV slippage; dialogue carries subtext ("You are not him"). Late "quiet roar" slightly abstract but redeemed by embodied action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure-touching artifacts; "tumbled to the floor with a soft thud" avoids filter verbs. High density: "tapestry of fine, silvery scars" conveys history economically. Minor synonym churn in "furious precision"/"ragged bursts" but no momentum drag. Final line’s "kneeling" crystallizes propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "reversible exile" trope transformed through tea-leaf geometry and mirror-scarred archivist. Emotional specificity in Kael’s backwards retreat. Avoids safety-middle via combative tenderness. One risk: shadow-in-glass concept slightly familiar, but "afternoon shadow" specificity and integration with tea ritual elevates it.</comment>
