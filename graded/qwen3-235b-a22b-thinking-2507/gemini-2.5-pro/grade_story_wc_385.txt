<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in maternal void drives action; embodied sorrow in "shard of glass" line avoids therapy-speak. Lacks contradictory impulses beyond quest focus, limiting 9+ potential despite strong micro-choices with seashell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with tear-and-understanding cost. Orientation clear by word 30; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to crystal resolution without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus actively constrains choices via echo mechanics; seashell’s physical warmth shifts meaning across beats to charge final image. Micro-setting mastery with zero ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when seashell clarifies "Unfinished," narrowing options toward crystal resolution. Cost legible in tear and purpose shift, but escalation lacks sufficient protagonist-driven pressure spikes for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image of Lyra as "finisher of songs" reweights echoes as cosmic debt without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through seashell-crystal union, avoiding any thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Marrow of her bones" perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure flawless. Voice modulates from quiet mist to resonant understanding without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "shard of glass" slightly clichéd but redeemed by context. Minor density dip in "webs of intrigue" line prevents 9.5+, yet propulsion remains relentless toward closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms echo trope through cosmic debt mechanic; "necessary melancholy" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes via Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity.</comment>
