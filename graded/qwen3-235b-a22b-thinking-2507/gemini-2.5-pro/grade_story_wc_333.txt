<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief ("voice thin in vast quiet") and motivation clarity, but Locksmith lacks contradictory impulses; his "unassumingly bold" trait drives action without internal friction at pivotal dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flawless Charged Poise closure: "silence where terrible longing had once been" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through starlight-to-dissolution progression; cosmic hush timing creates irreplaceable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus actively constrains work (requires twilight starlight), while hair lock as micro-setting charges closure via dissolution into "spun glass" filaments. Salt stones aren't decorative—they enable the ritual's spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through hair's disintegration: fear's expectation of "direct assault" makes dissolution's pressure credible. Visible cost in mother's transformed expression ("grief to peaceful awe") forecloses her longing path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "ideas were living things" isn't stated but proven by symphony's release. Final image ("drifting on solar winds") resonantly answers "enveloped secrets" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ozone tang" and "frayed ribbon" details. Rhythm modulates perfectly—longer sentences during setup, staccato beats at climax ("ribbon untied itself"). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored in Locksmith's focused intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or artifacts; "shimmering chaotic lattice" does triple duty (image/conflict/theme). Final line recharges opening "ghost of melody" with devastating economy. Figurative language only where essential (starlight as "spun glass").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms locksmith trope via cosmic mechanics: hair lock as prison dissolves through resonance, not force. Emotional truth in "fear expecting direct assault" avoids derivative safety; specificity ("blue ribbon," "solar winds") grounds universality.</comment>
