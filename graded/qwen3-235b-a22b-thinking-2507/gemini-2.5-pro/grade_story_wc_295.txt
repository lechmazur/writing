<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elian's scientific observer vs. emotional inheritor duality; "frantic energy subsided" embodies earned calm through micro-choice with the pen, avoiding therapy-speak. Slight over-tidiness in emotional resolution at dawn prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "burden no longer his alone to carry" crystallizes conceptual cost with the telegram's reweighted meaning. Accumulative lens holds through stellar lament revelation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: telescope's "cold copper eyepiece" and RR Lyrae's pulse constrain Elian's actions and charge the final dawn image. Observatory remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elian's agency observing RR Lyrae, transforming "decode" to "witness" with visible cost in trembling hands. Dominant stake (solving vs. understanding grief) deepens perfectly under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"The sorrow is not yours alone" evolves from maddening phrase to resonant truth through stellar lament, avoiding moralizing. Final image (telegram as promise) answers central question without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stellar heartbeat," "glowing ideograms") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control in dream descent ("shimmering motes," "void rushed in") teaches pattern early for closure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "fragile as a moth’s wing" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor abstraction in "profound and enveloping calm" lacks full embodiment, but final line's "midnight solace lasted until dawn" rescues propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "decoding ancient text" trope through grief-lament angle; stellar variable stars as language feels fresh. Emotional specificity in "shared cosmic loneliness" avoids generic templates.</comment>
