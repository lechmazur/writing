<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: empiricist seeking "miracle" through math. Embodied micro-choices like "frugality of movements was hypnotic" avoid label-only emotion. Final dismantling earns covenant with visible cost—sacrificing public validation for private truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: ritual density tightens options until revelation. Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost—"leaving no trace" crystallizes his renunciation. "Low resonant hum" makes conceptual cost undeniable without melodrama.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian dust circle constrains every choice (no wasted grains) and charges closure: sweeping it "back into clay pot" mirrors his frugality. "Violet sky" and "gossamer structure" avoid generic symbolism by shaping tangible actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("seal covenant with unknown") and pressure accumulates via ritual precision. Cost is unmistakable in dismantling—foreclosing public recognition. Interregnum timeframe ("terrestrial chaos") creates live clock narrowing his window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "encrypted devotion" as lived practice, not moralizing. Final image—"treasure kept safe in vault of quiet mind"—resonates as non-literal answer to covenant, reweighting "frugality" as sacred preservation without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is astronomer-specific: noticing "dusky harmony," starlight "thickening." Syntax modulates perfectly under pressure—lyrical for ritual, taut for climax. Zero POV leakage; voice remains distinct even during revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hoarded silence and starlight" does triple duty establishing character/stakes/atmosphere. Figurative language sparse but potent ("tomb awaiting new corpse"). Final line’s "vault of quiet mind" charges closure without summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empiricist mystic avoids tropes. Risk-taking (quiet ritual over drama) heightens stakes—revelation is silent, personal. Closure choice (dismantling altar) feels inevitable yet surprising, transforming "frugality" into sacred act.</comment>
