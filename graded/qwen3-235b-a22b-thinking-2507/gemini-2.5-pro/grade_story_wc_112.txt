<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s obliging nature versus quiet vertigo at multitudes; embodied emotion ("falling sideways into an ocean of possibility") avoids labels. Aris’s obsession feels lived-in but lacks secondary pressure beyond the lever pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("icy air now felt like a cradle") under causal lens; orientation anchors by 100 words. Escalation via lever pull narrows options cleanly—no redundancy or soft resets mar the decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tool-as-setting (hydro-spanner) constrains choice and charges closure via Elias’s hands; "mechanically warm" energy evolves from device detail to emotional metaphor. Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors mechanic’s POV—crystalline wings, oiled click.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving lateral time) tightens via lever pull’s irreversible action; cost is Elias’s re-calibrated soul. Agency-driven escalation lacks only one visible loss (e.g., stamina or tool) to hit 9.0 band, though conceptual cost remains undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystalline wings folding and hydro-spanner echo—no moralizing. Final image ("cradle holding multitudes") reweights "icy warmth" as non-literal answer to time’s nature, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in mechanic’s tactile focus ("calloused fingers," "hydro-spanner"); rhythm compresses under stress ("profound quiet vertigo"). Aris’s dialogue stays distinct (theoretical jargon) without convergence at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ocean of possibility" metaphor deepens without muddle. Final line ("re-calibrated forever") recharges "icy warmth" with maximum density. No figurative overwriting even in high-pressure beats—every verb propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope via subdued awakenings and lepidoptera plains. Emotional specificity in quiet vertigo avoids generic awe; risk-taking in denying spectacle ("no flash of light") heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
