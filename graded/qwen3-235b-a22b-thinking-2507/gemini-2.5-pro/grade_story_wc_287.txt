<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wistfully pragmatic") embodied through action; micro-choices like tying fishing line reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance earns closure with felt cost of sustained vulnerability, though father's backstory slightly edges toward convenient motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: Henderson's slit-blind response reconfigures options with conceptual cost of fragile connection. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density intensifies through nightly ritual, narrowing Elara's world to the pendulum rhythm until the infinitesimal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lockmaster's tooth functions as micro-setting: its precise size constrains Elara's delicate action and charges the final image. Harbor moonlight isn't passive backdrop—it actively enables the tooth's transformation into "tiny, brilliant star," making light a tactile tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency: the "oar-stroke rhythm" becomes a narrowing constraint as cold intensifies. Henderson's slit-blind response carries visible cost—her "breath she hadn’t realized she was holding shuddered out"—reconfiguring solitude without false resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "reflect light into dark corners" transforms from creed to the tooth's silver fleck. Final image ("tiny, reflected promise") reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity where connection is a "breath" not a breakthrough.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "quivering hush" and "salt-laced air" through gardener's tactile lens. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—lyricism tightens to rhythmic simplicity ("pulling and releasing the line") during the pivotal blind-slit moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where every phrase advances atmosphere ("velvet against cold iron"). Minor risk in "quivering hush" abstraction, but immediately grounded by harbor's "rippling silver," preserving propulsion toward the tooth's kinetic dance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Locksmith/gardener duality transforms "light in darkness" trope through specific occupational logic. The tooth's recontextualization—from keepsake to beacon—feels inevitable yet fresh, with emotional truth in the infinitesimal victory of a widened slit.</comment>
