<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian's embodied interiority shines ("breath a lonely cloud"), but lacks contradictory impulses; Lyra remains spectral executor without agency, reducing relationship crucible impact. Final choice lacks visible micro-choice hierarchy despite strong emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("sudden, absolute silence"), but bead discovery relies on coincidence rather than causal pressure. Lens (Hybrid) holds through climax, though setup-to-bead leap weakens escalation under Causal demands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: stone bead constrains choices (unlocking memories) and charges final image ("warm stone bead clutched tightly"). Orchid's bloom physically manifests thematic cost (acid dew), avoiding static symbolism through lived-in integration with Elian's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens through bloom's crescendo, but Lyra's agency drives escalation rather than Elian's choices. Cost ("sorrowful splendor" dissolving) is legible, yet protagonist's endurance lacks active trade-offs under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lovingly venomous" toxicity/nurturance duality without moralizing. Final image reweights debt as legacy ("work... just beginning"), but "fulfilled vow" phrasing edges toward sentimentality, slightly diluting earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors deepening to jewel-like intensity") modulates with tension. Rhythmic control under climax ("unfurled its petals, releasing...") avoids loops, though "impossible vibrancy" risks generic abstraction in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("chime echoed not in ears but in marrow"). "Winter-cracked fields" shows textural specificity, but "lovingly venomous" appears twice with minimal variation, triggering minor scaffold penalty in peak escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alchemy/ghost tropes transformed via debt-as-legacy framework. Stone bead's irreplaceable properties (spiral pulling light) charge closure, but "foolish war" backstory lacks fresh inflection, anchoring in familiar tragic-love conventions.</comment>
