<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices—shaking hands versus dawn observations—without therapy-speak. Final kiln relighting earns closure via prior causality (week of frost alignment), with visible cost in enduring the cold dawns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "She no longer feared the flame" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—frost pattern density escalates pressure without causal breaks. Smugglers' motive ambiguity avoids causality rupture by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon walls and frost patterns actively constrain choices (shaded rock positioning, river reeds), charging the final image where ice geometry is etched into glass. Micro-setting (cobalt shard's ice lace) drives the key realization beat with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen's agency: dawn observations deepen knowledge, narrowing options to retracing the path. Cost is unmistakable—physical endurance of pre-sun colds forecloses hiding from fire, reshaping her kiln relighting as reclamation, not regression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: frost patterns reweighting silence as "conversation" avoids moralizing. Final image ("silence was a conversation she finally understood") offers resonant, non-literal answer to trauma's purpose, embracing complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("artist’s eye sparking") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato sentences for fire trauma ("The fire was no longer a tool"), flowing cadence for frost epiphany—without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "webbed with delicate lacework of ice" fuses image and tension. Figurative language sparse but potent ("ghost-heat," "shifting page"), with closure beat ("melting away the delicate map") crystallizing cost through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma narrative via glass artist’s lens transforms tropes—ice as smugglers' cipher feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes: quiet closure foregoes confrontation for earned reconfiguration, anchored by canyon’s physical logic.</comment>
