<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("never understand" rule vs forbidden knowledge pursuit) embodied in physical headache and bathroom ritual; micro-choice to pocket cameo drives crisis. Final clarity earned through prior causality with visible cost ("bewilderment replaced by terrible clarity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "dizzying, perfect, terrifying loop" crystallized in bathroom scene. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orchard's "frantic chaos" pressure tightens via sensory density to final realization. Orientation anchored by line 3 ("lonely asteroid").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bathroom micro-setting (ceramic sink, recycled water) constrains Kaelen's breakthrough and charges final image: droplets as "miniature nebulae" reprise becomes "orchard waiting." Tool (pistachio shell) directly alters tactics when laid on counter, triggering epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (understanding temporal paradox) tightens through Accumulative lens: headache pressure and cameo's "hum" escalate to bathroom breakthrough. Cost legible in "dizzying loop" and "low thrum" transformed; agency lies in inquiry method forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through temporal cameo epiphany: "emptiness wasn't void; it was gift" reweights inheritance without moralizing. Final image ("orchard waiting") resonates as non-literal answer to central question, charged by prior "brightened disquiet" evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ghost-silver branches blossomed with starlight" filtered through curator's scientific awe. Rhythmic control under pressure ("slow, inexorable blooming of night-fused flower") with zero head-hopping; bathroom reflection taught early as recurring motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("pocketed the cameo blank and retreated" compresses action/motivation). Propulsion through concrete verbs ("braced," "splashed," "pulled"); "miniature nebulae" metaphor integrates setting/theme without muddle. Final line crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance transformed through biological metaphor ("genetic ghost," "temporal knot"). Pistachio cameo irreplaceable: swapping object breaks "Temporal Bough" logic. Risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in "terrible clarity."</comment>
