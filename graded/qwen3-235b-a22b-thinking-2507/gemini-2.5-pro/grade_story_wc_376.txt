<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied longing ("yearned for candor") drives micro-choices like map reconstruction, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; final seed-planting shows value hierarchy without prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Elian planting the seed amid "air clearing," reconfiguring truth as cultivable. Cost is legible in trembling hands at vault and fern's earlier symbolism, though vault discovery edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse city's toxic smog and recycled air actively constrain choices (e.g., fern detecting dishonesty), while the Veritas Bloom's soil requirement directly charges the ending—environment shapes tactics and final image without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. societal decay) tighten through map reconstruction, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the postal plate's discovery feels coincidental rather than earned agency, weakening the cost's causal weight despite resonant ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shredded map fragments become "lost conversations," seeds literalize "oasis of honesty." Final image reweights truth as growable without moralizing, though "authenticity of the past" phrasing slightly abstracts the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in calligrapher-specific details ("gilded-leaf," "nutrient-paste lamps"), but stress-induced compression falters—Elian's vault discovery lacks sensory narrowing, diluting urgency in peak pressure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density ("a sweet poison on the recycled air"), but final paragraph's "oasis of honesty" and "million tiny conversations" border on thematic echo, slightly muddling the earned subtlety of earlier imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms treasure-map trope into ecological truth-cultivation; specificity of "Silver-Vein fern" and "zinc-etched postal plate" grounds metaphor. Risk-taking in quiet closure feels inevitable through prior textural accumulation.</comment>
