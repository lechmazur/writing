<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("sand slipping" vs "timeless" urn); final choice (pressing fragment) earns closure with visible cost shift ("gnawing sense... vanished"). Slight abstraction in "profound contentment" redeemed by concrete sensory flood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly under Accumulative lens: willow message triggers resonator payoff with unmistakable cost ("borrowed time vanished"). "Pressed fragment against panel" causal trigger taught early via silo's "translucent" panel detail. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "glowing green walls" become "library of lost feelings." Urn fragment constrains climax choice ("pressed against panel") and appears warm in final image. "World forgot how to count" lacks concrete constraint but compensated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (understanding time's texture) tightens meaningfully: garage sale attempts → willow message clue → silo resonance resolution. Kael's agency drives escalation ("devised method," "scrambled back"). Cost legible in anxiety's replacement by serenity. Traveler's message feels earned by "resonator" setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "willow remembers sun" message charges closure without moralizing. Final image ("library of lost feelings") offers resonant answer to "texture of time" quest. "Mystery solved" borders on telling but redeemed by "thousand other mysteries" reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature crystalline: "thinning of light within his own bones" embodies time anxiety. Rhythm modulates from languid opening to urgent "scrambled back" to serene closure. Zero head-hopping; voice stays Kael's even in lyrical moments like "pocket of existence outside the flow."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do triple duty ("life measured in years he could no longer comprehend" advances plot/theme). "Moment washed through him" shows high density without muddle. Minor abstraction in "profound contentment" redeemed by preceding tactile details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through tactile specificity: ceramic shard as memory conduit, garage sale as poetic lifeline. "Borrowed time" redefined as bone-light not clock metaphor. Risk-taking (poetic causality) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
