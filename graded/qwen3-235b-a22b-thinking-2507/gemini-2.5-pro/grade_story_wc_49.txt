<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (tinkerer vs ritualist) with embodied emotion ("fingers trembled"), but motivation for restoring practices lacks deeper friction beyond village's "listlessness," slightly underdeveloping the cost of lifelong work ahead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost ("lifelong work ahead") as the saturated arbor reconfigures the village's memory burden—no causality breaks in the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arbor's lattice actively channels the vine's growth, and "weathered wood" of the central post charges the final image; micro-setting constrains choice when the tendril weaves through overhead lattice under time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Escalation driven by Elian's agency (adjusting dissonant notes) under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in "lifelong work" foreclosing solitary ritual; dominant stake (cultural memory) tightens via moon's descent and sonic precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "reset the clock that kept his people’s heart" reweights cultural memory without moralizing; final image of illuminated path offers non-literal answer to amnesia, avoiding abstraction through golden stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tinkerer’s ear detecting dissonance") with rhythmic control modulating from "low thrum" to "resonant chant"; minor register drift in "ramblings of oldest grandmothers" slightly jars voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("coalesce and spin golden stories" multiplies meaning) with propulsion matching ritual intensity; mixed metaphor ("coalesce/spin") is purposeful and legible within poetic context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "tuning the world" reframes cultural restoration as sonic calibration; avoids trope through specific mechanics (vine as memory conduit), though "whimsical tinkerer" risks slight abstraction without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
