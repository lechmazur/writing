<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Julian's "bitterness" versus his embodied realization of "cosmically stupid" grief; the sapling metamorphosis forces micro-choices (leaving arrowhead) that foreclose his mission with visible cost. Avoids therapy-speak through concrete actions like clutching the phone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Julian's stance crystallizes when setting down the phone, with "frostbitten hope blooming" reweighting the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors immediately in "damp, cool earth" with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underground garden constrains every choice—the phone ritual only functions within its "gravitationally playful" physics, and the weeping willow sapling directly charges the final image of "frostbitten hope." Sensory details like "soil under her nails" reflect Julian's grief-driven perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Julian's agency: witnessing the man's metamorphosis forces his worldview shift, narrowing options to abandon his mission. The cost—leaving the arrowhead—alters tactics immediately, with the phone's "heavy" weight embodying the conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the willow sapling's "trembling leaves" and "frostbitten hope" offer non-literal resolution to "bitterness," avoiding moralizing. Julian's "cosmic joke" realization reweights the central conflict without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("placid, unnerving silence of a forest after fire") and rhythmic control during metamorphosis ("limbs elongated and branched") deepen pressure. No head-hopping; compression of Julian's shift taught early via garden's "strange rhythm."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "residual energy" humming in the arrowhead delivers high density without muddle. Final line "frostbitten hope bloomed" recharges the willow image with crystalline propulsion, avoiding overwriting even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via specific logic: cordless phone/static ritual grounded in the garden's physics, not whimsy. "Frostbitten hope" synthesizes emotional truth with the setting's rules, avoiding middle-ground hedging through Julian's earned stance shift.</comment>
