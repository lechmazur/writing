<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("temptation of despair" vs "transformation, not surrender") drives micro-choices like selecting fragmented sensory details. Embodied exhaustion ("strain of creation a physical weight") avoids label-speak while showing cost. Final choice to continue is earned by rejecting hollow replicas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with visible cost: "profound exhaustion of a god" and "thousands of other darkened lanterns" make the lifelong labor undeniable. Accumulative lens holds from "working memory" focus to final image reweighting "forgotten constellations" into active lights.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Paper lanterns evolve from "skeletons" to vessels for memory, constraining Kaelen's method (fragments over wholes). The amber bottle's micro-setting function charges closure—its "sealed nature" embodies the immutable past while enabling rebirth. Sensory details like "scorched sugar" directly fuel action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (authentic revival vs false comfort) tightens through Kaelen's exhaustion and the "thousands of darkened lanterns." Agency in selecting memories ("rough texture of a net") narrows options visibly. Cost is physical and temporal—"agonizing" work spanning "the rest of his life."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the amber bottle's sealed tear reweights "forgotten constellations" into reborn lights. Avoids moralizing; the final image answers "can remembrance rebuild civilization?" by showing lights replacing emptiness without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crucible of his own mind," "solidified tear") reflects an alchemist's precision under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("tired sigh of the tide") to staccato ("One.") during creation. Zero POV slippage; stress compresses diction without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances texture ("skeletons of lanterns" evolves into literal vessels). Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction: "agonizing, but it was real." Minor deduction for "profound emptiness" being slightly abstract, but compensated by concrete follow-up.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost town revival" through alchemical specificity: memory fragments as volatile laboratory. Irreplaceable synthesis where "scorched sugar" and net textures make revival feel earned. Risk-taking in agonizingly slow process heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
