<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "yearned to thaw frost" yet "no longer knew shape of honest words"; micro-choices (polishing lens, keeping tickets) reveal hierarchy of values. Transformation slightly too neat in tear moment, lacking grit in pivotal thaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "mistrust did not vanish... first delicate thaw" crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—ticket accumulation drives pressure to park revelation. Orientation flawless by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projector lens functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (magnifying doodles) and charges finale (placed in palm). "Crystal whispering forecourt" evolves from opening image to park setting, mirroring emotional resonance without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (mistrust) signaled early; escalation via ticket accumulation narrows options to park confrontation. Cost legible in "thaw" description, but Elias' decision to follow feels slightly convenient—pressure could deepen before turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: wing-key doodles reweight grief as "confessions without vocabulary." Final image ("freed by honesty needing no words") answers central question without moralizing—earned through concrete actions, zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Elias notices "lonely precision" of clock, "slick dark patterns" on granite. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences in park scene). Near-miss: "dense, ringing silence" borders on abstract for peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ship on sea of clocks" compresses years of grief). Minor artifact: "crystal whispering" repetition lacks variation, slightly dulling closure image’s freshness without harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silent communication via concert tickets transforms grief tropes. Risk-taking (zero dialogue) heightens stakes—closure hinges on tactile exchange of lens. Specificity (charcoal sketching on cenotaph) avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
