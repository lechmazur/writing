<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("phantom limb aching with lost sensation"), but Kaelen's core flaw (dreamlessness) isn't tested through contradictory impulses until closure. Micro-choice to transform memory rather than erase it earns Earned Stasis, yet prior struggle lacks visible tactical cost beyond emotional tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Charged Poise: crystalline tree crystallizes options with conceptual cost (end of dreamlessness), satisfying Accumulative lens. Pressure builds via sensory density ("pale blooms shivered"), though mid-story deepening relies solely on memory's eruption without secondary complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glowing dune functions as micro-setting: Kaelen's "net cast across sand" directly constrains tactics, while final tree's "pulsed with soft glow" charges closure. Chess clock's frozen hands reweighted against "beginning of a dream" proves environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve archive vs. integrate memory) tightens through physical consequences ("tearing fabric of dune"), narrowing Kaelen to transformation. Cost is legible in "feeling of being everywhere receding," though escalation lacks mid-beat tactical shift beyond the singular embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "You do not have to be what you were" crystallizes synthesis without moralizing. Final tree reweights "cultivate sparks" into earned wisdom, avoiding thematic echo while resonating through sensory particulars (resinous scent mingling with desert air).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-particular metaphors ("fractured lullaby whispered to a feverish child"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—quantum descriptions expand calm beats, while "The violent shuddering ceased" compresses crisis. Zero register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resinous scent mingled with clean, cold air" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "elegant in its complexity" (abstract mid-crisis), but "crystalline structure branching toward starless sky" delivers flawless propulsion in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Divergent archive" trope transformed through tactile execution: quantum physics becomes emotional metaphor ("coaxing probabilities like a musician"). Risk-taking heightens stakes—memory's "scent of pine needles" threatens dune's physics—without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
