<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (dread vs eagerness) but lacks deep flaws; micro-choices under pressure sparse despite gear anchor. Final shift earned but "stray philosopher" archetype stays slightly abstract without inevitable mistakes compounding choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "quiet certainty of discovery" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation to quartz tree climax. Orientation clear by paragraph 1 with deliberate disorientation functional at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest actively constrains choices via wind-sound navigation system (e.g., "serrated ironwood leaves meant water"). Quartz tree symphony charges final image; micro-setting (gear) reweights closure with specificity beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding translocation) tightens through protagonist's active listening, culminating in knowledge-deepening at quartz tree. Agency drives escalation; cost legible in "disorientation settling like dew" shifting to "quiet certainty" with visible emotional tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear symbol's reweighting ("not broken... but complete thing") avoiding moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to "stray vs guided" question with "probable miracles" concept charged by concrete sensory struggle, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chime of wind... miniature bells") with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Lyrical compression taught early pays off; zero head-hopping as voice deepens during insight hum without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brushing fragments of metallic flora" exemplifies textural specificity. Every sentence advances atmosphere or insight; final line recharges opening disorientation with propulsion. Figurative language sparse yet precise in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms translocation trope through mechanical rainforest's tactile logic. "Hum of insight" as vibrational cognition avoids cliché; gear symbol's reweighting feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
