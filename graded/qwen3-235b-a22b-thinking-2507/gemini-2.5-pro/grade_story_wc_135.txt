<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief/hope) drive Kaelen's work; the woman's recognition earns his quiet resolve. Flaw: No visible struggle beyond dedication weakens stakes escalation despite embodied emotion ("flicker of resilience").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: valve discovery → woman's story reweights all fragments as Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable in "failed heroism and final, desperate love" with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor actively constrains tactics (tide schedule dictates "staggered intervals"); ivory stones and valve recur to charge closure. Sensory details filter through archivist's trained eye ("barnacles on pier-posts").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Kaelen's agency: mundane finds → valve's emotional charge → woman proving fragments rebuild meaning. Cost crystallizes in "panicked breath" echo and "failed heroism" with no convenient resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects: "Nothing is ever lost" shown via valve's recognition, not told. Final image ("ready for the next fragment") reweights prior loss with conceptual cost—memory as both burden and lifeline—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water-worn shoes," "barnacle patterns") and rhythmic control: short sentences for action ("He knelt"), lyrical for reflection ("liminal space"). Psychic distance tightens during valve contact ("phantom echo").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("sucking sounds on wet sand") with concrete propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("mosaic of loss"). Final line recharges opening tide imagery without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "archivist" trope through tide-dependent constraints and reactive visions. Emotional truth in "failed heroism" avoids redemption; specificity ("single water-worn shoes") grounds universality. Safety hedge: protagonist lacks meaningful flaws.</comment>
