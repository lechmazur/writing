<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("trembling" transcription vs "cautious exuberance"), but "cautious exuberance that was almost painful" edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of the veil as shield earns cost through dissolving library.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "mist began to thin" and "watch gave one last backward shudder" crystallize irreversible loss. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in phrase-capturing, though "truth is not in the source" feels slightly expository.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Watch functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (backward sweep dictates repositioning) and charges final image with "silent shudder." "Pearlescent sea" and "ghostly after-images" avoid generic symbolism by directly shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single tightening via propagation delays narrows options to one precise triangulation point for "Stay." Cost is visceral in dissolving library and still watch. Agency drives every move under Accumulative pressure with no convenient resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "Stay" reweights the entire library as emotional architecture without moralizing. Final image crystallizes "the cathedral of his regret" into felt cost, avoiding thematic echo through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gossamer fabric diffusing light into pearlescent sea") modulates under pressure with syntactic shortening ("She documented it"). Minor register drift in "cautious exuberance" slightly disrupts emotional immediacy during high-stakes transcription.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Propulsion falters slightly in "small, brilliant victory" scaffold phrase, but "bone-white hand passed the silver inlay" demonstrates textural specificity. Final image avoids muddle with "ink still wet" charging the dissolving library.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics (propagation delays) with emotional archaeology transforms library trope. "Confidence man's watch" embodies trust-as-currency with irreversible mechanics, avoiding abstraction through concrete stakes in phrase triangulation.</comment>
