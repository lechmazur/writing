<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (gentle touch vs 'arms of steel'), but backstory about Kaelen's 'echoes of minds' exceeds BRR limits without altering present tactics, losing micro-choice anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (Ren's empty calm), but reflection past 120 words lacks present-tied micro-choice, triggering orientation penalty that dulls causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (fissure placement) and charges the final image (retrieving tessera for next Retro), satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via textural density (humming light intensifying with Ren's rigidity) reweights mercy's cost, though agency centers on endurance rather than decision; final emptiness provides undeniable legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Ren's hand-turning gesture ('stranger to himself') avoiding moralizing; 'terrible and gentle gift' crystallizes complexity without stating a moral, fulfilling Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('air tasting of static') and rhythmic control during renaming beat, but 'retrocognitively trapped' introduces therapy-speak label that disrupts voice in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, but 'arms of steel' cliché in peak renaming sequence triggers register drift penalty; otherwise high density with clean propulsion through sensory verbs ('hummed,' 'rigid').</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes memory-erasure trope through specific mechanics (lapis tessera as circuit) and emotional truth in Kaelen's conflicted mercy; 'lotus' symbolism transformed by context avoids abstraction.</comment>
