<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hadn't brought his daughter back" versus building solace, but single-POV limits relationship dynamics; embodied grief ("tears trace paths through grime") avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: moon-phase dependency taught early, closure lands as Charged Poise with cost legible in "ache of loss was a physical thing" during activation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Patina bronze foot functions as micro-setting constraining choices (placement timing) and charging closure via "winter dawn" light; signal station's defunct transmitter supplies causal materials.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through moon-phase urgency driving agency; cost unmistakable in "hadn't brought his daughter back" during solace realization, though single escalation limits depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bronze foot's transformation from "cool anchor" to "humming warmth," avoiding moralizing; "raw solace" conclusion offers non-literal answer reweighting grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight felt solid") and rhythmic control under pressure; "patchwork navigator" risks abstraction but saved by concrete actions like gantry climb.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("whispers carried on dead wires" compresses backstory), though "skeleton of forgotten ambition" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief elegy with sci-fi via bronze foot's moon-physics; "reverse migration" concept transformed through tactile dish construction rather than thematic echo.</comment>
