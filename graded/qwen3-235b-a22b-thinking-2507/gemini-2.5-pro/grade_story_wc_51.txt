<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; motivation clear but static ("boundary-lessly trapped" shown not told). Embodied emotion strong ("thumb over wick-raiser knob"), yet micro-choices lack value hierarchy under pressure. Farmer's grief provides external conflict without altering Kaelen's core stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mosaic completion deepens the "shingled hush" with visible cost ("lonely warden... waiting"). Accumulative lens holds—each stone tightens the dominant stake. Orientation clear by 80 words; starlight alignment drives the single meaningful deepening required at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its stillness and starlight constrain Kaelen's actions ("could not take a single step"), directly charging the final image. Lamp burner's brass gallery shapes the calcification tactic. "Shingled hush" evolves from atmosphere to physical weight, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) signaled immediately. Single deepening—the calcification process—narrowing Kaelen's options through precise alignment. Cost legible in enduring solitude ("listening to the thawing world"), though snowmelt timeframe only subtly pressures tactics. Agency consistent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone mosaic: grief transformed into enduring silence without moralizing. Final image ("infinitesimally heavier, deeper silence") reweights "shingled hush" as conceptual cost. Avoids sentimentality via concrete details ("milky-white stone"), offering resonant answer to "weights of burdens" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("psychic current," "whalebone reverie") with rhythmic control under pressure. Syntax modulates from languid description to precise action during calcification. Zero head-hopping; elision (farmer's off-page relief) taught early and paid off in closure's feather-light echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frantic pulse of grief began to slow" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language sparse but potent ("shard of glass in the psychic current"). Final line’s cadence ("listening to the thawing world") resolves with textural specificity. Minor abstraction risk in "whalebone reverie" offset by concrete payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-physical-object trope through starlight alchemy. "Shingled hush" transforms from setting to thematic core via lived detail. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "fractal weaver" concept slightly echoes existing metaphysical frameworks without full transformation.</comment>
