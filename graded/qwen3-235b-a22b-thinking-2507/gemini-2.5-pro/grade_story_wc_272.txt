<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied actions: charcoal dust as cartography tools transforms fragmentation into agency; "luminescent ache" evolves from suffocation to "gentle, knowing glow" with visible cost in the final map.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increase via thread/fragment accumulation culminates in Charged Poise closure where the map’s "quiet, resilient sense" reconfigures meaning; cost is visceral in "hollowed vessel" to "cartographer" shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting as constraint: lighthouse spiral staircase directly shapes the box-splinter arrangement; maritime atlas thread and charcoal dust become tactical tools charging the final image’s "geography of inner world."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: "why fight the current?" rhetorical crisis forces the redesign choice; the "hollowed vessel" cost materializes in his "fingers black with charcoal" as he forgoes mending for reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the floor map offers non-literal answer to "is loss just hollowing?" by showing navigation through fragments; avoids moralizing via "vessel for nothing but absence" transformed into "resilient sense."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "salt-laced dust tasted like failure" filters setting through fractured vision; syntax compresses under stress ("He sat with the fragments, the ache... a luminescent ache") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "brittle spine... cracking like old bone" avoids cliché; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., "He sat back on his heels..."); no synonym loops despite high imagery density in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot archetypes become cartographic tools rather than mystical props; "luminescent ache" as embodied cost avoids abstraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
