<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in peripheral focus method; embodied emotion through pin placement and ledger entries. Final choice earned by accumulated studies, but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation beyond time expenditure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: reactivated mechanism's echo/candlelight reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (fragile wonder against grey stillness). Accumulative lens holds through light-study pattern; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble cavern actively constrains tactics (light angles dictate pin placement) and charges final image (quartz pulse on walls). Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects locksmith's priorities; environment integral to closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder against monochrome silence) deepen through light-study accumulation, but pressure lacks tangible setbacks. Cost legible in "days bled into weeks" yet escalation feels too frictionless for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through mechanics: "cellar of reason" made literal via timer reconstruction. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—"fragments reawaken" answers central question through charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in peripheral observations; rhythmic control shifts from measured study to urgent reconstruction. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early through light-tracking focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystalline gears were shattered, its purpose inert"). Slight register drift in "state of being peripherally focused" deducts 0.2 from potential 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echo harvesting" via light physics; marble's memory-storage logic transforms trope. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ standard.</comment>
