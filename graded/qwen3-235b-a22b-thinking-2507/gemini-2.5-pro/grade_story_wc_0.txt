<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("spike of pure grief" vs seeking detachment) acts simultaneously in orchid scene; final shovel choice earned through micro-choices like returning daily. Slight acceleration of emotional shift prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (wiping dust then turning to shovel) crystallizes stance with felt cost ("unfiltered reality was jarring... full of purpose"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density of decay observations reweighting the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dust-coated pane actively constrains choice (enabling the orchid-weed realization) and charges the final image (wiping clean). Micro-setting specificity ("pearlescent light" of scales) elevates beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single deepening (orchid water feeding weed) narrows options under Accumulative lens, making detachment impossible. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral "shattering" of detachment and final shovel decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (orchid's water transfer), not abstraction. Final image reweights "chaos" as "purpose" without moralizing, satisfying Q5 9+ test through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("practiced eye of a man who appreciated fine structures") modulates from sterile to humble under pressure. Rhythmic control in epiphany beat ("life consumes death to continue") avoids ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("ghostly tapestry" > "preprocess reality"). Minor deduction for "irrational grief" bordering label-speak, but "spike" embodiment prevents major penalty in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist learns emotion" trope via butterfly-dust lens device. Fresh inflection in decay-as-transfer concept, with orchid-weed observation feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
