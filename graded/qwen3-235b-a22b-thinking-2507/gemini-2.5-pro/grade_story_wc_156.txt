<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "dull desire to return" vs growing exhilaration; micro-choices like the "final complex gesture" reveal value hierarchy with cost in rejecting cerulean. Avoids diagnostic labels despite high-stakes shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the mirror-reflected eye and "something that rings" crystallize irreversible cost of embracing uncertainty. Accumulative lens holds through sound-density escalation; orientation anchored in 38 words ("restorer of vivid murals... scaffold").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active micro-setting—amber dish vs blue spire directly constrain Elias' reality-shifting tactics. Bioluminescence shift charges the final turpentine return, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' escalating coin experiments, culminating in the seven-structure sequence that forces irreversible trade: cerulean certainty for resonant uncertainty. Cost is visible in his abandonment of predictable craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the nickel's evolving carvings reweight "certainty vs curiosity" without moralizing. Final line "something that rings" resonates as non-literal answer to the apprentice's question, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("absorbed by his bones," "liquid twilight") reflects Elias' artistic POV. Rhythm modulates perfectly—from clipped panic to flowing play—without head-hopping. Non-standard "bewitch itself" reads intentional under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "waterfall of light" avoids cliché through concrete action. Minor deduction for "the world bewitch itself" (grammar slip in high-pressure beat), but propulsion remains flawless with dense multi-jobbing lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes physics and artistry through specific lived detail: sound-refraction mechanics transform mural restoration metaphor. Risk in compressing lifetimes into a pause pays off through the nickel's tangible transformations.</comment>
