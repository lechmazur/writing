<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; motivation clear but emotional progression slightly abstract in climax ("whispered 'Hold'") lacks embodied contradiction beyond focus/despair. Micro-choices under pressure strong but flaw integration lacks visible struggle beyond technical precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (slide's inertness, "exhausted" casket) under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by paragraph 2; pressure deepens via light's decay without causal breaks. One meaningful intensification suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonator machine (tool) constrains choices (tuning dials, breath fogging) and charges final image ("tombstone and a seed"). Sensory hierarchy flawless—cold breath matters, quartz hush affects movement—avoiding generic "frozen library" tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (preserving vow's essence) signaled immediately; pressure tightens as light frays, narrowing options to one frequency capture. Cost unmistakable in dead slide and "Extinguished" casket. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonator data as "tombstone and a seed"—non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality; "lexicon of essences" reweights vow's meaning through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices light patterns, cold breath, machine hum. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fingers flew... tuning sampler") with intentional compression. Zero POV slippage; lexicon consistent with archivist's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thin as winter's first ice" shows textural specificity. Minor register drift in "symphony collapsing into discordant noise" (slightly cliché vehicle) but doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion flawless in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archival trope via resonator physics—vows as measurable frequencies. "Tombstone and seed" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("magic lantern slide for vows") avoids abstraction.</comment>
