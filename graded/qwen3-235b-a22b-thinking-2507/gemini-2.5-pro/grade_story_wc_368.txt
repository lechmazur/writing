<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (dye master precision vs. emotional curiosity) drives micro-choices like approaching with wing, but donor heart's influence lacks deeper flaw integration; "valley-mist wonder" embodies emotion without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in "quiet, explosive knowledge" of perceptual shift; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through light-trail accumulation toward final prismatic reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chalk-drawn sun trails and morpho wing function as micro-setting that charges closure image, but floating tea house remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices or supplying resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One meaningful deepening (light behavior observations) narrows options to systematic tracking; cost is irreversible perceptual shift, though stakes lack visceral friction despite intellectual agency driving escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through refracted light motif; final prismatic realization avoids moralizing while reweighting "magnetize stories" with conceptual cost, no thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dye master's perceptual signature ("microscopic ridges," "chalk dust trails") creates rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from observational precision to intimate revelation without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold; "silent detonation of perception" edges toward density risk in high-pressure beat but redeemed by context, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heart transplant as perceptual shift device avoids medical tropes; "prisms" reframing transforms "magnetize stories" cliché into inevitable-yet-original emotional calculus.</comment>
