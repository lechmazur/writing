<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Mortimer's presence and the protagonist's shift from analytical detachment to embodied grief-release; the final renunciation of holding the globe earns closure with visible cost ("griefs felt lighter").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density builds to the snow globe's conceptual repricing; cost is legible in "release not an act of violence" with no causality breaks. Orientation anchors within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The snow globe (micro-setting) constrains choice via the manipulator arm struggle and charges the final image; waterlogged books vs. dry miniature library creates irreplaceable pressure for the physics metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the father's note forces a trade-off between scientific curiosity and acceptance; cost crystallizes in "placid safety" versus "perfect stasis" with irreversible emotional consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete physics metaphor ("conservation of momentum"), not moralizing; the final image reweights "letting go" as cosmic peace without stated moral, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers") modulates rhythm under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally when Mortimer "sharpen[s]" during the globe discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("lazy suspension," "gilded cage") propels momentum without muddle; final line recharges the snow globe motif with conceptual precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted object" trope through quantum physics lens; the fresh inflection—letting go as conservation, not loss—feels inevitable yet revelatory, resisting abstraction with specific scientific logic.</comment>
