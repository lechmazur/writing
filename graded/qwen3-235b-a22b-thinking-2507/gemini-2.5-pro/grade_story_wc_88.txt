<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in cavern climax—numbness vs fragile spark—but early "ghost he couldn't recognize" leans slightly stock. Final choice earned through bioluminescent epiphany with visible cost: grey numbness pierced by empathy’s "tiny, fragile spark."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "build a future he could" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Minor escalation slip in classifieds-to-coordinates leap slightly softens pressure, but cavern descent’s "each step a choice" tightens options meaningfully under causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake isn’t backdrop but constraint—it forces descent, supplies light for letter, and charges closure via "pulsing life" mirroring empathy’s fragility. Sensory specificity ("wet stone," "faded red stitching") filters through jaded POV without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindling empathy) tightens through protagonist’s agency: ignoring coordinates would maintain sterile peace, but descent forecloses that path. Cost is unmistakable—"grey numbness" pierced by "fragile spark"—though "desert of ash" metaphor slightly abstracts early stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: bioluminescent resilience reweights "kindling empathy" as fragile growth, not grand redemption. Final image—"he had found his kindle"—avoids moralizing while answering the central question through concrete particulars (letter/baseball/lake light).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in clinical-poetic duality ("court-mandated motivation," "universe of soft blue light"). Rhythm accelerates in descent ("narrowing to flashlight beam"), compressing stress without syntax collapse. Zero register drift despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "worn leather/faded stitching" does triple duty (character, setting, theme). Minor density dip in "jaded wonder" label, but compensated by later embodied prose ("breath catching," "spark pierced numbness"). Closure image razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia trope via concrete details (Cinderwood Barrens, Pelican case) and emotional specificity—empathy isn’t regained but "kindled" as fragile possibility. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through bioluminescent motif’s causal pressure on final choice.</comment>
