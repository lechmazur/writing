<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("serenade monotony") and embodied focus on micro-choices (carving channel, placing coin), but interior contradiction remains underdeveloped; no visible struggle between creativity and risk. Final choice lacks earned emotional cost beyond quiet satisfaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the illuminated mural crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (ephemeral beauty amid decay), while causal lens holds through Kael's precise interventions. Tide-driven escalation narrows options to a single decisive pressure point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arcade functions as active constraint—water's path and machine vibrations directly shape tactics. The bishop chess piece charges the final image (holding "phantom warmth of starlight"), making environment indispensable to closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imposing order on chaos) tightens via Kael's coin placement, with escalation driven by protagonist agency. Conceptual cost—beauty's fragility—is legible in the fading light and resumed tide, though physical stakes lack visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bishop's transformation from calculation tool to prism, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "monotony" into transcendent impermanence without stating a moral, satisfying the non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("loom weaving threads of probability") and rhythmic control under pressure ("silver tongue licking foundations"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure's crystalline imagery with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere or causality ("rhythmic hiss of the incoming tide" sets temporal pressure). Figurative language ("stubborn pulse of a dying star") enhances rather than obscures the peak beat's mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms street-performer trope through hyper-specific physics-poetry synthesis. Risk-taking (orchestrating chaos via grime channels) heightens stakes coherently, with the bishop's reprise feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
