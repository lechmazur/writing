<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's embodied contradiction (pragmatic actions vs. belief in "living wisdom") drives the victory choice; manager's thin but sufficient as pressure source. Final marble-cracking earns stakes through prior causality. Minor flaw: manager's dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably with conceptual cost (cracked marble = acceptance of necessary imperfection). Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative lens holds through butterfly arrival reconfiguring "perfection" metrics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze actively pressures choices (bees ignore automatons, butterflies choose Elias's section). Marbles function as micro-setting charging final image; wisteria/sundial details constrain tactics. Meets 9+ gate via environment shaping the victory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (solstice deadline); escalation via Elias's quiet preparation vs. metrics-driven opposition. Cost legible in marble ritual under Accumulative lens. Agency-driven deepening as garden's response validates his method, narrowing options to conceptual victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Mended deception" concept integrates through actions (hidden fungal treatment, cracked marbles), not stated moral. Final image reweights "perfection" with undeniable conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in manager's unresolved stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracks as beauty" noticing); rhythm modulates from meditative polishing to urgent butterfly arrival. Minor flaw: manager's "valiant effort" line slightly generic, though sufficient for single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "river of living jewels" crystallizes high-pressure beat without figurative muddle. Final line ("cracked sphere now a worthy monument") achieves high density with clear propulsion. Flawless cadence in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data vs. intuition through specific gardening logic. Transformation test passed: swapping names/places would break meaning. Bold risk in victory hinging on external butterflies while maintaining internal agency via method.</comment>
