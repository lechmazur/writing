<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("thunder in her chest," phantom scents), with embodied contradiction (seeking stone while fearing buried talents). Final choice to seed new reality earns closure through prior causality, though micro-choice during despair lacks nuance in shifting from inert stone to revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "home was not a place to be found but a foundation to be laid" crystallizes stance with visible cost (abandoning phantom worlds). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density escalation to the feather’s "whisper-light drag" breakthrough.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bookstore functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (endless corridors, dead-end canyons) and charges closure through "soil and deep roots" dream. Stone/feather transform from inert objects to tools that reconfigure Elara’s relationship with the mountain’s "breathing entity."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authentic belonging vs. phantom escapes) tightens through sensory escalation: nightly distractions grow "frantic" while stone’s initial "disappointment like physical weight" raises cost. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens—feather method’s rediscovery narrows options to tactile resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "lost language stone" reveals home as connection, not location. Final image of planting herbs reweights "thunder" motif into "scent of rain" without moralizing, offering resonant answer to "shape of home" through soil/dream imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured, reflective" visions, scent-based reality swaps) modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Lyric compression ("universe of paper and dust carved into the heart of a mountain") taught early pays off in closure’s tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Near-loop in para 1 ("fractured, reflective, and never showing the whole truth") slightly dilutes propulsion, but zero artifacts in closure beat. High density achieved through concrete verbs ("shelving," "trembled," "seed") though minor scaffolding in "kinder than her own history" weakens momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "search for home" trope via specific sensory mechanics (feather’s texture as key). Emotional truth anchors universals in verifiable detail: stone’s "cool and silent" disappointment, owls’ "soft sounds." Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
