<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vale's ancient resentment lacks concrete embodiment beyond energy flickers, weakening internal conflict; Elara's pacifist scheming shines via cellular memory micro-choices but Vale's abrupt shift to acceptance lacks sufficient causal struggle before the harmonic hum resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (harmonic hum stabilizing reality) lands with undeniable cost in Elara's dissolution, but the "critical point" phrasing ("patient had to choose cure or perish") slightly tells rather than shows escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The music box cylinder pin constrains every choice—its broken state defines the grievance, guides memory selection, and charges the final hum—while the sanctuary's enforced silence directly enables the cellular memory method, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via intensifying reality shifts (grinding dimensions, brutal contortions) tightens pressure under Accumulative lens, but Vale's resistance lacks visible price beyond environmental chaos until closure, slightly muting mid-beat cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Broken song is not the end of music" crystallizes shifting grace without moralizing, reweighting the cylinder pin's meaning through the harmonic hum; thematic resonance emerges purely from sensory particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phantom pressure of a hand held in trust") filters all description through Elara's cellular memory lens, though "the nature of shifting grace" briefly drifts into academic register during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but passive phrasing ("the choice was made") in the closure beat slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise, "grinding dimensions" and "rhythmic flux" exemplify textural propulsion with precise sonic specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic conflict via sound physics (grievance as broken music box pin) feels inevitable; risk-taking with silence-as-setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, though reality shifts verge on generic chaos.</comment>
