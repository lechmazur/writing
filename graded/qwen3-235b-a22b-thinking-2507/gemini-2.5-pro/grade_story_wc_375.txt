<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past impatience vs. present finesse) manifest in lock manipulation micro-choices; "primal need" phrasing slightly oversteps embodied emotion but tear through charcoal dust grounds closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via tear catching light ("falling star" image), fulfilling causal lens with legible cost; Anya's off-page presence risks orientation debt but painting's diagrammatic reimagining anchors causality by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cave crystals constrain choice (light sequence as lock key) and charge final image (phosphorescent pigments, tear as falling star); sensory specificity ("crystalline hum," "gritty charcoal dust") filters through artist's perceptual bias without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: reinterpretation of painting shifts tactics from force to finesse, narrowing options via light-sequence manipulation; "auroral sorrow" crystallizes stakes with tear's visible cost under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final line ("paint not what he saw, but the light by which he saw it") offers non-literal thematic answer through charged image, avoiding moralizing; suppressed creativity vs. replication conflict resolves via pigment discovery without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Artist's perceptual signature ("azure, rose, gold, violet" cadence) modulates under pressure with sentence fragmentation during lock sequence; zero POV slippage despite reflective fragments anchored by iron box and painting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "crystalline hum" to "falling star" progression achieves high density without figurative muddle; rhythm accelerates during lock manipulation ("Azure. Rose. Gold. Violet.") then breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic gift as creative prison transforms artist-block trope; crystal pigments as future-tools (not masterpiece) risks sentimentality but earns emotional truth through tactile specificity ("brushes drink ambient light").</comment>
