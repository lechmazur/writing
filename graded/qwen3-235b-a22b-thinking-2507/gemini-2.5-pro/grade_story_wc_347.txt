<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "weary resignation" versus "stubborn spark," embodied in furrowed brow during assembly. Final choice to disassemble with "weary nonchalance" earns endurance with hollow nut as visceral cost. No therapy-speak; flaws (cynicism vs. duty) drive action without resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: cracked nut and arriving frost crystallize cost of saving one life. Causal chain (horn→assembly→activation→rescue) is airtight with frost deadline tightening options. "Guardian bound to cursed orchard" reconfigures meaning with undeniable emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (beacon components) constrains every choice: spent nut charges final image, frost deadline forces urgency. Granite labyrinth actively pressures action—ice-glazed paths and aggressive birds alter tactics. "Filigree of impending doom" crystallizes environment’s lethal beauty without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (save traveler before frost) escalates via "first delicate crystals blooming" during assembly, narrowing Elias’ window. Agency is pure protagonist-driven willwork under time pressure. Cost is undeniable: hollow nut, deepening frost, and weary disassembly foreclose hope of escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "graceless beauty" of assembly and "sliver of meaning" in saving lives. Final image rejects tidy morals—cursed orchard endures, yet one life matters. Avoids false equivalence; birds’ mercilessness contrasts Elias’ quiet compassion without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "granite walls rearranged with tidal pull," "stubborn spark in cynical pit." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during assembly ("He knelt... He didn't touch"). No head-hopping; psychic distance stays anchored in Elias’ tactile focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cog trembled and slid" shows propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("filigree of impending doom"). Final line’s "sliver of meaning" charges closure without overwriting. Minor deduction: "merciless obsidian eyes" borders on cliché but doesn’t dull climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed guardian" trope via will-based assembly and nut-as-power-source mechanics. Emotional truth in weary heroism ("graceless beauty" of clumsy action achieving perfection). Bold risk: quiet Earned Stasis ending where curse persists but meaning flickers.</comment>
