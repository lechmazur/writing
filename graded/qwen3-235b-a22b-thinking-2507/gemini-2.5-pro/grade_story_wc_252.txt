<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cage" vs "home") and embodied emotion ("thudding boots") anchor choices, but Elara’s rapid shift from combativeness to acceptance lacks micro-choice progression at climax, slightly undercutting earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the island’s rise crystallizes stakes with felt cost (Elara’s "aching acceptance"), but the scrimshaw’s "impossible quality" handwaves mechanics, risking causality fragility under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Docks’ splintered wood and whalebone scrimshaw constrain choices (Kaelen’s flow vs others’ strain), charging the final image; "sublittoral fringe" specificity elevates setting beyond backdrop into active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s silent call escalating to physical island ascent, but Elara’s passive witnessing dilutes agency—pressure coheres via Accumulative lens yet lacks secondary character’s active trade-off despite visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image of drifting island reweights "cage" metaphor without moralizing, but "freedom in embracing true nature" risks thematic echo; earned resonance through tactile particulars (mossy stone, primeval blossoms) avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fluid economy of motion," "dull ache of routine") modulates with tension, yet dialogue convergence in climax ("This is madness"/"My nature isn’t here") slightly flattens voice contrast under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in sensory beats ("waterfalls of brine," "scent of wet earth") propels momentum, but "soul-shaking thrum" and "primeval blossoms" verge on stock phrasing, dulling closure’s visceral impact by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dockworker protagonist and lyrical magic realism elevates trope, yet "unlocks guarded hearts" label and familiar island myth limit risk; specificity of scrimshaw’s grooves grounds originality without gimmickry.</comment>
