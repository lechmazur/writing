<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kenji’s embodied grief avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (seeking apologies vs. accepting diffusion) drive his lace-deciphering micro-choices. Flaws (rigid guilt) complicate agency, but backstory stays anchored to lace without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: guilt’s diffusion into "vast, melancholic blue" reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("crystalline shard began to soften"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The islet’s wind/tide timing actively constrains Kenji’s actions ("wind turning to push against incoming tide" triggers climax). Recurring compass charges closure, though "cerulean regret" borders on overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kenji’s agency: lace decoding and tide-waiting narrow options to a single pressure point. Cost is unmistakable—"bitter words... began to diffuse"—but escalation lacks a second intensifying beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace/compass motifs without moralizing; ending reweights "unspoken apologies" as a "soft, forgiving glow" that charges prior material. Avoids sentimentality by embracing grief’s diffusion, not erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: bonsai focus shapes noticing ("errant needle," "spiral knot"). Rhythm modulates with stress, though "concentrated agony" drifts slightly from Kenji’s lexicon during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("diffuse" repeated 3x near closure) dull momentum, but prose remains lyrical and propulsive. Final line ("silence that grew between them") charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through bonsai/compass specifics; lace-as-map feels organic, not gimmicky. Emotional truth in "diffusing" guilt avoids middle-ground risk, though tide metaphor leans familiar.</comment>
