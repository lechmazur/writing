<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "clumsy, grieving hands" vs current precision; embodied "snowmelt ardor" avoids labels. But dissolution of sigil lacks micro-choice showing internal conflict—pure fulfillment misses chance for layered grief under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dissolving sigil crystallizes cost of light over sound) works under Accumulative lens. Auroral timing creates pressure, but "he hadn’t brought back the sound" tells rather than viscerally shows the cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice dome constrains choices (light projection surface); aurora as timepiece and glacial tools charge closure. Micro-setting triumph: sigil’s dissolution into ice directly reweights wax-casting heritage with palpable loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as texture intensifies (holes→weave→light→sigil), but dominant conflict (sound preservation) lacks concrete on-page test—no moment where success/failure hangs in balance despite technical precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ghost of a ghost" metaphor and sigil’s dissolution—preservation as transmutation, not restoration. Final wax sketch answers central question without moralizing, though "forgiveness" backdrop slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") modulates under pressure; rhythm mirrors weaving process. Zero POV drift, with lyrical compression taught early (aurora as clock) and paid off in closure’s light decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless except "snowmelt ardor" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat; "pearlescent radiance" risks overwriting but saved by concrete "cast no shadows." Zero loops, maximal density in sigil’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "memory preservation" trope through specific physics (light=impermanence, wax=solidity). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—dissolving sigil feels inevitable, not gimmicky, charging the final wax sketch with conceptual weight.</comment>
