<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "carefully reckless precision" and blood sacrifice, with embodied emotion ("frantic beating heart" vs steady hand). Final choice—silence for symphony—forecloses verbal apology path with visible cost. Slightly thin Elara's reaction lacks micro-choice depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Elara’s hand reach crystallizes options with felt cost (blood, vulnerability). Causal lens holds throughout ritual execution. Minor deduction for moon-quartz vial feeling convenient rather than earned constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archive’s moonlight beam and dust motes establish atmosphere, but setting lacks pressure on choices. Glass ink well functions as micro-setting—its emptiness charges the final image. Falls short of 9+ gate as environment doesn’t constrain tactics beyond providing materials.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via "thousand unspoken fears" and blood sacrifice, with escalation driven by Kaelen’s glyph-writing agency. Cost is unmistakable in his vulnerability and Elara’s guarded pain. Narrowing of options lacks one tightening beat—moon-quartz feels slightly convenient rather than organic escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual’s physicality, not abstraction; final hand-reach offers non-literal answer to "can silence be undone?" Avoids moralizing, though "bone-deep agony" edges toward label-speak. Resonance stems from concrete particulars (shattered vial, empty ink well).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct scholarly voice ("grammatical vows," "syntactical pledges") modulates under stress with rhythmic control. Perceptual signature shines in linguistic precision. "Cautious exuberance" phrasing slightly detaches from embodied urgency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dust motes danced like constellations" exemplifies textural specificity. Propulsion never falters, though "bone-deep agony" risks cliché. Final line’s "fragile, resonant chord" avoids sentimentality through musical motif integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "grand gesture" trope via linguistic specificity—truth-symphonies as relationship repair. Glass ink well reprise (transparent promise fulfilled) is non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth avoids generic templates through scholar’s meticulous recklessness.</comment>
