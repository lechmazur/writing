<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cages for a wild thing" vs. "membranes") crystallizes in the ice discovery. Final renunciation to "witness communion" forecloses correction with visceral cost: "breath a cloud" as his worldview shatters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "his job was not to correct this beautiful flaw" reconfigures the entire premise. Accumulative lens holds—the ice shard deepens pressure through sensory density, not plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacial melt water isn't backdrop but active constraint: its "memory of immense pressure" causes the ice shard. Final image ("shoreline where geologic time met measurement") charges the setting with irreversible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One tightening suffices: the ice shard discovery reframes Elias' mission from correction to witnessing. Cost is legible in "tectonic flaw in the fabric of his world"—his life's work becomes communion, not control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the obsidian edge: clocks "drink the horizon," not measure time. Final line reweights everything without moralizing—"patient, crushing memory of itself" avoids abstraction through glacial specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: an engineer sees "spider’s thread" discrepancies. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Three... two... one..."); the fjord’s quiet becomes embodied in his cleared mind. Zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. "Water sighing through copper pipes" achieves textural propulsion. Minor deduction for "tectonic flaw in the fabric" (slight overwriting), but peak beats ("pulsed with faint internal light") maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes hydrology and glaciology to transform clock tropes: "razor edges as shoreline" feels inevitable. Risks lyric density but earns it through causal pressure—the ice shard must lodge there for the revelation.</comment>
