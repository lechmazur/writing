<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("silence was the true state" vs "thistle-blown hope") drives the climax choice, but "the silence was not an end, but a pause" edges toward thematic labeling without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly; closure as Decisive Change with undeniable cost ("fragile heartbeat against infinite dark") crystallizes the earned fragility of connection after Elian's near-relapse into despair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as active micro-setting—constraining star-tracking and charging the final beam—while the shard's "suffocating void" physically shapes Elian's climactic hesitation and resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the shard's memories threaten his resolve; the cost—success as fragile vulnerability ("not the blazing pillar... but a start")—reconfigures victory under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: the "fragile heartbeat" beam reweights "silence" without moralizing, transforming "coincidences have meaning" into tangible, resonant hope via the star-lane prism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bruised twilight," "ghosts of towns") remains character-bound; rhythm shifts organically from lyrical to staccato during the shard placement, mirroring Elian's stress without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "retrocognitively blessed" briefly drifts into clinical diction during high pressure, slightly dulling immediacy in a pivotal reflection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific, grounded choices (shard of hush, thistle-seed hope); risk-taking in fragile resolution deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
