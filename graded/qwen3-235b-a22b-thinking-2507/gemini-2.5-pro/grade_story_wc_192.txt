<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's "difficult mercy" motivation is embodied through precise fire/cauterization metaphors and scar-linking method; Liam's stiff-lunged breath shows earned contradiction without therapy-speak. Only slight overpolish in "tender shadow keeper" label risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "lungs stiff from disuse" reconfigures isolation's purpose. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory density buildup; orientation anchors within 40 words via "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: ash grit dictates kneeling posture, scar becomes conduit tool. Final image charges ring's warmth against "undisturbed ashes" – environment directly reweights stakes through tactile specificity ("gritty ash crunching").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: pressing iron to scar narrows options from "fading threshold" to "conduit". Cost is visceral in Liam's "stiff from disuse" lungs – a felt price that alters tactics (breathing as active relearning).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: oak tree memory reweights "teach suffocating to breathe" without moralizing. Final image ("He had remembered how to breathe") offers non-literal answer to central question via charged action, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused diction ("skeletal remains of rafters", "phantom chill traced the scar"). Rhythm modulates perfectly – short sentences for tension ("She closed her eyes"), lyrical flow for reflection – with no head-hopping across shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vast, clean emptiness of a lung filling with night air" does triple duty (sensory, thematic, propulsion). Final line crystallizes closure without a single weak modifier or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "burning bridges" trope through precise fire metaphor ("cauterize rather than festering char") and scar-linking method. Emotional specificity in "dizzy and bleeding and laughing" children creates fresh inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
