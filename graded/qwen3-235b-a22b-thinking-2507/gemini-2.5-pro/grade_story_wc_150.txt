<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (methodical wandering vs. urgency to touch lineage source) but lacks visible micro-choice cost during excavation; "hollowness" motif avoids abstraction yet final acceptance lacks friction with prior skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (hollow space filling with questions, not answers); Accumulative lens holds through sensory pattern-building; sunlight on sundial crystallizes reconfiguration where ship carving reframes "interrupted" as "perpetual departure."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard roots constrain choice (freeing sundial from fig grip) and charge final image (bones/roots as "stubborn continuity"); micro-setting detail (clavicle, limestone grain) filters through Elara’s tactile urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency (wandering method → sundial discovery) but cost remains internalized; "perpetual departure" realization reweights dominant stake (faith restoration) without tangible forfeiture beyond initial hollowness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ship carving’s reversal (sails toward sun = hopeful departure); avoids moralizing via concrete image reweighting "interrupted journeys" into resilience, though "faith in quiet spirit" borders on abstraction without deeper counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silver vein slithering," "damp soil and faint blossoms" blending decay/life); rhythmic control shifts from meditative wandering to urgent excavation; no POV leakage despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "bleached-white clavicle" and "cautious enchantment" achieve textural specificity without overwriting; minor density dip in reflection ("profound hollowness") avoided full 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through catacomb orchard’s visceral specificity; "perpetual departure" reframing feels earned via sundial’s physical reinstallation; avoids sentimentality but risks over-neatness in closure’s peaceful resolution.</comment>
