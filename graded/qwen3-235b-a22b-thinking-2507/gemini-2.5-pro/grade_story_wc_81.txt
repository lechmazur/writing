<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' "tranquilly perceptive" trait manifests concretely in his dissatisfaction with the "water damage" explanation and his physical verification process. Contradictory impulses (duty to official history vs truth-seeking) crystallize in his quiet resolve to re-index, with the stamp's rough texture embodying the felt cost of his choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: the coral stamp's revelation reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("the founders... stole it"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure tightens via sensory accumulation (biolamps, moss glow) rather than causality, with the blackout enabling the truth's emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The phosphorescent moss functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Elias must readjust posture to use its glow), directly enabling the verification beat. Final image of "clutching the coral stamp" charges closure through tactile specificity, though the library's broader details don't actively alter tactics beyond this key moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs sanitized history) tightens through knowledge deepening when the stamp matches the mark, foreclosing Elias' prior assumptions. Conceptual cost ("ugly truth... clarifying calm") is unmistakable, but lacks a visible price altering tactics—his resolve shifts stance without practical consequence, capping escalation per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" evolves from physical quiet to ethical stance through action, avoiding moralizing. Final image of solitary re-indexing offers resonant non-literal answer to "honest origins," reweighting the premise via the coral stamp's charged recurrence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elias' selective noticing ("faint discoloration... too organic in its faint symmetry"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (short phrases during stamp verification). Voice remains consistent—no register drift even at peak tension when he realizes the theft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "saline-treated paper and pressed kelp-vellum" exemplifies high-density worldbuilding. Final line ("silent partner in his meticulous, solitary reclamation") crystallizes theme through concrete action without abstraction. Minor deduction for one near-duplicate ("faint, flickering biolamps"/"ghostly, passive luminescence").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "historian discovers truth" trope through sunken-city specifics—the coral stamp's cultural erasure feels earned, not quirky. Emotional truth in Elias' calm reaction avoids cliché, but "reclaimed stillness" as concept slightly edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in prior beats.</comment>
