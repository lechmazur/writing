<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in holding joy/sorrow simultaneously, but Kael's acceptance lacks deeper struggle against his role; the "quiet house of his mind" phrasing slightly abstracts embodiment at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("residue in his own soul") under Accumulative lens; amber grotto's transformation from preserver to emotional crucible creates undeniable pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto's evolving luminescence directly constrains Kael's actions and charges the final image; "dust and ozone" sensory specificity filters through his chemist's perception while shaping the extraction process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kael's agency as he separates charges, with the cost ("cold, dense stone" in chest) visibly altering his final action; one tightening suffices but the sorrow's weight could narrow options more acutely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the petal's duality, but "beautiful lie" in the final line edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining the earned ambiguity of the flower/roots metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless ("tasting of dust and ozone," "fizzing, electric noise"); rhythm modulates perfectly from crystalline stillness to sensory overload during extraction without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "quiet, obsessive need to fuse insight with empathy" risks abstract telling but is redeemed by immediate embodied action; every line advances texture or pressure with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory alchemy and emotional labor avoids tropes; the static electricity method transforms clichéd "first love" into tangible physics, though the core premise slightly echoes existing emotion-trading concepts.</comment>
