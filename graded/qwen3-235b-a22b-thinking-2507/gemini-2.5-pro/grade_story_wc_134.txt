<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyra’s contradictory impulses (guardian vs. facilitator) act simultaneously through embodied choices like lowering her hand; Kael’s underdevelopment slightly limits relationship crucible but single-POV focus justifies it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with explicit cost ("clarity gone, replaced by simple sight"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through shadow-image escalation to the shadow-merger revelation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cave actively constrains choices (scrying fails, path guided by light) and charges the final image ("new, sweeter song"); micro-setting of shadows directly enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the cave’s "steadily unpredictable" behavior forcing Lyra’s scrying failure and shadow-driven realization; cost (lost clairvoyance) visibly alters her final state under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("shimmer on water," "whispers in wind") reweighted by the final image; no moralizing, only earned resonance in "simple, profound sight" answering the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("thousand futures splinter," "discordant note shivering"); rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to urgent without head-hopping; shadow imagery teaches its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "murky, a swirl of dancing shadows" compresses setting/emotion/foreshadowing; only microscopic abstraction in "bright darkness" avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific cave mechanics (shadows as communication); emotional truth in obsolescence feels fresh; risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
