<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (realist accepting extinction vs. ritual builder) manifest in concrete micro-choices like tying knots as "punctuation marks." Final renunciation earned through embodied action, though minor abstraction in "duty done" slightly dilutes cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "transiently rooted, like the butterflies, like him" crystallizes the conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density of ritual details tightens into the butterfly passage without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mica-preserved moth wing functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (translating "ancient schematic") and charges the final image as "only proof." Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters details through Elias’s esoteric realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the "sparse, hesitant trickle" of butterflies arrives, forcing Elias into accelerated action ("hands a blur"). Cost is visceral in the "fragile chain linking his signals"—agency lies in honoring loss, not preventing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "ghost milkweeds" and knots as "punctuation marks" avoid moralizing. Final image ("built a soft place for it to land") reweights extinction with resonant ambiguity, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "blushing stillness" filtered through an esoteric realist’s lens. Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical ("cradle of impossible green") to urgent ("hands a blur") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances texture or pressure. "Faltered cadence made visible" exemplifies high-density prose. Final line recharges "quiet cadence" with crystalline precision—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms extinction trope through specific ritual (signals for earth’s memory). Fresh synthesis: "transiently rooted" grotto and moth-wing data make loss palpable. Emotional truth avoids generic despair.</comment>
