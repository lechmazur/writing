<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("hollow ache," stiff legs) but limited contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice earned though micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs beyond the core realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: star-stamp pulsing with heartbeat crystallizes courage-as-choice with visceral cost ("hollow ache," severed leash). Accumulative lens held rigorously through sensory progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and sea-kelp ticket function as essential micro-settings—mist navigation shapes tactics, star-stamp charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (jasmine scent, moonlight) reflects urgency without checklist overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the single escalation of ticket stamping, foreclosing passive searching ("not an object to be found"). Cost legible in "severed leash" and "country of ghosts," though protagonist agency initiates only the final step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the star-stamp's transformation; final image ("shadow long and steady") resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action ("muscle to be flexed").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("purple ink bleeding," "sea-worn stones") with rhythmic control under pressure; sentence cadence mirrors emotional shifts. Zero head-hopping or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "captured firefly" light and "shoreline lullaby" demonstrate high density without muddle. Final line recharges opening motif with precise propulsion. One near-duplicate ("ageless and serene"/"deep harbor calm") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ferryman trope through kelp ticket and star-stamp specificity; emotional truth in courage-as-muscle avoids cliché. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though ridgeway setting leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
