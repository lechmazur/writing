<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "preemptive nostalgia" embodied in stormlit hush already mourned. Micro-choices (shadow measurements, quill grasp) earn final renunciation of archival mission with visceral cost: "sculpting a new identity from their courageous act." Label-like "peculiar sorrow" slightly mars otherwise concrete emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: fog redefined from prison to monument via storm-triggered memory. Cost is undeniable in "purpose was not merely to archive what was, but to understand the reasons for what wasn't." Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; lightning-shadow alignment tightens pressure decisively without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Observatory constrains choices: lightning flashes enable shadow calibration, rain activates crystals. Final "hush... of profound understanding" recharges opening storm imagery. Environment charges closure through tangible cause-effect—crystals dim only after Kael's realization, proving setting's causal role in thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (understanding fog's nature) escalates through Kael's agency: frantic shadow measurements narrow to Lyra's glyph alignment. Cost is legible in repurposed mission—"record the memory of their choice"—with visible tactical shift from archiving to honoring absence. Pressure intensifies via storm's rhythm without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sculpting identity from absence" crystallizes via crystal forecourt and quill. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—"monument to an impossible choice" avoids sentimentality. No thematic echo; wisdom arises from Kael's embodied realization rather than abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "lightning spiderwebbed," "ozone-rich air" filter through archivist's precision. Rhythm modulates under stress—shorter sentences during shadow measurements. Single POV maintained; "resonant parchments" slightly abstract but compensated by consistent voice. Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or causality. "Scar tissue formed over communal wound" serves concept without muddling. Final line achieves crystalline clarity: "hush... profound understanding" recharges opening storm with emotional precision. No figurative muddle even in peak memory-revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia tropes: fog as deliberate memory-scarving feels inevitable through shadow-calibration method. Emotional specificity in "sculpting identity from absence" avoids templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—solid 9+ quick test fulfillment.</comment>
