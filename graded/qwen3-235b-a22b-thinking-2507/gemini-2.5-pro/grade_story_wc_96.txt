<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in persona shift: Reckoner’s despair vs. Architect’s hope drives concrete choices (cataloging failures vs. seeing potential). Micro-choice to welcome drifters earns closure through embodied cost—"trembling finger" and "haunted eyes" crystallize stakes without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: drifters’ arrival reconfigures solitary rebuilding into communal hope, with cost legible in the young woman’s "haunted eyes" and Silas’s vulnerable offering of the poem. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (crunching glass, moonlight) until intrusion crystallizes new stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library skeleton constrains choices: rusted girders and water-warped spines force meticulous sorting, charging the final image of four people amid ruins. Micro-setting (coffee tin’s false bottom) directly enables poem distribution, reweighting "blooming resistance" through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when drifters arrive—their intrusion forces Silas to risk trust, foreclosing solitude. Cost is visceral in the young woman’s trembling but slightly underweighted; her haunted state implies prior trauma but isn’t explicitly tied to the library’s rebirth stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "luminous fracture" of the poem against darkness, reweighted in the final moonlit sorting. Avoids moralizing; "to rebuild is to believe the stars see more than just our scars" resonates as earned wisdom from concrete struggle, not abstract thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Silas notices "water-warped spines" and "rusted girders," reflecting Architect’s salvager lens. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences when drifters appear ("Silas’s breath caught")—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sliver of bone" moon metaphor extends organically to "luminous fracture" of the poem. Final line’s "impossible, beautiful work" distills tension without cliché. Minor deduction: "cathedral of decay" edges toward familiar phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "blooming resistance" via book-rebuilding subverts dystopian tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—quiet pressure of sorting books replaces violent rebellion, yet feels urgent. Missing one bold inflection to reach 9.0+ (e.g., deeper exploration of persona-molt cost).</comment>
