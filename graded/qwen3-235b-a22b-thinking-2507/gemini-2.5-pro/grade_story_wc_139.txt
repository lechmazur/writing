<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-choices like unscrewing the dragon's head reveal contradictory impulses (honesty vs necessary deceit), but "constant, quiet atonement" borders on clinical label-speak. Final choice deeply earned through prep room pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cycloid curve reweights "fair trade" with mathematical certainty. Cost is legible in "heavier than before" silence and moral compromise. Causal lens holds flawlessly from father's backstory to solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ink pot constrains choices (signing with ghost ink) and charges closure via the cycloid diagram. Prep room's chemical packs and sterility directly enable Silus's transformation, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is pure agency: Silus's arrival tightens options, "seventy-two hours" deadline creates invisible pressure. Cost is conceptual (moral compromise) but unmistakable in "most dishonest thing... most profoundly fair" juxtaposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through the cycloid curve—no stated moral. It transforms "mathematics of fair trade" from emotional quest to proven solution, reweighting prior material with mathematical elegance and lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("porcelain stillness," "chemical tang") persists under stress. Syntax compresses during high-pressure beats ("He looked like a man suspended..."). "Liquefies rigid thinking" slightly drifts into abstraction but pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ozonic scent of 'The Ghost'" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "liquefies rigid thinking" abstraction in peak beat, but no figurative muddle. Final line recharges "mathematics" motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms asylum trope through math-as-redemption lens. Cycloid curve isn't gimmick—it emerges organically from established motivation. Emotional truth in "fair trade" calculus avoids generic templates while feeling inevitable.</comment>
