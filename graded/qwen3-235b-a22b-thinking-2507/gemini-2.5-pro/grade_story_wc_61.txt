<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Xylar's ancestral sorrow versus generational hope, embodied through "vessel for feelings too vast for a heart" and the gear's release. Final choice to broadcast light earns cost via tangible forfeiture of the machine relic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the search... was the light" reconfigures meaning with felt cost in the gear's tumble. Accumulative lens holds as emotional density shifts from mapping to broadcasting, narrowing options through pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden functions as micro-setting: hydrogen veils constrain navigation via sonar pinging, while "falling petals" timeframe charges the final bloom. Sensory specificity ("sharp with purpose" on gear teeth) avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Xylar's method shift—from mapping sorrow to broadcasting light—narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible in releasing the gear, though "approximates infinity" lacks on-page constraint affecting tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "light was an emission" reweights the central question without moralizing. Final broadcast reframes renewal as shared feeling, avoiding binaries while charging the nebula's transformation from "troubling serenity" to true bloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in "empathy sonar" metaphors and cosmic lexicon. Voice modulates under pressure—longer sentences during reflection, clipped rhythm at nullity discovery—without register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quiet sigh of falling petals" motif weaves efficiently through opening and climax. High density in "light consumed nothing, a warmth that cost no one their past" avoids purple prose while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic husbandry and emotional transmission avoids genre tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, with nebula's "serene silence" transformed through specific, earned reconfiguration rather than abstraction.</comment>
