<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stoic surveyor vs. "currents of feeling") act simultaneously during inkwell dive; final endurance of purpose earned by visceral retrieval cost (raw knuckles, near-drowning). No stock phrasing; "hushed blaze in his eyes" embodies earned tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens: rising tide crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. Inkwell loss/recovery tightens focus to single decisive intensification; cost legible in "knuckles scraped raw" and altered sealing ritual. Orientation clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (inkwell’s brass weight) constrains dive tactics and charges final image ("gleaming like a dark star"). Sensory hierarchy flawless: surveyor notices fissures before ghosts, silt-stirred blackness narrows perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (preserving memory against time) tightened through protagonist’s agency: inkwell retrieval forecloses path of loss. Cost (physical injury, emotional risk) visibly alters sealing ritual’s "fierce tenderness," reweighting options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (sealing vellum), not statement. Final image reweights "interlaced absence" as purpose: "sole guardian of the pavilion’s secret heart" avoids moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost of solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: surveyor notices "datum points" before emotions, "brackish water" before beauty. Rhythm modulates perfectly—long cadences for reflection, staccato during dive. No POV leakage; lexicon stays within professional bounds ("transit levels," "brackish").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silt-stirred blackness" and "hushed blaze" do triple duty. Final line’s "rising tide" recharges opening marsh mist with closure weight. No figurative muddle—every image serves pressure, especially inkwell as "dark star" crystallizing purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor’s secret archaeology transforms memory trope through mortar-sealed vellum. Emotional specificity in "He said we would watch the heron’s flight" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
