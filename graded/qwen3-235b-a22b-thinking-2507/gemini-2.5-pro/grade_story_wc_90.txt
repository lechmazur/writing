<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism and compassion manifest through embodied choices (welcoming grief, stitching knots), not labels; her final acceptance of her own sorrow with contradictory impulses—crushing desolation versus sacred trust—earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the aperture parts through acceptance, not force, with Elara’s dissolution into "airy vessel of peace" crystallizing cost; Accumulative lens holds as emotional density escalates via photo sequence toward the childhood image climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship actively pressures choices—groaning metal mirrors Elara’s weight shifts, deck plates buckle under grief—while Kwan Yin’s Tear and needle constrain tactics; micro-setting (faded photos, silver knots) charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Accumulative escalation: each photo’s sorrow narrows options toward the childhood image, where her own desolation threatens annihilation; cost is visceral in the ship’s shuddering and her bodily dissolution, though early dimension stakes could tighten faster.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—stitching knots to "integrate" pain—not moralizing; the final image reweights despair as sacred trust via Elara’s weightless drift, offering non-literal resolution to "collective human despair" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (gravitational metaphors for emotion, "needle thin as a whisper") modulates under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure, though "ghostly resolve" slightly verges on abstraction mid-beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with rhythmic control ("stitched and floated, stitched and sank"), but "crystallized compassion" edges toward convenient abstraction; zero loops, though "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" risks thematic echo if overinterpreted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism as dimensional key via grief-integration feels inevitable; gravitational emotion trait transforms sci-fi tropes into embodied stakes, while bold structural risk (Accumulative pressure over causal turns) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
