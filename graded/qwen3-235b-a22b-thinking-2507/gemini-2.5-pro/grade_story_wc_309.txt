<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("poet forced to write legal code") drives the pivotal micro-choice of unstrapping the pack; embodied inadequacy ("knot in stomach") avoids therapy-speak while showing flawed struggle against automated creativity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (rejecting worldview) under Accumulative/Textural lens; "brilliant dimness" reweights premise when Kael’s bare-hand touch awakens resonance, making the "felt cost" of his prior inadequacy undeniable in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound spire’s "brilliant dimness" constrains Kael’s tactics (diagnostics fail in thin air) and charges the closure; the keystone’s weightless glow—recurring as micro-setting—directly shapes the final choice to touch it bare-handed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via diagnostic failures narrows options under Accumulative lens; the felt cost of Kael’s "sacred in the simple" motivation crystallizes when the pack’s useless complexity thuds into snow, altering his final stance with visible emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the keystone’s "lingering luminance" reweighted at closure: the non-literal answer—"create something beautiful, for no reason at all"—avoids moralizing while reconfiguring magic’s value through Kael’s earned confidence, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "skeletal remains of a forgotten wizard’s garden" filtered through Kael’s poetic lens; rhythmic control under pressure peaks when short clauses ("The crystals flickered and died") mirror diagnostic frustration before lyrical resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised plum" sky and "muffled thud" exemplify textural specificity with propulsion, though "quiet refutation of everything" slightly overwrites a pivotal moment without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "underachiever" trope via Kael’s specific poetic misalignment; the fresh inflection—confidence as "most powerful magic" in automated world—grows inevitably from prior details like mist walking’s "imprecise, instinctual" nature.</comment>
