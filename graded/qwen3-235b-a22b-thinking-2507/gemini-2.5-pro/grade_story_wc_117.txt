<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied grief (white knuckles, hitched breathing) but lacks deeper contradictory impulses; Elias's "lifelong wonder" motivation edges toward therapy-speak without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with Lena's tender grip reconfiguring loss; cost is legible in her shift from desperate clutch to protective hold during the eclipse's visual climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sage Ridge's earth directly constrains choice when Lena places the curl on soil, charging the final image; eclipse light reshapes sensory perception throughout with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through eclipse progression into a single, earned deepening where Lena's choice to "link" reweights grief; cost is visible in her physical transformation from brittle posture to fragile smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("link them") rather than moralizing; final image of the curl as "proof of what she'd had" resonantly answers the central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's sensory language ("slow crawl of afternoon shadows"); rhythmic control intensifies during eclipse with purposeful compression ("world held its breath").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "cautious exuberance" repetition creates a minor paraphrase loop; no closure-impacting artifacts despite elevated diction in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief narrative through eclipse framework and "ordinary magic" ritual; fresh inflection in binding loss to love avoids sentimentality while feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
