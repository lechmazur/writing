<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s "nervously confident" micro-choices (thumbing the nail, breath hitching at the stanza) and embodied dread. Final renunciation of historical lies is earned through causal stakes, avoiding therapy-speak despite high pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably: "holding his great-great-grandmother's true log" charges the cost of questioning a century of lies. Causal lens holds from journal discovery to drone deployment, with the nail insertion tightening options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "spongey dread" atmosphere constrains Elias’s actions (e.g., "breathing entity in swirling fog" during the shore expedition) and charges the final image where the air "feels like it was beginning to dry," transforming setting into thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Elias’s agency under the Causal lens: decoding stanzas narrows options to the cove expedition, with the nail insertion creating irreversible stakes. Cost is legible in the physical and historical weight of the true log.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the copper nail’s evolution from memento to key—avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights "spongey dread" into purpose, offering a resonant answer to buried truth without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bucket of grey water," "sky-river's child") reflects Elias’s cartographic lens. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the shore sequence ("breath hitched," "trembling hand"), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("maddeningly mundane until script dissolved into verse") advances plot and character simultaneously. Closure beat ("air... beginning to dry") crystallizes theme without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking, climate collapse, and familial legacy transforms tropes. The "reversible exile" concept, grounded in specific stakes (micro-vortex, pitch-sealed leather), feels inevitable in hindsight with bold thematic risk.</comment>
