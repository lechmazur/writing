<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shedding layers" sequence; embodied anger-to-lightness progression avoids therapy-speak. Slight cliché in "brittle shell of pride" costs 0.2 under diagnostic-label anti-pattern.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (thinning mist/stars reconfiguring hope) with felt cost in prior emotional state. Two distinct non-closure flaws: backstory exceeds 20% word count, "shedding layers" metaphor lacks concrete staging—triggering -1.5 accumulation cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Misty workshop functions as micro-setting: fog's muting effect pressures Elias's focus, while thinning mist charges the final image. Velvet cloth/silicone tail constrains the pivotal fitting choice—clear 9+ gate fulfillment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's self-reconstruction method narrowing options (abandon compassion vs. lose self). Cost is legible in "shattered convictions" versus "resilient version of himself," but "shedding layers" abstraction slightly obscures agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tail-prosthetic motif: "fragile trust" reweights "vulnerability" without moralizing. Final image avoids thematic echo despite "compassion wasn't a vulnerability" phrasing—resonance saved by concrete star imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "hands built for strength but moved with grace of falling leaves" establishes tactile bias. Rhythmic control under pressure in fitting scene; no POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop in conviction/vertebrae sentence (-0.2) and "shimmering stillness" repetition (-0.2) trigger Q7 artifact cap. Final line’s star imagery rescues momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wildlife rehabber’s precision work as emotional alchemy. Avoids derivative "craft heals trauma" tropes through specific silicone/tail mechanics. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
