<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not defiance but creation") manifests physically through failed dance attempts; embodied emotion peaks with "lightness spreading like warmth" during fledging—no therapy-speak, only visceral sensation. Final renunciation of exile-as-separation earns closure through prior causality of observing gaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "spontaneously anchored" moment crystallizes options with undeniable cost (permanent cosmic verse etching). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (heartbeats, breath pauses)—and the "fledging" image reconfigures exile's meaning while charging the final verse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting: moss-cooled feet tracing currents directly constrains dance tactics, while jasmine/moth gaps charge the climax. Final cosmic verse on skin makes environment indispensable—specificity ("silver-leafed sage," "cool moss") avoids postcard vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (memory as disease vs. cosmic testament) tighten through protagonist’s agency: failed dance attempts deepen knowledge until gap-observation shifts pressure. Cost is legible in "permanent piece of cosmos made manifest"—fledging forecloses his old exile state with visible physical transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through moonstone’s evolution from "forbidden history" to cosmic ink, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("silent, defiant poem for a world that had forgotten how to read") reweights nostalgia ban’s stakes without abstraction—complexity lingers via "obsidian grace" as both beauty and burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "observing gaps" shapes all description (primrose exhalation, star absences). Rhythmic control under pressure peaks with staccato heartbeat/breath focus ("not... but... not... but...") teaching the pattern that pays off in the anchor moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "obsidian grace" repetition earns credit through purposeful reweighting. High density: "pinprick of opalescent light against his skin, a universe of forbidden history in a single mote" compresses backstory/theme without telling. Final line’s "silent, defiant poem" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "nostalgia ban" trope through specific cosmic mechanics (tide dance as gravity-conversation). Risk-taking heightens stakes: exile isn’t passive but the "very condition" enabling fledging. "Fledging" as metaphor for memory rebirth feels inevitable yet fresh—no derivative safety middle.</comment>
