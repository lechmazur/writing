<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias’ "affectionate skeptic" trait manifests through embodied contradiction: biting back doubt yet trusting Lena’s hope, with micro-choices (e.g., "Always" response) revealing his hierarchy of values. Final pulse-connection earns visible cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through dual light paintings; cost ("willowglass hope," pulse contact) is legible on-page. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—somatic sensations accumulate into visual proof without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Light painting studio functions as micro-setting: camera shutter timing and LED wands constrain Elias’ frantic/slow movements, directly shaping tactics. Final image charged by geode’s physical presence in Lena’s palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via somatic escalation (grief → love), narrowing options to mutual vulnerability. Cost—fragile hope replacing skepticism—is unmistakable in Lena’s tear and their intertwined pulses, driven by Elias’ agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light paintings as non-literal answer to "Can connection transcend words?"; final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite Lena’s "we had found our signal" line—it’s character-specific hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("somatic whisper," "fractally precise") and rhythmic control shift from Elias’ clinical thoughts to lyrical movement descriptions. No head-hopping; single POV maintained under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cold dread bloomed... like frost" exemplifies high-density embodiment. Final line’s "steady, somatic marker of her pulse" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy trope through somatic translation method—fresh angle where connection is proven via physical manifestation. Geode’s specificity (not generic crystal) and emotional complexity avoid safety middle.</comment>
