<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grim smile was the uniform of his optimism") and embodied regret ("weight of unspoken words pressed on his chest") feel authentic, but the emotional progression lacks layered contradiction in peak moments; triumph overshadows the "fresh wound" cost without deeper friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("echo of his failure a fresh wound" juxtaposed with triumph), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is anchored by line 3 ("infinite staircase") and disorientation serves the closure's texture-revelation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chipped die) constrains choice and charges the final image ("chip feeling less like a flaw and more like a key"), but the staircase remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics beyond being a canvas metaphor in the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (capturing missed opportunity's texture) tighten through the proof's culmination, with visible cost in the fleeting rupture; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens culminates in the irreversible emotional trade-off of transient triumph versus enduring confinement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the dice's transformation and final "canvas" realization, avoiding moralizing; the ending reweights the staircase's meaning without abstraction, answering the central question through resonant, non-literal imagery ("damp chill of a forgotten evening").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geography of sameness," mathematical cadence) modulates under pressure (e.g., "sound... was not a clatter but a chime"); no head-hopping, with rhythmic control intensifying during the dice roll's crystalline tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("whisper-faint echo of his own breathing" compresses atmosphere and stakes) with precise propulsion; figurative language ("monument to perpetual motion") avoids muddle even in high-pressure beats like the rupture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trope (infinite staircase) transformed via mathematical obsession and texture-seeking; the chipped die's specificity creates freshness, but the "grim optimist" archetype slightly edges toward template without deeper idiosyncrasy beyond intellectual grit.</comment>
