<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's colorblindness drives his unique problem-solving ("innocently cunning" logic), but embodied emotion lacks layering during the climax; Vex's soot-streaked despair feels visceral though her sudden shift to tears lacks contradictory impulse. Micro-choices like arranging plants reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unfurling moonflower crystallizes options with visible cost (Vex's tears, "fragile promise" sphere). Orientation anchors instantly ("ash and smoke" opening), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through plant-pattern escalation. Cost proof evident in soot-streaked tears at resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard's kiln directly enables the resonator creation while "shimmering failures" of glass mirror the theme. Moonflower's unfurling charges the final image, with soot on Vex's cheeks embodying the ash-world constraint. Micro-setting (glass, plants) actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (awakening Lyra) tightens through Elian's plant arrangements and resonator construction. Pressure accumulates via his agency under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to one pure note. Cost is palpable in Vex's tears and the sphere's fragility during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: flawed glass, ash palette, and single-note solution reweight "beauty in imperfection." Final line resonates without moralizing, showing how imperfections birth beauty. Avoids thematic echo despite lyrical conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("shades of ash and smoke"), but rhythmic control falters during the blowing scene—"soft, steady breath" lacks tension modulation. No POV leakage; lexicon stays within Elian's painterly constraints throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile perfection" and "fragile promise" create subtle, purposeful resonance. High density with concrete verbs ("coaxing," "feasted," "trembled") but minor alliteration ("shimmering failures") slightly over-ornaments the courtyard description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bartered awakening" trope through specific mechanics (plant grammar, concertina reed). Colorblind painter's perspective feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes while maintaining clarity through sensory accumulation.</comment>
