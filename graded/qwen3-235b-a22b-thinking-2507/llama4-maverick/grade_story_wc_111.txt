<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; motivation ("prove gardens know gardeners") remains abstractly stated without embodied conflict or visible tradeoffs during pivotal moments like marble polishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds but lacks meaningful escalation; closure (garden knowing dresser) carries emotional weight yet cost remains conceptual without on-page dramatization of sacrifice during the polishing ritual's climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marbles function as micro-setting charging the final image ("shone like small beacons"), though garden maze remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining the dresser's choices or altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove gardens know gardeners") is declared but never concretely tested; measurable luck concept introduces potential pressure that dissipates without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs during the commemorative act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through marble ritual ("symbolized mended deception") and final image ("garden knew them"), avoiding moralizing while offering resonant non-literal answer to central question of reciprocity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in tactile decay imagery ("withered vine," "cracked collection"); rhythmic control intensifies during sunset sequence with purposeful compression paid off in closure's "beacons" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor overwriting in "bittersweet aroma that the dresser found comforting" slightly dulls immediacy; no loops or scaffold, though "withered vine dresser" repetition approaches template cadence in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "measurable luck" with horticultural devotion avoids tropes through concrete marble ritual, yet emotional specificity lacks bold risk-taking beyond melancholic lyricism; transformation feels inevitable but not revelatory.</comment>
