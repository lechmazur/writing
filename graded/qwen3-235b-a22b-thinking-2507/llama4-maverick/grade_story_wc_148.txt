<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks concrete motivation or internal conflict; "overwhelming urge" and "deep connection" are label-only feelings without embodied contradiction. No visible flaw driving mistakes, and closure choice ("pressed on") shows no earned trade-off or cost. Entire arc remains observational, not decisional under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: no clear who/where/when by 120 words beyond vague "lighthouse prison." No discernible drive lens—neither causal progression nor accumulative density—and "before they found the bodies" is unearned foreshadowing. Closure lacks cost legibility; "pressed on" forecloses no path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vivid but decorative description; lighthouse prison and lattice never constrain choices or charge closure. "Copperlight repose" is static atmosphere, not functional micro-setting. Sensory details ("scent of salt") lack urgency-driven selection, failing to narrow perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake signaled early; "chasing whispers" remains abstract with no concrete test. Zero escalation: walking through corridors shows no narrowing options or knowledge shift. "Bodies" mention arrives too late to create pressure, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy is told ("father's legacy bearing down"), not emergent from action. No resonant answer to central question; final image reweights nothing conceptually. Relies on cry-wolf allegory without fresh inflection, risking thematic echo without earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Strong lyrical texture but filter-verb saturation ("could feel," "began to notice") dulls immediacy. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias—POV notices generic "scuffs" and "whispers" without professional or emotional selectivity. Register drifts into abstract diction during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "lattice seemed to sustain impossibilities" muddles physical logic. Template cadence ("He pushed... Inside... As he walked...") and synonym churn ("thread the labyrinth with his own story" repeated 3x). Final-third filter-verb stack disallows 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Derivative premise ("cry wolf boy's son") lacks transformation; lighthouse prison is cliché without fresh logic. Emotional truth is generic—no specific verifiable detail anchors universals. Fails transformation test: swap names/locations, plot remains identical.</comment>
