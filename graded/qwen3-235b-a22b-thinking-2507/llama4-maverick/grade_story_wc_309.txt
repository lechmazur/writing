<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned as no struggle precedes keystone touch. "Trembling hand" and "spirit soar" are label-only embodiments without specific physicality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "renewed purpose" is stated but no visible sacrifice or consequence shown. Mist walking/unstrapping lacks meaningful tension, resolving conflict through convenient discovery rather than agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Spire's "twisted design" and "frosty corridors" create vivid atmosphere, but setting remains decorative backdrop. Folly keystone charges final image ("carrying memory of gentle glow") yet never constrains choices despite "accommodates impossibilities" claim.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative rebirth) signaled early but escalation passive: wandering resolves conflict via discovery, not agency. No trade-off during "unstrap" action; automation threat remains abstract with zero on-page cost for transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly but lacks earned complexity; "sacred in simple" stated rather than wrestled with. Final image avoids moralizing yet misses resonance as hope feels untested by prior struggle with automation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric voice with consistent "luminance" motif, but interiority generic ("spirit soar"). Under stress, thoughts remain perfectly articulate ("inexplicable connection") violating degradation under pressure. No distinct perceptual signature beyond visual focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("lingering luminance" x4) and template cadence in climax: "felt... felt... felt." Overwritten peaks ("surge of energy course through veins") dilute tension. Final paragraph's parallel structure ("With...", "As...") creates mechanical rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Trope of magic restoring creativity feels familiar despite strong spire imagery. Automation backdrop lacks integration with causality; no fresh inflection where premise transforms character choice. Emotional specificity undercut by tidy resolution.</comment>
