<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is abstract ("truth fragile thing") rather than embodied action; micro-choices lack visible trade-offs beyond walking, reducing guilt to label without tactical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: final resolve ("she would uncover truth") lacks legible cost; "sieved hush" remains thematic echo without reconfiguring options; lens ambiguity (textural → causal) undermines payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings constrain choice (sifting as investigative method); lunar glow finale charges final image with decay motif; sensory details reflect urgency without checklist overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) lacks tightening; "sieved hush" pressure remains theoretical; no on-page trade-off or cost scales with guilt—resolution feels preordained without earned escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" concept resonates through driftwood but ends with moralizing ("truth fragile thing"); avoids overt binaries yet final resolve ("uncover truth no matter cost") undermines earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers" driftwood) with rhythmic control; purposeful compression ("sieved hush" definition) taught early and paid in carvings; zero head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Template cadence in opening ("stared... pondered... sipped") dulls immediacy; "mournful sigh" wave description echoes later "sound of waves," creating paraphrase loop; otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist as memory-forger in noir setting; avoids tropes through "sieved hush" specificity; bold risk in textural escalation but resolution retreats to safety-middle ("uncover truth" cliché).</comment>
