<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; locust shell symbolizes fragility yet no visible cost to Luna's choice. Statues' transformation feels unearned without prior struggle or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("mechanical grip loosened"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—Luna faces zero resistance. "Gap between knowing" timeframe remains abstract, failing to tighten tactics as required.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orchard's sensory details (stardust flowers, sweet air) create vivid atmosphere yet remain postcard-like; sky-bridge shines at climax but never constrains choices. Micro-setting potential of locust shell underutilized—handled passively without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("breaking free mechanical world") declared but never tested—no obstacles, tradeoffs, or protagonist-driven escalation. "Resonantly soft" trait has no cost; statues awaken effortlessly, rendering conflict static despite lyrical deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of "tarnished wonder" coheres through orchard rebirth, but final line ("world slowly breaking free") edges toward moralizing. Lacks complexity—beauty's victory is uncomplicated, missing earned ambiguity about mechanical world's tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice has distinct lyrical texture ("blossoming dreams," "gentle breeze that stirs leaves"), but "resonantly soft" overuse (4x) creates tic-like repetition. Emotional descriptions generic ("faces filled with wonder") under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity ("locust shell's delicate curves"), but scaffold loops in opening ("Luna played... Luna's music... Luna began") and redundant "resonantly soft" mentions dull immediacy. No closure-obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orchard/statues trope transformed by mechanical-world contrast, yet "sky-bridge violinist" feels derivative. Fresh angle: music as heart-rhythm signaling—but resolution too neat, avoiding bold risks about beauty's fragility in a tarnished world.</comment>
