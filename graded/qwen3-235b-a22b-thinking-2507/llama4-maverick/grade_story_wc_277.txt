<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation to protect legacy but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "orbits of regret" functions as thematic label-speak rather than active conflict during pivotal pen-nib moment, muting micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "orbits of regret begin to dissipate" as mist clears, crystallizing Adelaide's stance with conceptual weight on legacy transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid mist/cloud imagery mirrors internal state but fails functional requirement; observatory setting remains decorative backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging final image despite atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy vs truth) signaled early but pressure lacks deepening; "proof by contradiction" method announced but never shapes tactics, leaving escalation abstract rather than driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizing ("Wychwood name synonymous with truth, not regret") triggers thematic echo penalty; regret motif remains static abstraction without earned complexity or non-literal reweighting at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature weakens under pressure; repetitive "As she [verb]" cadence and clinical diction ("employ a method... studying mathematics") disrupt voice consistency during critical decision-making moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("gazing out... scanning the horizon") and therapy-speak ("orbits of regret") in final third dull closure impact; filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy during pen-nib handling sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Newsprint heiress trope untransformed; "proof by contradiction" concept feels grafted rather than organically integrated, lacking fresh inflection on legacy narrative through specific lived detail.</comment>
