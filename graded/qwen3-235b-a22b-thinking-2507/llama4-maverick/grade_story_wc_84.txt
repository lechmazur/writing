<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lena's interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany ("missing piece within her all along") feels unearned without prior struggle. "Perpetually surprised" trait never creates tangible trade-offs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Lena's cosmic connection epiphany reconfigures the "frequency" with felt cost (solitary journey's emotional toll). But cost legibility falters—trepidation vanishes too neatly into belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory setting charges closure through star-carvings and "brilliant dimness" atmosphere. Yet tools like the drone/console feel ornamental; no constraint on choices beyond generic "scanning."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("decode frequency") lack escalation—chip found effortlessly via star trails. No narrowing of options or tangible price paid; tension evaporates when the console "sprang to life" without complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo destroys resonance: "frequency... spoke to the very heart of belonging" is explicit moralizing in final paragraph. Conceptual cost (cosmic connection) feels imposed, not earned through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV voice has lyrical consistency but over-relies on stock phrases ("velvet expanse," "diamonds scattered"). Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Lena notices beauty generically, not as a drone pilot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Synonym churn ("thrill of excitement" → "excitement and trepidation") and template cadence ("She entered... she set to work... she pulled out") dull momentum. "Brilliant dimness" overuse strains coherence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Frequency of belonging" trope feels derivative without fresh angle; spiritual-tech fusion lacks specific moral calculus. Emotional truth in Lena's solitude is undercut by pat cosmic resolution.</comment>
