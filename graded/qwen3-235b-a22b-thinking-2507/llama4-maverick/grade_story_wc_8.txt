<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction shallow; "emotionally rational" trait never tested under pressure. Final choice lacks visceral cost despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (sunlight on dust motes) with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks tangible pressure. Ivy's "relaxing" feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivy functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("relaxing grip"), but overreliance on visual decay clichés ("skeletal fingers") prevents 9.0. Sunlight break feels earned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. noble lies) signaled early but remains abstract. No tangible cost beyond emotional satisfaction; "pit of lies" never manifests as concrete obstacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Rescue truth from pit of lies" in final paragraph triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Theme emerges through particulars but resolution oversimplifies complexity with "triumph" framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trained to see beyond veil of time") with rhythmic control, but late shift to passive voice ("the truth began to emerge") dulls pressure in critical beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful texture ("morbid perfume"), but "vibrant colors" repetition and "skeletal fingers" cliché prevent 9.0. Final line’s "small victory" slightly over-tells.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian-as-detective trope through lyrical decay imagery, but "noble lies" concept lacks transformative specificity. Risk-taking in quiet closure elevates within band.</comment>
