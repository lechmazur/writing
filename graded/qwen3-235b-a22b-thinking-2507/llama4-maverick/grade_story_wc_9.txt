<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "willingly perplexed" trait lacks concrete tradeoffs; micro-choices like unfastening the book feel reactive rather than value-driven under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "lost time accumulates in spaces between memories" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost in the saucer's crack symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Midnight glade's ozone/mist functions as micro-setting—constrains perception during the hand-tracing memory, charging the final image of "cloudbound memories" with atmospheric cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory density (cards→saucer→tracings), but "lost time" accumulation lacks visceral escalation; cost remains conceptual rather than altering present tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "fractures in time" reframes cloudbound repentance without moralizing, with the saucer crack offering resonant closure to the central question of time's accumulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("choking beauty," ink-stained fingers) sustains voice, but reflection-led mode risks over-30% BRR without sufficient micro-choices altering present options mid-memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("flickering with otherworldly energy... as if speaking") slightly dull propulsion; near-miss on figurative muddle in "ethereal glow" repetition during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy and time-loss avoids tropes, though "dolls' saucer" risks symbolic convenience; emotional specificity in hand-tracing ritual elevates beyond generic nostalgia.</comment>
