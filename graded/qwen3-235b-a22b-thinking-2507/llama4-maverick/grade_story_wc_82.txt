<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; grief motivation clear but passive contemplation lacks struggle. "Luminous torment" described yet no micro-choices under pressure—releasing the crane is gesture without tactical cost. Interiority poetic but abstract ("sorrow" not embodied specifics).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with sensory density tightening stakes, but closure lacks causality: "grief begin to unfold" feels unearned without prior struggle. Cost ("luminous torment") legible yet decoupled from action—release of crane doesn't alter tactics. Valid Charged Poise RR but missing escalation through agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (origami cranes/lanterns) charges closure: crane release embodies grief transformation. Tea garden's mist and filigree constrain perception ("drifted into view"), but floating islands feel decorative. Strong sensory selectivity—glass basilica's "shard of fallen starlight" mirrors emotional fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief) signaled early, pressure tightens via sensory accumulation. Fatal flaw: zero protagonist agency—Kaito observes/releases but makes no choice altering tactics. "Luminous torment" is cost yet passive; no trade-off forecloses paths. Escalation lacks decision under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through origami/lanterns as grief vessels; final crane release reweights "luminous torment" as active healing without moralizing. "Grief begin to unfold, like lotus petals" crystallizes non-literal answer to art-as-salve. No thematic echo—resonance built from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silken threads," "lunar light") modulates with emotion. Overwriting risks: "ephemeral whispers of subconscious" generic. No POV leaks, but stress compression weak—"tormented soul" tells where embodiment needed. Rhythmic control strong in closure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "transform grief into something tangible, something that could be shaped and molded" then "shape, and to mold." Template cadence in lantern descriptions ("Kaito's thoughts turned to... Kaito's lanterns..."). Final third artifacts prevent 8.0+; lyrical density obscures causal links.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" synthesizes grief/art uniquely, but floating islands feel derivative. Emotional specificity in origami process elevates tropes. Risk-taking in textural escalation pays off, yet tea garden setting lacks fresh inflection. Authentic vision coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
