<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's eccentricity and observational method feel authentic, but stranger remains underdeveloped. Micro-choices like retrieving the boutonnière show value hierarchy, yet internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at pivotal moments. "Jolt of understanding" moment skirts diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of the memories"), but cost proof falters—the abstract "cumulative burden" lacks concrete on-page legibility. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, though reflection fragments slightly exceed BRR limits without altering present tactics. "Boutonnière lying abandoned" crystallizes options but cost needs sharper physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the boutonnière constrains Kael's final choice and charges the ending ("key fitting into a lock"). Mist and dock create purposeful sensory hierarchy, though opal dock's specificity doesn't actively pressure decisions. "Scuffed and dusty" shoes exemplify tactile lived-in detail that elevates environment beyond postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Kael's observations, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—pressure comes from atmosphere, not his choices. "Meaningful tightening" occurs when he decodes the boutonnière as a key, yet no visible price alters tactics. Cost ("weight of memories") feels conceptual but insufficiently embodied in the final beat to reach high bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through lighthouse-as-memory-repository metaphor, with final image reweighting "borrowed memories" as both burden and connection. Avoids moralizing despite "cumulative burden" line skirting abstraction. Edelweiss motif shifts from stranger's gesture to Kael's key, offering resonant non-literal answer to memory's cost without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Kael notices "scuffed shoes" and "gaps" while filtering through lighthouse keeper's lens. Rhythmic control varies effectively between mist's "softly persistent" swirl and urgent realization beats. No POV drift, though "witnessed isolation" repetition slightly dilutes late-momentum. Final paragraph's cadence deepens pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("Kael watched... Kael noticed") create momentum drag in observation beats. "Borrowed memories" concept explained rather than dramatized in one reflective block, bordering on telling. Strong verbs ("swirled," "snapped," "clutched") anchor specificity, but "witnessed isolation" repetition in final third risks thematic echo without sufficient reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope through "borrowed memories" concept avoids cliché with Edelweiss specificity and nautical twilight precision. Emotional truth in quiet connection transcends surface novelty, though risk-taking stops short of bold structural choices. Transformation test passed—plot wouldn't work with generic "flower" or "dusk," yet lacks the distinctive risk distinction for 9+.</comment>
