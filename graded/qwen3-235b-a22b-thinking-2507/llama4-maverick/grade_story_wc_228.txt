<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure absent; "intimately aloof" stated not demonstrated through conflicting choices. Final legacy epiphany told without embodied cost, violating emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: no temporal/spatial anchors by 120 words. Lens ambiguity persists at closure (hybrid Accumulative/Situational), blocking Q2 >7.2. Cost proof weak despite conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (luminescent moss, rough sand) anchor atmosphere but lack causal constraint on choices. Micro-setting (seashell) charges focal point yet fails to shape final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("temporary eternity"); no protagonist-driven escalation. Wrong turn into caves resolves via coincidence, violating "luck may complicate not resolve" rule with zero tactical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fleeting beauty" motif but final paragraph moralizing ("testament to human experience") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in painter's observations, but reflective backstory blocks disrupt psychic distance. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she worked...") and mixed metaphors ("mind ablaze" after "sky ablaze") in peak beats. Scaffold loops reduce momentum; "danced across canvas" repetition weakens density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Specific quay painter details feel fresh but "hidden oasis" trope lacks transformation. Emotional truth in solitude theme elevated by coastal specificity, though risk-taking remains moderate.</comment>
