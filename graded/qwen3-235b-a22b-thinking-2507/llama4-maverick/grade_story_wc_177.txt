<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite clear motivation; "transcend limitations" lacks embodied contradiction. Final realization feels unearned due to passive protagonist with no visible struggle against the core question.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "path had chosen them" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; storm escalation under Accumulative lens tightens thematic pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (wafer seal) charges final image—"shone with new significance"—constraining thematic weight. Bunker/forest descriptions vivid but atmospheric rather than tactically constraining choices earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; storm intensifies passively. Conceptual cost legible at closure, yet agency remains observational without narrowing options mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through "decaying directive" and path-chooser metaphor; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but secondary stake ("ancient power") dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fungal glow/ozone details, rhythmic control under storm pressure. "Precisely playful" repetition shows minor syntactic monotony, but voice modulates effectively toward dreamscape climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>No closure-impairing artifacts; "dance of understood events" to "dance in precisely playful manner" triggers paraphrase loop (−0.2). Figurative density balanced but "ethereal grit" lacks concrete embodiment in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-perception trope via "paths choose walkers" premise; luminescent fungi/decaying directive avoid generic rewilding. Risk-taking in dream logic heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
