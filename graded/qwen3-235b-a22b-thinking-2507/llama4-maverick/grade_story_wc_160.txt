<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; motivation remains abstract contemplation without embodied struggle against the stated conflict. Final realization lacks earned causality from specific prior choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) has felt cost ("weight of her task") but cost proof test fails—no exact sentence/image showing legible price. Encryption method appears late without prior setup, weakening Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the volcano setting, but environment never constrains choices or charges the final image. Micro-setting (chain) described but doesn't alter tactics despite handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs safety) signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening; no reversal or deepening of options. Encryption breakthrough occurs off-page before story starts, leaving escalation static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars initially, but final paragraph violates organic emergence with explicit moralizing: "testament to the power of compassion and unity" triggers thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in volcanic atmosphere, but "dappled resolve" and "tremble" become repetitive tics under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction; lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("stones expanding and contracting" rephrased 3x); filter-verb stacks ("Kaelin felt...") in high-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Final thematic echo compounds line-level opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Volcanic amphitheater offers fresh setting, but "decoding message reveals unity" premise is tropey without transformation. Fails proximity check—emotional arc works unchanged with different location.</comment>
