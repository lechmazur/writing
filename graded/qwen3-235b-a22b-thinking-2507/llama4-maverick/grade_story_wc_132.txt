<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but flaw under stress lacks contradiction; "circuitously sincere" stated not embodied in micro-choices during key pressure moments like the trellis realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation test fails—no clear "when" until paragraph 3; closure lacks felt cost as transformation remains abstract ("she would begin") without tangible forfeiture or altered tactics on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting but fails 9+ gate; it comforts rather than constrains choices (e.g., no physical interaction altering Emilia's actions under pressure).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("restlessness") remain abstract; escalation relies on reflection not agency—no narrowing of options via Emilia's decisions, only passive realization without visible tactical shift or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme derailed by final-paragraph moralizing ("transformation was a path worth traveling"), triggering Thematic Echo penalty; resonance undercut by abstract assertions over earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical details but uniform tics during stress ("felt determination wash over her"); no head-hopping but psychic distance flattens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence run ("She had always... She spent... However...") in paragraph 3 triggers -0.5; paraphrase loops ("serene after rain"/"soft, emerald hue"/"sanctuary") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Derivative premise (nature-as-metaphor) lacks transformation; "reluctant metamorphosis" trope executed generically without fresh inflection on the nursery owner's specific stakes.</comment>
