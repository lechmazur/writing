<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Withdrawn nature evaporates without contradictory impulses; "shivering bliss" and "sense of purpose" lack embodied struggle. Final allegiance feels unearned as no internal conflict precedes the snap's release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options (withdrawn→purposeful) but cost remains abstract "trepidation" without tangible forfeiture. Accumulative lens holds though pressure lacks deepening beyond sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains choices through mystical energy coalescence, with glass walls rippling as pressure point. Final golden light charges closure, though "endless night" lacks causal interaction beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("capture possibility") intensify through sensory escalation but lack concrete cost—no trade-off when merging with the entity. Agency feels passive as energies "surge through" rather than knight's active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</comment><comment>Theme of possibility emerges through "shape" motif but final moralizing ("journey far from over") undercuts earned resonance. CR succeeds via crumpled program reprise yet lacks conceptual cost beyond vague "allegiance."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispering trees" and "tang of mystical experimentation" but collapses under stress with uniform "shimmering entity" abstractions. No head-hopping but psychic distance flattens during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure beat suffers from paraphrase loops ("murmured allegiance still echoed"/"connection to Lysander") and therapy-speak ("shivering bliss"). Final "golden light" lacks textural specificity, dulling the payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shape of possibility" transforms puppetry trope through alchemical lens yet relies on mystical vagueness. Bold structural risk in Accumulative escalation undermined by generic "endless night" setting.</comment>
