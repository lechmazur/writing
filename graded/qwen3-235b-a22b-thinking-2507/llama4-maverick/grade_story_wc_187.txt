<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("sculpt identity") remains abstract despite clear stakes; "preemptively nostalgic" is label-only trait without embodied cost. Contradictory impulses absent—archivist's choices lack internal friction despite high-stakes role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight lift," moon's light), but causal escalation is passive (storm clearing); protagonist agency in pressure buildup is underdeveloped despite valid Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt charges closure (memories flood → fading whisper), constraining choice via tactile interaction. Sensory specificity in "wet stone/ozone" and shadow-length measurements grounds the lyrical tone without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory) tightens via storm's clearing, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; cost ("weight lift") feels emotional rather than tactical. Agency passive until final touch of crystal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal's memory surge, but "guardian of collective memory" articulation risks thematic echo. Final image reweights past via "river" metaphor, yet wisdom edges toward abstraction without concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadow lengths" and "preemptively nostalgic" lexicon; rhythm modulates from storm's chaos to hushed reverence. Minor POV leakage in "collective memory swirled around her" blurs focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in "thousand tiny sparks" dilutes storm tension; filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster in high-pressure beats. Final image ("stars twinkling like diamonds") avoids cliché with precise textural charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-guardian via tactile shadow analysis, but "crystal forecourt" trope lacks transformation. Emotional truth in identity-sculpting resonates, though setting risks generic mysticism without deeper world logic.</comment>
