<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior conflict remains abstract ("torn between two forces") with no contradictory impulses in action; "mulberry ache" is diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. Final choice lacks earned causality despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise but cost ("mulberry ache") is stated not shown; coffee stain reading creates pattern without narrowing options. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof fails at decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry ("velvet observatory," "crimson and gold sky") anchors early, but setting remains decorative—no environmental constraint on choices. Micro-setting (orchid, violin) lacks causal pressure despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream vs empire) stays abstract; no escalation as empire exerts zero on-page pressure. "Weight of empire" declared but never materializes, leaving stakes untested and cost unearned in tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" functions as thematic echo rather than emergent concept; final paragraph’s "truth... hidden in threads" states moral instead of offering resonant image. Complexity undercut by abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice falters under pressure: repetitive "Elian’s..." openings and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy. "Mulberry ache" violates POV lexicon with therapy-speak in peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("promise... losing its glow" → "act before too late") and template cadence ("As she...") in final beat. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate") and final "she knew" triplet obscure closure image with scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ice violin and plant telepathy offer fresh inflection but remain ornamental—no transformation of tropes through specific stakes. Emotional truth diluted by generic "empire vs dream" framework without verifiable detail.</comment>
