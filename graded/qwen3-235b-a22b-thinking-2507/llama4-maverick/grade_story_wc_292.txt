<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("nervously confident") lacks embodied tradeoffs; copper nail's "strange energy" drives action but feels externally imposed rather than character-specific. No visible cost to Emilia's choices beyond abstract dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (dread crystallizing her resolve) with felt cost, but "spongey dread" remains abstract—no concrete image to anchor the conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds, yet escalation lacks pressure tightening beyond atmospheric thickening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Weather station's "fragile bubble" metaphorically pressures choices but never constrains action; copper nail's physicality is noted yet unused. "Spongey dread" dominates sensory detail but operates as thematic label rather than embodied constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) lacks narrowing options; pressure accumulates only through dread density without tactical shifts. No on-page cost beyond psychological unease—Emilia's "kinship" with sailor deepens but doesn't alter her research methods or risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "reversible exile" resonates through coded stanzas and copper nail, but final image ("dread seeping into her being") states rather than reweights the concept. Avoids moralizing yet lacks concrete aftereffect beyond abstract unease.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map/weather metaphors ("jet stream shift," "hidden patterns"), but "spongey dread" and "strange energy" drift into thematic abstraction under pressure. Consistent single-POV interiority avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in repetitive "Emilia's..." openings (7 instances) dulls momentum; "spongey dread" functions as mixed metaphor violating physical logic. High-pressure beats ("dread surrounding her grew thicker") suffer stock phrasing that obscures emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking and ancestral trauma is undercut by "reversible exile" as vague thematic device. Weather station setting feels derivative of climate-fiction tropes without specific lived-in detail to ground the premise.</comment>
