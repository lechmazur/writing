<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("steadily curious by nature") dominates interiority; no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Final smile lacks earned weight as no visible cost or struggle alters her state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise at dawn) lacks cost proof: no on-page sentence concretely shows sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost ambiguity prevents higher band despite atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vivid rain/skylight imagery but fails 9+ gate: setting never constrains choices. Measuring tape as micro-setting remains ornamental—coiled passively without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No escalation: declared stakes ("map cultural patterns") face zero concrete opposition. Static conflict without transformation; cryptocurrency crashes remain abstract backdrop, not live pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("not just about deciphering patterns...") violates Q5 penalty guidance. Abstract statements ("complex interplay") replace earned resonance through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Uniform "steadily curious" tics flatten voice; perceptual signature lacks cartomancer-specific bias. Register drift ("tangible representation," "palpable") undermines POV plausibility during high-focus work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Template cadence ("With each...") and paraphrase loops ("mystery deepening"/"fabric revealed") dull momentum. Filter-verb stack in closure beat ("felt herself becoming a conduit") triggers -1.0 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Derivative premise: cartomancer decoding post-crash chaos works identically if swapped for "data analyst." Zero fresh synthesis—cryptocurrency crashes serve as vague topical garnish, not integrated logic.</comment>
