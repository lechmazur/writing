<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("teach darkness stars") is told not shown; zero contradictory impulses or embodied emotion beyond labels like "spiralingly calm." Guardian remains a blank slate with no micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure (stars twinkling as "value of light") lacks legible cost—dissipating "stillwater tension" is conceptual but feels unearned. Accumulative lens holds, yet no felt price anchors the reconfiguration at the pivotal ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cobalt dock’s wet reflection and dental mirror charge the final image, but setting rarely constrains choices—ozone scent and shutters feel decorative rather than pressure-driving in this single-scene scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("teach darkness stars") remain abstract declarations; no tangible cost or option-narrowing. The figure’s shutter pattern deepens atmosphere but fails to escalate pressure into a live trade-off or tactical shift under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through star/darkness imagery, but the final moralizing ("celestial showcase of value") replaces earned resonance with stated meaning, undercutting Q5’s non-literal answer requirement despite lyrical setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("cobalt dock glistened," "ozone scent"), but focalization lacks character-particular bias—POV filters generic poetic observations, not a guardian’s embodied priorities under tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops ("stillwater tension" x4, "silent empathy" x3) and therapy-speak ("spiralingly calm") in closure beats dull immediacy; final image’s lyricism can’t offset scaffolded redundancy across the dock scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tropes (mystical guardian, symbolic mirror) lack fresh synthesis—transformed only by vague poetic language, not specific lived detail. Risk-taking in tone feels derivative of atmospheric minimalism without coherent conceptual stakes.</comment>
