<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; Elian's "exhilarating yet terrifying" experience is label-only emotion without embodied struggle. Micro-choices absent during pivotal retrocognition moment. Diagnostic phrasing ("disorienting, yet exhilarating") triggers anti-pattern penalty. Occupation detail (hedge maze designer) remains superficial despite thematic relevance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity past midpoint: shifts from causal ("determined to unlock") to accumulative without clear teaching. Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof—"boundaries began to blur" is vague, not visceral. Orientation solid but lens instability undermines escalation coherence. No visible price charges the final gathering gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid but setting fails to constrain choices—winding paths could've affected navigation yet remain decorative. Micro-setting opportunity missed (hat/halo unused as tools). Final image (gathering fragment) isn't charged by garden specifics despite lyrical description. Cap at 8.8 per 9+ gate as environment doesn't shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist agency—escalation driven by fragment's magic, not Elian's choices. No visible price paid; "terrifying" is label-only without tactical consequence. Under accumulative lens, density increases but cost remains abstract, failing band guardrail for 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "texture of time" particulars but final paragraph commits Thematic Echo: "unlock a deeper understanding" states thesis in prompt-like language (-0.7). Avoids binaries yet moralizing ("reverence," "hidden harmony") replaces earned resonance. Strength: lyrical progression from abstract concept to lotus metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("dappled shadows," "vibrant life") but filter-verb stacks ("Elian felt," "began to grasp") dull climax immediacy. Register drift with academic terms ("retrocognitively trapped") violates POV lexicon. Rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beat via template cadence ("As they [verb], [subject] [verb]").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in climax: "disorienting, yet exhilarating... exhilarating and terrifying" with synonym churn. Template cadence runs (5+ "As they..." constructions) in final third trigger -1.1 penalty. Overwritten metaphors ("dissolving into quaking reverie... dreamscape... hidden harmony") blur clarity. Strength: opening sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hedge maze/time texture synthesis feels fresh initially but halo fragment is derivative McGuffin—swap "crystal" and story unchanged (fails transformation test). Safety-middle hedging in closure: gathering fragment avoids bold risk. Derivative premise guardrail (-0.7) applies despite lyrical execution. No fresh inflection in pivotal moment.</comment>
