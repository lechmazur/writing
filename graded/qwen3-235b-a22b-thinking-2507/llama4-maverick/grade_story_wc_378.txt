<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("inner static," "fragmented wholeness") in peak beats undermines embodied emotion; contradictory impulses (duty vs. escape need) are clear but resolution feels tidily rational without layered irrationality during fire containment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but "cost proof" fails—perseverance through heat/smoke is summarized, not dramatized with visible sacrifice; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but cost legibility weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (glass dome) constrains choice by amplifying flames to create claustrophobia, directly shaping containment tactics; recurring box charges final image as weight shifts from burdensome to manageable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (resolving inner static) tighten credibly through fire's escalation, but cost remains abstract—physical strain is noted but lacks tangible consequence altering tactics; agency-driven deepening suffices for length yet feels undershot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through desert rose renewal mirroring android's healing; final image reweights "fragmented wholeness" as resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct android perceptual signature (scent/hum focus) anchors voice, but filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she knew") during fire scene dull immediacy; capped per Q7 penalty though rhythm modulates effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack ("Aria felt... she knew... Aria watched") in high-pressure fire beat triggers −0.5 penalty; paraphrase loops ("inner static" repetition) and minor overwriting obscure propulsion despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android "childhood fears" box with controlled burn metaphor avoids tropes; risk-taking in emotional android portrayal heightens stakes coherently, though desert rose setting leans slightly generic.</comment>
