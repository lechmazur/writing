<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("sense of purpose," "whispers of the past") without embodied contradiction; motivation for reviving languages lacks friction against tangible urban pressures. No micro-choices under stress—only uniform hopefulness despite smog-choked setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) fits Accumulative lens but cost remains conceptual ("smog receded") without felt trade-off. Critical failure: zero escalation—no narrowing of options or deepening pressure beyond static internal resolve. Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies for two distinct issues (weak cost, no escalation).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("saffron quiet," "waxing moon’s silver glow") anchors atmosphere, but setting functions decoratively—rooftop greenhouse and brush never constrain choices or charge closure. Smog is backdrop, not operational pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness exists via lost languages) declared early but never tested; city’s smog/choked air poses no active resistance. Zero tightening of options—painter faces no opposition, making stakes abstract. Band guardrail violated: no foreclosed path or visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-connection emerges organically through brush/quiet motifs, but final paragraph’s "beauty and connection were always within reach" states moral directly, triggering -0.7 penalty for thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("saffron quiet," "kaleidoscope of faces") shines, but peak-beat interiority devolves into label-speak ("heart swelled with hope") without stress-induced syntactic compression. No head-hopping, but emotional calibration feels uniformly serene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: 4/5 sentences during painting climax use stacked metaphors ("sea of color and sound," "dance of hope") without pattern-teaching, triggering -0.5. Paraphrase loop ("smog receded"/"din seeped back") adds -0.2, dulling closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic revival and urban isolation falters with derivative "moon-tipped brush" trope. Emotional truth anchors universals, but premise lacks risk—smog-choked city never challenges painter’s resolve, avoiding bold stakes.</comment>
