<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete grief embodiment but resolves too neatly; "loosened grief began to lift" lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal insight. No visible struggle with scientific motivation beyond epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lacks legible cost: "spirit renewed" negates grief's weight without showing sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds but final image ("messy and beautiful place") states theme rather than reconfiguring stakes through action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Braided ravine functions as micro-setting through foam patterns that directly trigger the scientific insight. Chrysalis reappears in final image charging closure, though river sounds verge on symbolic convenience without constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief resolution) remains abstract; no on-page test of "atoning" beyond passive observation. Insight "sparks excitement" without narrowing options or showing trade-offs—escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chrysalis/foam metaphors but final paragraph moralizes ("world was messy and beautiful") violating organic emergence. "Translate separation into connection" is stated verbatim as prompt-like thematic echo, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chemist’s foam analysis and symphonic sound interpretation. Consistent focalization avoids therapy-speak; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s "melody lingered" reprise without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("lapping of water... soothing melody" / "sound of water... like music") trigger -0.2. Strong textural specificity in "intricate networks of fibers" but "loosened grief" drifts into diagnostic label-speak near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science and grief through foam/chrysalis motifs, but emotional resolution avoids risk by skipping struggle. Authentic detail in chemist’s process lifts tropes, though "divergent path" metaphor feels over-signaled.</comment>
