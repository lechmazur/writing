<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("welcome nuance") without embodied micro-choices; "incisively kind" trait is label-only with no tradeoffs. Parrotfish interaction lacks contradictory impulses, reducing emotional complexity to tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost (abandoned certainty), but ampoule revelation arrives deus ex machina without prior causality. Structural weakness insight lacks setup, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Underwater garden described vividly but functions as postcard backdrop; coral/anemones "swaying like ballerinas" offers no constraint on choices. Ampoule's arrival lacks environmental logic, missing micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding downfall) is clear but pressure never escalates—the statue passively receives revelations. Structural weakness insight appears abruptly with no narrowing of options or felt cost until abstract final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs certainty emerges organically through garden's decay/beauty duality, avoiding moralizing. Final ampoule image reweights prior material, though "power of adaptability" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice shifts from lyrical ("coral swayed like ballerinas") to abstract summary ("nuanced narrative"). Telepathic communication lacks character-specific perception; parrotfish thoughts sound identical to statue's narration, flattening focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Loops plague key beats: "thread together fragments... piecing together narrative" followed by "thread together fragments... revealing new insights." Filter-verb stacks ("reached out," "felt," "saw," "realized") dull immediacy during revelation climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structural weakness angle (vs typical environmental disaster) shows ingenuity, but sentient statue trope remains underdeveloped. "Animate lifeless" tone coheres yet avoids bold risk—fresh inflection exists but lacks transformative execution.</comment>
