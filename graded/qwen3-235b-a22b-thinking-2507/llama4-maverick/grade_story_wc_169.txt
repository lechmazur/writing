<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("puzzle out equations for hope") remains abstract label without embodied contradiction; "heart pounding" lacks physical cost to ground her endurance. Flaw: diagnostic self-awareness ("logical dreamer") replaces authentic struggle under vision's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as vision fades to grotto patterns, but cost ("heart pounding") is told not shown—no visceral consequence alters her final stance. Strength: Accumulative lens holds as decorations/gauge deepen "serene upheaval" toward crystallized peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: altitude gauge’s pulsing light charges closure, yet grotto itself remains passive backdrop. Flaw: "tide-polished" specificity never constrains Aria’s pattern-making choices despite lyrical description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("equations for hope") deepen through vision’s multiverse scale, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Aria reacts to visions rather than choices narrowing options. Cost remains conceptual, not felt in body or tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through patterns/gauge, but "puzzle out new equations for hope" is thematic echo—prompt-like language replaces earned resonance. Strength: final image ("trial balloons would continue to fly") reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates well under pressure ("exhilarating and terrifying"), but "lucidly watchful" and "serene upheaval" are therapy-speak intrusions. Perceptual signature strong yet diction drifts into academic ("conceptual repricing" implied).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose loops dilute momentum: "arranging objects into intricate patterns was meditative" then "decorations taking on life." Critical flaw: "serene upheaval" in vision beat is stock metaphor, dulling closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "logical dreamer" with altitude gauge avoids trope, but "parallel timelines" feels derivative. Strength: risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, yet safety-hedging in tidy resolution.</comment>
