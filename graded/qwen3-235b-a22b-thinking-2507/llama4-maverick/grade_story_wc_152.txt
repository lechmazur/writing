<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("disguises wisdom as foolishness") lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; motivation (unraveling coup) remains abstract despite clear stakes, with no embodied trade-offs during stitching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: conspiracies are "uncovered" but no visible sacrifice or consequence (e.g., "secrets would change history" is thematic assertion, not earned cost); lens ambiguity between Accumulative/Textural and Causal weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("cobalt observatory," "velvet cloth") anchors setting early, but micro-setting (embroidery tools) fails to constrain choices or charge closure; candle flame's "dancing" is atmospheric without tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>Stakes (coup) declared early but never tested through protagonist action; pressure remains static ("urgency grows" without narrowing options), with coincidence (candle glow) replacing earned escalation under any drive lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("secrets would change history") triggers -0.6 penalty; "unheard stories" concept lacks organic emergence, resolving into abstract moralizing rather than resonant image-driven subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("threads shimmer and glow") creates textural cohesion, but syntactic monotony ("as if...") and elevated diction ("unseen force") dilute pressure during high-stakes moments like coup revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("shimmer and glow"/"shimmering threads") and template cadence ("as if guided... as if it too...") obscure causality; overwriting in peak beats ("vibrate with otherworldly energy") muddles closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Galaxy-chart embroiderer" synthesizes tropes freshly, but cobalt observatory/eternal candle feel derivative; risk-taking (textural accumulation) lacks conceptual integrity as poetic devices don't constrain choices or reweight stakes.</comment>
