<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("serene anger") shown through embodied perception but motivation ("understand time dilation") remains abstractly stated without tangible stakes or visible cost beyond epiphany; missing person lacks agency to test Kael's limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (time's mystery accepted), but orientation falters: "wind-carved encampment" lacks spatial specificity past 120 words, muddying tactical constraints; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet causality feels passive (drone "darted ahead" vs. Kael's agency).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: wind-carved rocks dictate search patterns, ink residue becomes micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory details ("iridescent feathers glimmering") filtered through Kael's tracking focus avoid tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover time dilation truth) signaled early but lacks escalation; "serene anger" isn't leveraged as pressure—no trade-offs or narrowing options until climax, where cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink patterns and drone, but final paragraph's "wove a tale of patterns and time" edges toward thematic echo; avoids sentimentality yet closure's wisdom ("glimpse into mystery") feels unearned by concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tracker's pattern-focused noticing) shines, but "consciously wild hair" disrupts voice consistency; tense/stance stable yet drone's "comforting constant" anthropomorphism slightly leaks POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythm with varied syntax ("Their consciously wild hair...whipped about"), but adjacent paraphrase loops ("faint smudge...faintest hint") and elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy without pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disappearing ink as time-perception metaphor feels inevitable; albino tracker trope transformed through wind-carved setting specificity, though "serene anger" lacks bold risk-taking beyond lyrical surface.</comment>
