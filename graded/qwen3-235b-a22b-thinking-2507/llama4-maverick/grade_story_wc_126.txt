<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; motivation clear but change lacks struggle. Bowl connection tells rather than shows embodied conflict. Final choice (accepting imperfect beauty) lacks visible cost or prior causality buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis valid (hush transformed but persistent), cost legible in "reminder of beauty." But Accumulative escalation falters—music's transformative effect occurs without pressure buildup or narrowing options, violating lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory density (charred earth scent, glass "shards of ice") anchors setting early. Yet no element constrains choice—shipwrecks and bowl remain ornamental. Final stars image lacks charging specificity to reach 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stake (finding beauty in desolation) signaled but pressure never tightens. Music resolves hush without earned struggle or visible cost—transformation feels coincidental, violating Accumulative escalation’s need for density increase that reweights stakes under protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bowl/music, but final line ("beauty that could be found in the stillness") states the central question’s answer literally, bordering on thematic echo and undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive" shown via vibration descriptions) shines. However, "chronic hush" repetition creates template cadence in high-pressure beats, dulling momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("chronic hush" x4, "beauty in the unfinished" x2) and generic abstractions ("vibrant green amidst desolation") dilute density. Final-third scaffold ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") obscures closure’s cost legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Echo-harbor violinist" and bowl offer fresh inflection, but shipwrecks in rainforest setting contradict logic, undermining authenticity. Emotional arc feels derivative despite lyrical specificity in key images.</comment>
