<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; motivation is pure competence without struggle. Energy beings adjust conveniently, removing resistance. Final choice lacks visible cost—balance restored too smoothly. Embodied emotion ("soothing vibrations") strong but no contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis (balance restored), but cost is abstract—"delicate harmony" threatened, not paid. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via crack-pattern shifts, yet escalation lacks agency; cave "begins to change" passively. No Orientation Test penalty, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence showing sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harmonic caves render vividly through micro-setting (ice cracks, echo stone). Stone constrains choice—mapkeeper relies on it to sense resonance shifts. Final image ("woven together by threads of vibration") charged by object. Misses 9+ gate: environment doesn’t shape tactics (success requires only observation).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cacophony vs. quiet) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful trade-offs. Energy beings adjust without friction; no live option foreclosed. Pressure deepens via crack patterns, yet cost remains conceptual ("delicate balance") not visceral. Agency passive—change happens *to* her, not *through* her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through attention emerges organically: "threads of vibration" final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo—no character states thesis. But lacks complexity; "bloom of hush" resolves discord too neatly, denying counter-readings. No false equivalence, yet cost feels unearned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: POV filters everything through resonance ("hammered repose," "crack patterns"). Rhythmic control in "luminous object that resonated" cadence. No head-hopping; focalization stable. Minor register drift: "deep motivation" feels clinical mid-crisis, slightly disrupting voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean grammar but subtle loops: "began to examine... began to notice" cadence in pivotal beat. "Gently luminous" appears twice without evolution. Final paragraph ("testament to the power...") slightly overwrought, diluting closure. No fatal artifacts, but density dips in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bloom of hush" trope transformed via sensory specificity (ice cracks, resonant stone), but energy beings lack fresh inflection—generic disruptors. Emotional truth in "quiet in the storm" desire, yet avoids risk: resolution is safe middle ground. No derivative premise guardrail, but no bold structural risk either.</comment>
