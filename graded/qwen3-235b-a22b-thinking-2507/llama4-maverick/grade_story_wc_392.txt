<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("scent of damp earth," "weight of the past") but "watchfully calm" remains stated trait rather than demonstrated through constrained choices under pressure; micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs despite strong emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves valid Charged Poise ("lantern's light seemed to shine brighter") with felt cost of past liberation, but post-drought timeframe fails to tighten decisions as required by Accumulative lens; orientation clear by 60 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tunnel atmosphere vividly rendered ("dripping water," "rusty pipes"), yet setting doesn't constrain choices—it's backdrop not active pressure; lantern as micro-setting charges final image sufficiently for band entry but misses 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (solving death/breaking free) signaled early with one meaningful deepening at "Free at last" inscription, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; pressure accumulates texturally yet cost remains abstract without tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of liberation emerges organically through tunnel/lantern motifs without moralizing; final image ("rain-washed world") reweights darkness into renewal as resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitive to residual emotions") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor filter-verb stacks ("Maya felt") in high-tension beats prevent 9.0 despite clean focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("entangled memories"/"shedding a skin") and abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability") create scaffold; final beat clear yet lacks zero-loop precision for 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of investigator role with emotional liberation arc; lantern's Underground Railroad history transforms trope, but tunnel/drought elements feel derivative without sufficient lived-in detail for 8.8+.</comment>
