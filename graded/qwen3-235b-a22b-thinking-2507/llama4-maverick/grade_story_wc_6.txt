<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion in grafting scene but "prove scars can sing" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat (line 13), undermining earned contradiction. Flaws complicate choices yet epiphany feels unearned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (scars harmonized, not erased), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase; rain arrival deepens atmosphere without narrowing options or reweighting stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Black sand pouch functions as micro-setting charging final image ("stirring in her pouch"), yet volcanic beach remains backstory-only. Sensory details are selective but fail to constrain choices during grafting—environment stays atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing emotional scars through action) is signaled early, but escalation lacks visible cost escalation; grafting choice reweights meaning without narrowing options or altering tactics under pressure, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting metaphor yet "scars can sing" is overt thematic echo (line 13), triggering -0.5 penalty. Final image resonates but moralizing language undercuts earned subtext, preventing non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV maintains stable perceptual signature (cloud shadows, kelp-drift peace) but abstract phrases like "unyielding compassion" drift into therapy-speak. Voice modulates effectively yet lacks rhythmic distinction under peak stress during grafting sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in final third ("Aria felt a sense of peace... Aria felt a deep sense of connection") triggers -0.5 penalty. Template cadence ("Aria felt...") dulls closure image despite otherwise clean syntax and purposeful sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise (firefighter daughter of arsonist) offers fresh angle yet execution relies on familiar healing-through-nature tropes. "Scars can sing" metaphor feels derivative; risk-taking avoids gimmickry but lacks bold transformation of emotional calculus.</comment>
