<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "spark of defiance" remains abstract label without embodied cost. No visible struggle or trade-offs in choices despite high stakes. Final "smile" reveals no earned change or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density buildup, but conceptual cost remains abstract future promise ("carrying message forward"). Orientation delayed past 120 words (thoughts-tax revealed paragraph 4), weakening causality anchor. Closure lacks felt price on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (scent of flowers, rustle of leaves) function decoratively without constraining choices. Gourd rattle seed appears symbolically but never pressures tactics—fails micro-setting gate for 9+ band. Greenhouse backdrop remains postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thoughts-tax resistance) declared but never tested; Lyra plants messages unimpeded with zero opposition. No tightening of options or deepening of knowledge—escalation absent despite "converging chaos" claims. Stakes remain abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "spark of defiance" motto and final "unbreakable spirit" moralize explicitly. Resistance theme stated repeatedly without emergent complexity—closure replaces scene pressure with sermonizing ("testament to human ingenuity").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV stable but generic; "converging chaos" lacks character-specific perceptual signature. Syntax flattens under pressure ("As [time], Lyra [verb]") with no rhythmic modulation. "Candidly cryptic" trait never manifests in distinctive diction or thought patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence loops: "As [time], Lyra [verb]" repeats 3x with identical structure. Therapy-speak ("converging chaos of thoughts") and mixed metaphor ("tapestry of meaning") dilute momentum. Final paragraph overwrites with abstract summarization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thoughts-tax premise derivative of dystopian tropes without fresh inflection. Gourd rattle seed feels like forced exoticism rather than organic detail. Emotional specificity absent—resistance framed in generic heroic terms without authentic human complexity.</comment>
