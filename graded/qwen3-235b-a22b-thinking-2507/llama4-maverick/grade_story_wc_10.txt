<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("balm to frazzled nerves") without embodied contradiction; survivor's capsize trauma informs motivation vaguely but lacks specific flaw-driven struggle during tuning fork adjustment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof: "pang of gratitude" and "music carried" show no legible sacrifice or altered options; lens (Accumulative) holds but pressure never tightens beyond aesthetic refinement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory anchors sensory specificity ("frosted panes," "quivering leaves"), yet setting functions as passive backdrop rather than constraining choice; heat-map device lacks tactile integration with environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) never faces concrete test; "rectify discord" lacks escalation as tuning fork adjustment requires no meaningful trade-off or cost, reducing conflict to technical calibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" concept remains decorative theme rather than integrated pressure; final line echoes opening imagery without reweighting stakes through earned character shift or conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV voice maintains consistent lyrical texture ("beauty preserved like a delicate flower in ice"), but emotional descriptions default to abstract labels ("sense of peace," "depth of emotions") during pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with rhythmic control yet over-relies on stock phrases ("frayed nerves," "wordless language"); minor scaffold in heat-map description ("danced across its screen, a mesmerizing display") dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concept of silent music offers fresh angle, but execution relies on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes; risk-taking in sensory substitution feels underdeveloped without meaningful constraints on the characters' process.</comment>
