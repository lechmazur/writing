<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in profession (ink wilts near dishonesty) drives obsession with truth, but interior contradiction lacks concrete embodiment; "appreciation growing" is abstract, not visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost (fragility/beauty realization), but minimal escalation under Accumulative lens; journey lacks tangible pressure narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Toxic mist and gilded-leaf scripts constrain choices and charge final image ("misty rain continued to fall, a reminder of fragility, but also beauty"); micro-setting elevates closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs decay) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; journey feels unimpeded, missing visible cost during descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lost conversations' repository, but "appreciation growing" edges toward thematic echo; final image reweights fragility/beauty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (calligrapher's attention to script/texture) modulates with pressure; no head-hopping, though reflection slightly over-abstracts in chamber scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("shimmer in dim light"), but "transience and beauty" risks abstract tell; final line's concrete reprise avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopia + calligraphy; toxic mist reframes "beauty" in closure, but "lost conversations" concept lacks non-obvious moral calculus for 9.0+.</comment>
