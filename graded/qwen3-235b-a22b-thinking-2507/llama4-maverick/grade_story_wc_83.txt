<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amira’s trauma manifests in generic phrases like "bleak exhilaration" rather than embodied contradiction; Dr. Patel exists solely as a plot device with no status dynamics. Diagnostic label "intangibly tangible essence" in climax triggers -0.4 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure attempts Charged Poise but lacks concrete cost—crystal’s "otherworldly energy" feels unearned. Orientation is clear (wedding wreckage → observatory), but "unused potential" remains abstract, failing cost proof test at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Smoke/blood scent grounds early trauma, but observatory lacks tactile specificity; geode crystal fails micro-setting gate—it never constrains choices despite repeated handling. Final image charges no prior motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("forces that destroyed her wedding") with no dramatized test; "hunt" involves passive data analysis, not narrowing options. Pressure never tightens—circuit breakers’ cooling timeframe is ignored after setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme collapses into thematic echo: Amira names "unfiltered awakening" as concept, and ending sermonizes about "forging a new path." Final paragraph moralizing triggers -0.7 penalty for stated moral replacing scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV slips into explanatory narration ("Dr. Patel had been analyzing ripple effects") breaking Amira’s trauma-filtered perception. "Intangibly tangible" jargon violates her plausible lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" and "intangibly tangible" are therapy-speak loops; geode crystal described identically twice ("clutched in her hand"). Template cadence ("As she stood... As she boarded...") dulls high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Perturbation theory feels like sci-fi dressing for generic trauma recovery; swapping "geode" for "amulet" changes nothing. Derivative premise guardrail applies—no fresh inflection beyond surface novelty.</comment>
