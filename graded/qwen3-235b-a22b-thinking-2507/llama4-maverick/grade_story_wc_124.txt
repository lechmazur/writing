<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied grief via scent-triggered memories, but "diagnostic label-speak" ("to understand why some smells triggered powerful emotions") undermines mid-crisis authenticity. Contradictory impulses (holding/emptying vial) lack escalation; grief release feels passive rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: unclear who/where/when past 120 words (vague "greenhouse for extinct plants" anchor delayed). Accumulative lens holds, but Earned Stasis closure lacks legible cost—tears release isn't charged with tangible forfeiture. UV light activation feels coincidental, not pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped per Orientation Test penalty in Q2. Sensory details (scent, UV patterns) vividly anchor atmosphere, but greenhouse functions as static backdrop rather than constraining choice. Micro-setting object (vial) charges final image yet environment never pressures tactics during grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memories' impact) signaled early but pressure stagnates; UV "transformation" externally resolves tension without Elara's agency. No visible price paid—grief release alters no tactics. Stakes remain abstract despite sensory immersion, failing to narrow options or deepen knowledge meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Capped due to Q4 ≤6.9. Theme emerges organically through vial/greenhouse particulars, avoiding moralizing. Final image (empty vial as memory vessel) offers resonant non-literal answer, but lacks conceptual cost—sorrow "washed over her" without irreversible tradeoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Capped per Orientation penalty. Distinct perceptual signature ("aromatically cautious," light-focused diction) shines, but rhythmic control falters in grief beat with repetitive "Elara felt..." phrasing. Single POV stable, yet clinical motivation statement ("to understand why...") jars voice during peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in sensory prose, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("memories that threatened to overwhelm her"/"memories that had shaped her") dull closure beat. "Crystal shadows" repetition lacks pattern-teaching; near-synonym churn ("familiar sting of tears"/"tears she had carried") edges toward scaffold in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tropes (healing through nature/memory) transformed via specific vial/UV details, but emotional arc remains predictable. "Wistful lantern broker" adds freshness yet feels ornamental—no synthesis with grief stakes. Risks (lyric structure) heighten mood but don't deepen conflict stakes beyond expected catharsis.</comment>
