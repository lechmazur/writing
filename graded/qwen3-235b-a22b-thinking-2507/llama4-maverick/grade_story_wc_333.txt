<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or embodied emotion; "improbable longing" is label-only feeling without prior struggle. Micro-choices lack hierarchy (e.g., disorientation method undefined). Final "satisfaction and wonder" feels unearned given zero visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: "shadowed nexus" remains unanchored past 120 words, harming spatial coherence. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("releasing a piece of themselves"), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative pressure weakens during hair-unlocking beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but setting ornamental; "ancient stones" and "latticework branches" never constrain choices. Micro-setting (lock of hair) charges closure image weakly—its "shimmering light" lacks tangible impact on environment beyond vague "seep."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing trapped idea) signaled early, pressure tightens as "air thickens." But cost remains abstract—"improbable longing" isn't legible as sacrifice. Agency present (disorientation), yet tension lacks visceral stakes beyond poetic description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hair lock's transformation, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "enveloped secrets" as liberation, but abstract "idea/memory" weakens resonance. Misses 9+ gate by lacking concrete emotional aftereffect beyond "wonder."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with stellar rhythm ("soft click echoing through the clearing"), but "improbable longing" slips into therapy-speak. Perceptual signature consistent (starlight as guide), though tension dilutes under pressure with overwrought phrasing ("hush of cosmic possibility").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until climax: "tools... used with finesse" shows concrete action. But "surge of improbable longing" is label-heavy; "cosmic possibility" repetition creates synonym churn. Final line ("stars twinkled in approval") borders on cliché, dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh locksmith-as-idea-liberator twist elevates trope, but "gnarled tree" and "ancient tradition" feel derivative. Emotional specificity falters—unlocking an abstract "idea" lacks visceral stakes. Bold risk (lyric structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
