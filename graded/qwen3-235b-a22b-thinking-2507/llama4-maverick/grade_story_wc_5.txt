<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "turmoil of emotions" is diagnostic label-speak without embodied contradiction. Final endurance (sealing plate) earns visible cost through exhaustion, but motivation remains singularly focused without internal conflict fracturing her process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("exhaustion and triumph") and reconfigures stillness as "alive with new beginnings." Orientation succeeds early, but lens ambiguity surfaces mid-scene with underdeveloped "safekept starlight" mechanics weakening causal pressure before shifting to Accumulative/Textural at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: discarded twigs/pebbles constrain pattern-weaving choices, and the plate's glow interacting with fading light charges the final image. Subarctic crater remains ornamental, but "withered orchard" decaying leaves actively shape sensory hierarchy ("morbid perfume that clung to every surface").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("translate heartbeats into maps") is declared but never tested; no obstacles beyond time pressure. Escalation lacks meaningful tightening—sealing the plate faces zero resistance despite "absolute patience" requirement. Cost remains abstract until final image, failing to charge mid-beat tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in desolation resonates through reweighted patterns ("now seemed to hold new significance"), but remains tethered to abstract "rhythm of existence" without concrete cost. Avoids moralizing, yet conceptual repricing lacks depth as the central conflict never genuinely tests the thematic premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in texture-focused lexicon ("soft crunch of gravel," "vibrated with anticipation"), with rhythmic control modulating during high-pressure sealing. Minor register drift occurs when "cartographer of the soul" metaphor overreaches character-plausible articulation during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but adjacent-line paraphrase loop: "stillness so profound it felt as though the world was holding its breath" (para 3) vs. identical phrasing later (para 5). High density maintained except for "safekept starlight" abstraction diluting closure’s concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and cartography feels fresh, with "translating heartbeats into maps" offering non-obvious emotional geometry. However, "flash-paper alchemist" title remains unearned, and subarctic crater setting lacks transformative specificity beyond generic desolation tropes.</comment>
