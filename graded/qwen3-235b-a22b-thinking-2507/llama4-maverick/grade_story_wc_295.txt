<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphanies feel unearned ("world seemed brighter") without visible cost. "Heals with words" trait remains label-only with no embodied tradeoffs during pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: Lyra's renewed purpose shows no sacrifice or altered tactics. Accumulative lens holds but "midnight solace" resolution feels unearned without concrete price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory setting vividly rendered but fails to constrain choices; variable stars function decoratively rather than altering tactics. Daylily-pressed telegram charges final image yet lacks causal pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding inscriptions) remains abstract; no meaningful tightening of options. "Shared burdens" concept informs theme but never tests commitment through on-page tradeoffs or losses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "power of shared burdens" stated explicitly in final paragraph with moralizing tone. Conceptual repricing fails as "solace" conclusion lacks conceptual cost or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV consistent with lyrical precision, but "midnight solace" repetition creates template cadence. Perceptual signature strong yet stress-induced compression absent during pivotal decoding moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose loops undermine momentum: "As [temporal phrase]..." cadence repeats 5x. Overwritten metaphors ("stars twinkle in rhythm with thoughts") blur causality without payoff in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream chronicle/variable stars feels fresh yet lacks risk; "shared burdens" trope transformed through celestial framing but resolution avoids moral complexity.</comment>
