<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via "shiver down spine" and micro-choices like prism handling, but "retrocognitively blessed" label replaces earned insight; contradictions in "shattered world" hope lack visceral friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "pavilion singing a new tune," but cost remains abstract—conceptual fragility of rebirth isn't viscerally felt in the final beat despite "shattered world" setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thistle scent and humming glass constrain choice (e.g., "breath caught" during shard touch), charging the climax; micro-setting excellence elevates atmosphere beyond decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Accumulative lens as star-path tracking intensifies sensory density, but agency is passive—"felt a surge" lacks decisive action; cost of rebirth remains conceptual, not embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "coincidences have meaning" motif, but direct statement in para 3 creates thematic echo; final "world reborn" image reweights hope without moralizing, though fragility lacks depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "facets glinting" and "sweet scent of thistle," with rhythmic control during orrery climax; no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown" repetition creates paraphrase loop; "shard of hush" appears verbatim three times. No closure-dulling artifacts, but synonym churn limits propulsion in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition and star paths feels inevitable, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure; "glass humming pavilion" avoids trope via tactile specificity and emotional weight.</comment>
