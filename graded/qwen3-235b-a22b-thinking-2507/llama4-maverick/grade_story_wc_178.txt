<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction remains abstract ("skepticism and wonder" stated but not embodied in choices); no visible cost for transformation beyond vague "frugal existence transformed" without concrete sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: "universe forever changed" is declared but no felt price paid (e.g., physical toll, lost opportunity); Earned Stasis fails as astronomer gains everything without visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Palace frescoes and tile shimmer with sensory specificity; "dusky harmony" motif charges the final image but micro-setting (tile) doesn’t constrain choices—only symbolizes abstract transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("seal covenant with unknown") remain cosmic and untested; no narrowing of options or tangible price (e.g., health, time, sanity) despite regime change pressure; escalation feels internal without external consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" theme emerges through tile imagery but collapses into final-paragraph moralizing ("beauty and order could prevail"); avoids sentimentality yet overstates cosmic impact without earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in astronomer’s cosmic focus; rhythmic control sustains tension through "liminal moment" climax; no head-hopping despite single POV intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" repetition creates paraphrase loops (3x in final 100 words); "celestial rhythms" cadence runs dull immediacy; lyrical density obscures causality in covenant "sealing" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Transforms magic square trope via Babylonian context and "empirically ironic" lens; risks lyrical abstraction but avoids gimmickry—though cosmic stakes lack fresh emotional specificity for 600-800 words.</comment>
