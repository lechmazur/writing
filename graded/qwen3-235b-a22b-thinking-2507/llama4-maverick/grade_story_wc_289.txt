<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows Lena's yearning for connection but "inevitably whimsical" trait remains label-only without concrete tradeoffs under pressure. Ghostwriting backstory informs motivation yet lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments. Final realization feels earned but cost remains abstract; no visible struggle altering tactics during the art contribution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise: Lena's paradigm shift ("thread... to be created") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost, crystallizing options through the twig's integration. Accumulative lens holds via sensory accumulation to the installation's reveal. Minor deduction as cost legibility lacks physical manifestation in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lotus temple and lily pond establish vivid atmosphere but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choices. Thrush's nest twig succeeds as micro-setting—it charges the closure image when clutched in Lena's hand—yet environmental pressure on tactics remains underdeveloped despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking connection thread) tightens via Lena's decision to contribute the twig, narrowing her passive observation into active participation. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; artists' installation happens around her without meaningful opposition. Cost is felt but not visibly altering tactics, limiting escalation impact under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the twig spiral's evolution from nest artifact to artistic symbol, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "thread" concept with conceptual cost—Lena's shift from seeker to creator—without stating a moral. Quiet resolution earns resonance through particulars, resisting false binaries about connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lena's sensory focus (scent, texture, light) sustains voice, but elevated diction ("prismatic quiet") occasionally drifts from her ghostwriter lexicon. Consistent psychic distance avoids head-hopping, though rhythmic control wavers during reflection blocks. Lyric compression serves Accumulative lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion via varied syntax, but paraphrase loops ("sweet scent of blooming flowers" repeated verbatim) and minor scaffold in reflection blocks trigger -0.3 deduction. Figurative language remains coherent, yet "whimsy that had always defined her" risks label-speak in peak beat. Final image clarity prevents higher penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic collaboration as connection metaphor feels inevitable, with specific details (thrush's nest integration) avoiding tropes. But "keeper of secrets" premise lacks transformation beyond conventional romantic ghostwriter framing. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, yet lotus temple setting borders on generic spiritual archetype.</comment>
