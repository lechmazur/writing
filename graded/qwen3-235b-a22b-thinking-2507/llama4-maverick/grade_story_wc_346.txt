<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority relies on abstract labels ("burden of bruised awe") rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure beyond mechanical adjustments, weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (enduring vigilance), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure accumulates atmospherically without narrowing options or altering tactics under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (porcelain cracks, deepening dusk) anchor setting, but lighthouse/puppet head function as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices; final shimmering pane charges image without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving time's balance) signaled early but pressure remains static; "burden" is felt yet never transforms tactics, missing the escalation requirement for 7.0+ under Accumulative lens despite coherent dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragility/beauty emerges organically through puppet head and hush motifs; final image reweights premise without moralizing, though "bruised awe" lacks sufficient earned complexity for higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with consistent perceptual signature ("pane of hush" rhythm), but stress compression fails—syntax remains uniformly ornate during climax rather than modulating with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "hush" cadence (7+ uses) and template stems ("As they worked... As the light deepened") create paraphrase loops; "burden of bruised awe" qualifies as therapy-speak in peak beat, dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday clock trope via lullaby/puppet head, but emotional specificity lacks transformative stakes; risks poetic abstraction over tangible conflict, capping originality.</comment>
