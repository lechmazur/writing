<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("overwhelming sense of purpose") without embodied contradiction; motivation remains surface-level fascination with no visible struggle against competing impulses during the library exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise at lantern window) lacks on-page cost—Kael gains revelation without forfeiture, endurance, or tactical shift; Accumulative lens holds but cost proof test fails at the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sunken ship setting creates vivid atmosphere ("scent of saltwater and decay"), but fails 9+ gate as environment never constrains choices—Kael navigates freely without resource limitations or spatial pressure affecting his pursuit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("uncover secrets") without escalation; pressure stagnates as Kael's "purposeful wandering" faces no narrowing of options or tangible complication beyond atmospheric deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "luminous vows" metaphor, but final paragraph risks thematic echo with "never see the world same way"—resonance lacks the non-literal reweighting required for Q5 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture ("meteor hush," "labyrinthine corridors"), but high-pressure beats suffer repetitive cadence ("footsteps echoing... shadows deepening... air thickening") diluting perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: stacked modifiers ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "palpable energy") create density muddle; paraphrase loops ("truth hiding behind words... look beyond surface") trigger −0.4 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric fusion of sunken library and lantern festival shows ingenuity, but "color of sound" concept feels derivative without fresh emotional calculus—fails transformation test for higher bands.</comment>
