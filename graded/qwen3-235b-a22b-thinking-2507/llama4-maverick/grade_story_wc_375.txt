<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via charcoal-stained fingers channeling suppressed emotions, but "auroral sorrow" risks diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, slightly undermining embodied authenticity despite strong micro-choices with the lock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure as transformed lock crystallizes creative rebirth, but cost remains abstract ("weight begin to lift") without concrete on-page forfeiture; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal cave functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—humming vibrations channel emotions into strokes and charge the final lock transformation, avoiding postcard description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative blockage) tightens via protagonist's agency when turning dials sparks creation, but escalation lacks visible price; emotional resolution feels earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through portrait-weaving mechanics and crystalline resonance, but final repetition of "inescapable callings" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity in the closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "charcoal-fingered" details and crystalline synesthesia; rhythmic control under pressure evident in "bold and expressive" stroke descriptions, with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "auroral sorrow" repetition and mixed metaphor ("slow uncorking of a bottle") create subtle momentum drag, but high density in sketching sequence prevents closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic struggle through mnemonic portraiture in resonant cave setting, but "auroral sorrow" phrasing leans toward familiar lyrical tropes without sufficient transformation for higher-band risk distinction.</comment>
