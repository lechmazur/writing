<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation clear but lacks interior contradiction; Aria's choice to delve deeper shows micro-choice under pressure yet remains emotionally abstract without embodied conflict. Pilgrim serves as plot device with no relationship dynamics or status shifts. No visible cost scales to length, and "curiosity was piqued" typifies label-only interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("changed her" implies humbling transformation), but cost legibility falters—no exact sentence crystallizes the price. Orientation anchors by 120 words, and Accumulative lens holds through density increase in sensory escalation. Missing one tightening that forecloses a path with tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly rendered with musical crystals and vibrations, yet functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice; final beacon image lacks causal ties to cave specifics. Micro-setting potential in the pearl isn't leveraged for environmental pressure. Selective sensory details reflect urgency but miss opportunities to mirror internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnifying unseen forces) signaled early, with one deepening beat as Aria's senses heighten, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options. Cost remains conceptual ("changed her") without visceral legibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens yet misses band guardrail requiring visible price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cave vibrations and pearl's energy, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's explicit statement: "magic was not something extraordinary." This thematic echo triggers −0.6 penalty, undermining earned resonance. Central question reweights via Aria's realization but loses nuance to direct explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (vibrational attunement) and rhythmic control matching mystical tone; stress compresses diction without voice leakage. Pilgrim's dialogue feels natural yet sparse, avoiding character convergence. No head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold, though "bright darkness" risks mixed metaphor without payoff. Final line ("waiting to be magnified and shared") leans cliché but avoids thematic echo penalties here. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and no paraphrase loops dull momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Transforms clairvoyant trope through specific musical cave mechanics and focus on everyday magic, yet premise remains familiar. Emotional truth in Aria's humility elevates, but avoids bold risk-taking; "bright darkness" tone deepens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative safety middle prevents higher band entry.</comment>
