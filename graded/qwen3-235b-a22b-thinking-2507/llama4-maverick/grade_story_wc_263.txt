<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("doubts and fears" vs. "newfound sureness") emerges late; embodied emotion remains abstract ("weight lifting like tide") without visceral physicality during pivotal tracing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as creativity barriers dissolve, but cost remains conceptual ("mist evaporating") without concrete forfeiture; Accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks sufficient pressure buildup before the dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Astrolabe functions as micro-setting charging closure ("tool for unlocking imagination"), though aurora archway remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices beyond illumination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("free trapped creativity") tightens through tracing falling stars, but pressure lacks visible cost escalation; dissolution feels unearned as doubts never manifest in concrete failed attempts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>7.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through stardust/astrolabe recurrence, but "universe always speaking" final line veers toward thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual repricing depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("celestial ballet," "shadowed rapture") modulates with emotional intensity, though lyrical compression occasionally strains plausibility ("throne of the universe resonating").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt the weight lifting," "knew rest was essential"); stock metaphors ("wings of pure enchantment") dilute closure image despite otherwise rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical ritual with creativity blockage, though "moonstruck dreamer" archetype lacks sufficient transformation from familiar tropes despite lyrical execution.</comment>
