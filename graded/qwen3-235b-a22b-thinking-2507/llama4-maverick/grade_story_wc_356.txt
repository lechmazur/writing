<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; Lyra's serenity lacks struggle against ambition. Epiphany about wisdom being "always present" feels unearned without prior conflict. Diagnostic label-speak ("cultivating serenity within motion") triggers penalty. No visible cost to her change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds (Elyria established by para 1), but closure lacks legible cost. "Impact was lasting" tells rather than shows consequence; final image of flourishing spirit reads as soft reset. Cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence evidencing price paid for wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Treetop village described vividly but never pressures choices (e.g., height irrelevant to corpse flower growth). Micro-setting like bare feet or stained fingers lacks causal role. Final image’s "wildflower hush" echoes earlier description without reweighting meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>No coherent pressure: "stake" of unlocking wisdom faces zero opposition. Tide’s turning is vague, not a live clock tightening decisions. Blooming occurs passively—no protagonist-driven escalation or trade-off. Agency reduced to tending seed without meaningful choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph states moral ("cultivating serenity within motion") verbatim, violating organic emergence rule. Wisdom’s "impact" told not shown; corpse flower’s role remains symbolic convenience. Closure offers no resonant answer to central question—just affirmation of premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Uniform "Lyra felt..." cadence creates drumbeat rhythm; no perceptual signature in sensory selection (e.g., olfactory sensitivity unused in descriptions). Under blooming stress, prose remains ornate without compression. Voice lacks distinct texture beneath lyrical surface.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Severe template cadence: "Lyra felt..." opens 5+ sentences in climax. Filter-verb stack ("felt surge... felt senses expand... felt serenity wash") in high-pressure beat triggers -0.5 penalty. Final line overwritten: "wildflower hush that echoed through the trees" drowns specificity in abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Trope-heavy execution: mystical seed, instant enlightenment, wise vendor. "Undercurrent of wisdom" concept generic; no fresh inflection on magical realism. Transformation test fails—plot works unchanged if Elyria became desert village. Relies on safety middle (serene resolution).</comment>
