<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction absent; "sense of peace" abstract without embodied conflict. No micro-choices under pressure despite knotting ritual. "Esoteric realist" trait told not shown through specific behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (structures as testament) lacks legible cost; "glowing" moth wing feels symbolic not earned. Accumulative lens holds but final image doesn't reweight fragility with undeniable pressure. No sentence makes cost visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto's sensory details vivid but static; no environmental constraint on choices. Moth wing (micro-setting) charges closure but arrives too late to shape mid-scene tactics. Misses 9+ gate by not altering Aria's actions earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled but no escalation; knotting/building feels repetitive not deepening. No narrowing of options or trade-off—fragility stated but not dramatized through specific cost. Band guardrail fails: price doesn't charge final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but theme remains abstract; "overlooked histories" lacks concrete embodiment. Final image offers quiet resonance but no non-literal answer reweighting prior material. Earned wisdom diluted by generic "power of human spirit" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "blushing stillness" and insect cadence. Rhythmic control strong but stress flattens syntax ("Aria felt... Aria felt..."). No head-hopping; voice consistent though peak-beat compression undercuts pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack in closure beat ("felt a sense of peace... felt connection") dulls immediacy. Template cadence ("fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful") repeats in high-pressure moment. Final paragraph paraphrase loop obscures earned cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ephemeral art honoring histories is familiar trope; "last monarch butterfly" adds freshness but not leveraged for specific emotional calculus. Avoids derivative pitfalls yet lacks bold risk-taking—safety middle in "transience" theme.</comment>
