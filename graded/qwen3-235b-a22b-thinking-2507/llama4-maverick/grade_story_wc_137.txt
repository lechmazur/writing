<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emilia's "courageously kind determination" feels like a label rather than embodied contradiction; her skepticism evaporates too readily when handling the tile, missing opportunities for internal tension during transcription. No visible cost anchors her change beyond abstract "peace."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (tile's work "done," memories "given a voice") with conceptual cost—the entangled memories' permanence resonates through the whale song. But the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks meaningful escalation; transcription proceeds smoothly without pressure shifts or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower’s latticework actively constrains choices (wind disrupting focus), while the whale migration tightens temporal stakes—Emilia must transcribe before the songs fade. Final image of "wind whispering through latticework" charges closure by mirroring the "unheard symphony," making setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking entangled memories) is clear early but never tightens—no obstacles or trade-offs during transcription. The cost ("peace settling over the tower") is felt but abstract; lacks visceral price like physical exhaustion or sacrificed time that would charge the final image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tile/whale-song symbiosis: hidden patterns govern reality. Final image ("whales... sang their song, a reminder of hidden patterns") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. But "courageously kind heart" edges toward thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sea-tuned details ("melody harmonized with patterns on the tile"), but peak moments lapse into abstract lyricism ("alchemy of memory transformed the mundane"). Whale song’s "unheard symphony" motif sustains voice consistency without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose flows lyrically but overwrites key beats: "unexpected surge of courageously kind determination" uses label-speak where embodied detail (shaking hands, steadying breath) would heighten pressure. Template cadence ("As she..., she felt...") recurs in transcription scenes, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tropes (magic tile, whale mysticism) feel familiar without fresh inflection—the tile’s mechanics remain vague, and the resolution follows predictable mystical discovery patterns. Avoids genericity through specific tower/seascape textures, but lacks bold risk-taking to transform expectations.</comment>
