<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "interlaced absence" without embodied contradiction; "archeologist of abandoned dreams" motivation told not shown through micro-choices under pressure. No visible flaws complicate decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative vs Hybrid), capping score despite valid Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "hushed blaze" metaphor but lens instability undermines escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion described vividly but static; fails to constrain choices or charge final image. Micro-setting potential of inkwell underutilized despite recurring presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) clear but pressure never escalates; surveyor works undisturbed. No tightening of options or trade-offs, violating 8.0+ band guardrail requiring foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes ("beauty in absence... guiding light") triggering -0.6 Thematic Echo penalty. Theme stated not earned through action; "interlaced absence" remains abstract concept without visceral cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice marred by register drift: "interlaced absence" sounds academic mid-task. Tics like "hushed blaze" recur without stress modulation, flattening peak-beat texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Closure beat contains paraphrase loop: "left behind, a testament to interlaced absence" echoes earlier "testament to power of interlaced absence." Template cadence in surveyor's actions dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Familiar preservation theme lacks fresh inflection; inkwell symbol feels conventional. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.8) as emotional arc works unchanged with different artifact.</comment>
