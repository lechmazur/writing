<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("cultivate foresight") remains abstract despite clear interiority; lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Final "clarity" shows growth but no visible cost or earned change, missing Q1 9+ requirement for conflicted impulses and tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("secrets would stay with her") reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual without unmistakable on-page dramatization. Orientation succeeds early, yet cost proof test fails—no specific image conveys sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (narrow alleys, wind patterns) and charge the final image ("labyrinth receding... secrets stay with her"). Sensory details like "creaking containers" and rust/saltwater smells serve urgency, passing Q3 9+ gate through environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through wind pattern observations, showing protagonist agency, but lack tangible cost. Pressure builds via "rapidly adapting" phenomena, yet no trade-off alters tactics—cost stays abstract despite escalation under Accumulative lens, failing Q4 9+ requirement for unmistakable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the patch’s evolving symbolism ("more than emblem... crew’s response"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the labyrinth from intimidating to "secrets laid bare," offering non-literal answer to understanding tragedy without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in professional details ("documenting wind patterns"), with syntax tightening under stress. Consistent focalization avoids filter-verb stacks, though minor cadence repetition ("she felt... she realized") slightly dulls peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythm but scaffold issues: "silence was oppressive... silence seemed to press in" creates paraphrase loop. Template cadence in survey sequence ("pulled out... began to survey... noticed") mildly dulls immediacy, though final line avoids cliché with "hazy precision."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle in using wind patterns to explore crisis response, transforming "labyrinth" trope through specific observation. Emotional truth in quiet determination avoids sentimentality, but "lone investigator in eerie setting" premise lacks deeper innovation to reach 9+ band.</comment>
