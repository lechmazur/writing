<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation to unlock mirror secrets but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; calmness never wavers despite high stakes, reducing embodied struggle. "Perceptively calm" label repeats without showing cost (e.g., no fatigue during breakthrough).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes options as mirrors clear to show "glimpses of worlds," but cost proof fails—no on-page consequence for borrowed heartbeat or success. Bells tolling drives escalation under Accumulative lens, yet breakthrough feels coincidental, not earned by agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid prism/mirror imagery creates strong atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices (e.g., rain dissipated early, terrace unused physically). Micro-setting potential in "borrowed heartbeat" ignored; final glow charges image without tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (unlocking mirror possibilities) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—pressure comes from external bells/mirrors, not her choices. Tightening occurs via lullaby mechanics, yet "surge of excitement" feels unearned; cost remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of "possibilities beyond reality" emerges organically through prism/mirror motifs, but avoids concrete cost—no tradeoff for success (e.g., sanity, energy). Final image resonates yet lacks conceptual repricing; "borrowed heartbeat" remains abstract, not reweighted by closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky harmony," "kaleidoscope of colors") with rhythmic control, but minor POV leaks ("mirrors seemed to stir" unfiltered through her senses). "Perceptively calm" label disrupts interiority; no dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sensory prose marred by climax artifacts: "colors dancing" → "colors swirling" synonym loop and "borrowed heartbeat" repetition dull momentum. Stacked modifiers in "dusky harmony that seemed to pulse" risk muddle; final beat lacks zero-loop rigor for 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-as-visionary trope with coded lullaby mechanic, but prism parapet feels ornamental. Emotional specificity in "children's song" elevates, yet core premise lacks transformative risk—mirrors responding requires no genuine struggle or cost.</comment>
