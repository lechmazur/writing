<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("sense of purpose," "oppressive stillness") without embodied contradiction; warden's motivation to "expunge pain" lacks visible struggle against countervailing impulses, rendering micro-choices like photographing decay as rote repetition rather than value-driven trade-offs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (silence "vibrating with promise" crystallizing the narrative mission), but conceptual cost of memory's burden feels implied rather than legible in a specific image; Accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks density increase beyond atmospheric thickening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details ("morbid perfume of damp earth," wind chime's silence) vividly anchor the resurfaced town; the sapphire label evolves from found object to closure-charging beacon, meeting 9+ gate by constraining the warden's symbolic connection to the past.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing through narrative) remains abstractly declared without visceral escalation; pressure never tightens options or forces trade-offs—the warden's unwavering resolve eliminates meaningful friction between "expunging pain" and confronting memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-healing emerges organically through photographic "threads" and the liqueur label's reprise; avoids moralizing by letting the final image ("silence vibrating with promise") resonate as a non-literal answer to communal loss without stated wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal remains," "mirrored hush") filters decay through the warden's purposeful lens; rhythmic control sustains contemplative tension without elision issues, though stress-induced compression under stillness lacks physiological specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose avoids scaffold but over-relies on elevated abstractions ("precisely humane touch," "resonant reconfiguration"); minor density issues in reflective passages dilute momentum, though no closure-obscuring artifacts mar the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes familiar tropes (haunted town, memory work) through fresh specifics like the sapphire label's glow; emotional truth in quiet perseverance avoids generic templates, though risk-taking remains constrained by safe middle-ground pacing.</comment>
