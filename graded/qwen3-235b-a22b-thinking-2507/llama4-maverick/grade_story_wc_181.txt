<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("disquiet") without embodied contradiction; breakthrough occurs without struggle or visible cost. No contradictory impulses during pivotal bathroom scene undermines motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (irreversible worldview shift), but escalation lacks meaningful density increase under Accumulative lens. Humming-to-figures sequence feels like linear progression rather than pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (stardust blossoms, incense-thick air) create atmosphere, but setting remains decorative. Astral orchard fails to constrain choices or charge closure beyond symbolic resonance despite final blooming imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("forbidden knowledge") remain abstractly declared with no on-page test. Robed figures facilitate rather than oppose; breakthrough occurs without resistance or tactical consequence, violating Accumulative escalation requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges through stone/book, but "having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms was not something the curator was accustomed to" triggers thematic echo penalty. Final orchard image provides resonance without earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits lyrical consistency but generic phrasing ("brightened disquiet", "mind expanding") lacks character-particular perceptual signature. Under stress, curator maintains unnaturally calm, articulate interiority without degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("began to feel", "experienced a realization") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final-third genericism ("teeming with life and possibility") triggers -0.3 artifact penalty without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise (astral orchard on asteroid) elevated by pistachio cameo specificity, but bathroom epiphany trope execution feels derivative. Transformation test fails when names/places altered; emotional specificity lacks depth.</comment>
