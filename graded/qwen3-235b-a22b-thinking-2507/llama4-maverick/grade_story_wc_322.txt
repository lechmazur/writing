<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Architect's motivation ("texture of connection") lacks contradictory impulses; emotions remain abstract ("unsettling calm") without embodied struggle. Final departure shows no earned cost or visible trade-off, reducing closure impact despite coherent interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure. Cost ("memories altering") is legible but feels conceptual rather than visceral, weakening final stakes despite strong pattern escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sinew thread functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (guiding movement/weaving) and charges the final image ("ghostly umbilical cord"), satisfying 9+ gate through tangible object integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via sensory intensification under Accumulative lens, but protagonist's passivity ("wove patterns" as observation, not choice) undermines agency. Cost (memory alteration) lacks concrete consequence for tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through gallery physics-bending; final image ("world vibrating with tension") reweights "rational enchantment" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of old glass," thread's "pulse") with rhythmic control during eruption sequence. Elision of memory shifts taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "memories began to alter, shifting and reforming like a living thing" achieve triple duty (action/image/theme). No figurative muddle even in high-pressure climax beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" premise transformed via architect's thread-weaving logic; specificity passes transformation test (swap "architect" for "painter" breaks causality). Lacks one bold risk to reach 9.0+.</comment>
