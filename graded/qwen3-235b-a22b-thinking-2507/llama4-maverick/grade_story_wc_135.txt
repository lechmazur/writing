<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to heal is clear but interiority relies on abstract labels ("sense of absence") without embodied contradiction; tidy resolution lacks irrational struggle under pressure despite earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt: harbor setting unclear past 120 words ("ivory harbor" undefined), triggering -0.4 penalty; accumulative lens holds but disorientation doesn't charge closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (trumpet valve) charges final image as "symbol of resilience," but harbor atmosphere remains postcard backdrop without constraining choices like spatial choreography during installations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (community healing) viscerally felt through "void" and exile's devastation, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; installations execute plan without tactical adaptation under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through valve's reweighted meaning, but final paragraph's "testament to the power of remembrance" triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artifact observation, but emotional peaks use clinical labels ("reactively visionary") violating POV lexicon; no head-hopping but stress response lacks syntactic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("compile fragments," "disparate elements") and template cadence ("She felt... She purchased...") dull momentum; closure beat's "testament to remembrance" is therapy-speak label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle in "ocean-spray archivist" profession, but emotional arc follows predictable healing template without bold risk; ivory harbor specificity elevates generic premise.</comment>
