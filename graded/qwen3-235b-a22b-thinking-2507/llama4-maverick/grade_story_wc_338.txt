<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; motivation ("interpret silence with empathy") remains abstract label without embodied trade-offs. No visible struggle between curiosity and fear during pivotal analysis, rendering closure choice unmotivated despite strong sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words (no temporal anchor beyond "rainy day"); closure lacks legible cost—peaceful resolution ("found a piece of herself") contradicts Accumulative lens requiring density shift with felt consequence. Rain's role as pressure source remains passive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with mold/damp earth sensory specificity, but rain-scoured vault never constrains choices—merely backdrop. Micro-setting (map tear) charged final image weakly; cost cap at 8.8 applies as no object/tool actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover henge secrets) never tightens; "subtle patterns" reveal no concrete cost or narrowed options. Agency passive—discoveries "began to yield"—undermining Accumulative escalation. Rain’s pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo destroys resonance: final paragraph’s "world full of secrets... ready to listen" states moral outright. Epiphany ("mysteries hidden in plain sight") feels unearned, lacking integration with Elara’s map-framer specificity or tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV consistent but over-reliant on filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature weak—professional cartography lens rarely shapes sensory selection beyond generic "creases and tears." Voice converges during stress into abstract awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Severe filter-verb stacks in climax ("felt shiver... felt focus deepen... felt awe") obscure causality. Template cadence in final paragraph ("felt sense of... felt reverence... felt peace") triggers -0.5 penalty. Closure image blurred by overwriting ("soothing melody," "siren call").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Map-framer premise feels derivative of "sensitive archaeologist" tropes. Rain/henge setting lacks fresh inflection—no specific cultural or technical details transform familiar mystery framework. Emotional resolution avoids risk with generic wonder.</comment>
