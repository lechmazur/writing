<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "morbid fascination" and "filtered differently" without embodied contradiction; zero visible cost to the survivor's obsession beyond vague "ghostly figure" description. Diagnostic label-speak ("texture of memories") triggers automatic penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "sense of clarity emerged," but cost remains abstract ("time was always in motion") rather than visceral; poison bottle label’s final reappearance charges the image yet lacks tangible consequence. Lens (Accumulative) holds cleanly through tidal rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Containers function as micro-setting through repeated label imagery, but sensory detail is thin (only visual/tidal sounds); fails 9+ gate as environment never constrains a choice—e.g., no physical hindrance during "weaving" moments despite labyrinthine scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering erased histories) lack escalation—no narrowing of options or visible price paid. Survivor’s "nameless identity" implies cost but remains undramatized; static pressure ("continued to layer") violates 8.8+ requirement for "visible price charging final image."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through poison bottle label’s reweighting (curiosity → symbol → relic), avoiding moralizing. Nearly fails in final lines with "testament to power of memory," but CR closure ("whispers... waiting") rescues it by charging prior material non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV consistency is strong, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—"texture of memories" is generic abstraction. Under stress, no rhythmic compression; lyrical cadence remains uniform ("footsteps echoed... rhythm of tides") dulling pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Template cadence cripples momentum: three consecutive "Their [noun] [verb]" openings ("eyes scanned... gaze lingered... mind wandered"). Paraphrase loop in "reconstruct erased histories... rediscover texture of memories" bloats key beats without added pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory recovery via container labyrinth, but safety-middle hedging: "port city" lacks verifiable detail, and "death certificate error survivor" feels tropey without specific grounding. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens coherence yet avoids bold stakes.</comment>
