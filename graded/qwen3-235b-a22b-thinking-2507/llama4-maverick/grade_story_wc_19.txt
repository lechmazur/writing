<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Diagnostic label "claustrophobia" in climax ("had not vanished") violates embodied emotion rule; micro-choices like doll release show credible contradiction but therapeutic phrasing undercuts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "claustrophobia not vanished" crystallizes cost with tangible doll; Accumulative lens holds as silence flavors deepen stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Trellis atmosphere vivid but fails 9+ gate; environment doesn't constrain choices (open space contradicts claustrophobia conflict), final image charged by doll not setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Eli's agency (releasing doll, focusing) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "no longer dominant force" with visible psychological tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silence-flavor motif without moralizing; final image reweights journey via porcelain doll as earned non-literal answer to fear/confinement question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory cataloging ("snow falling on frozen lake"); rhythmic control sustains lyrical compression through gravity inversion climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" creates mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat (climax description), dulling closure image per Q7 artifact rules despite otherwise precise prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia and inverted gravity; specific "silence flavors" transform trope through sensory stakes, avoiding abstraction with porcelain doll's irreplaceable role.</comment>
