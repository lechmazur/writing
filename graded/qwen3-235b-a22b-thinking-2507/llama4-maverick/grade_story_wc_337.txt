<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("lucid unrest") without embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure during knot-unraveling. Motivation to "ground spirits" remains told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("silence she accumulated" as "gentle disturbance"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact sentence shows sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds, yet orientation anchors (prism sanctuary's rules) lack clarity past 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's starlight actively constrains the restorer's work (kaleidoscope colors on hands) and charges the final image ("beacon of peace"). Recurring tapestry needle evolves from tool to symbol, directly shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: spirits stir but offer zero resistance, no narrowing of options or trade-offs during unraveling. Dominant stake ("ground spirits") lacks on-page cost until closure, failing "pressure grows" requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as balm emerges through "interlaced hush" accumulation, but final paragraph moralizes ("power of silence and the restorer's art"), triggering -0.6 thematic echo penalty. Non-literal answer to central question remains muddled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of the past," "velvety stillness") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control peaks in closure ("starlight faded, but..."). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "interlaced hush" pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "kaleidoscope of colors across the restorer's hands" exemplifies high-density textural propulsion. Only minor risk: "velvety stillness" slightly borders on purple prose but stays voice-motivated in context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of restorer/spirit-grounding via net-unraveling feels inevitable, but avoids bold risk—relies on familiar "art as healing" trope without transformation. Specific prism sanctuary details elevate, yet emotional truth lacks grit.</comment>
