<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to "merge parallel timelines" remains abstract cosmic aspiration without personal stakes or contradictory impulses; resilience is stated but not embodied through trade-offs. No visible cost or earned change despite "trepidation" lip service.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation fails: location/time unclear past 120 words with no disorientation payoff. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lacks legible cost—"shifting world" feels weightless without constraint shaping her step. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) undermines escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Grotto descriptions are vivid but ornamental; starlight/hourglass never constrain choices. Micro-setting potential wasted—dripping water/minerals noted but don’t alter tactics. Fails 9+ gate: no environment/tool charging final image beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No pressure escalation: vanishing ferry investigation costs Elara nothing (no time risk, sacrificed priorities). Marcus’ "be careful" is weak opposition. Stakes remain abstract—"cosmic balance" never viscerally tested. Agency passive; discovery happens effortlessly without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme ("merge timelines for cosmic balance") stated as prompt-like abstraction, not emergent from struggle. Final "permanent transient-ness" is jargon-y thematic echo. Avoids complexity—no wrong characters or meaningful ambiguity—reducing resonance to generic wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical but lacks stress-modulated compression; filter verbs ("Elara felt...") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Marcus’ dialogue functional but indistinct from narration. Perceptual signature absent—observations read touristy, not deckhand-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heavy scaffold: "voice steady and reassuring as she reported" tells emotion already shown. Template cadence ("As she walked...") in discovery beat. Final paragraph’s "shifting, flowing... ride the tide" is purple prose diluting closure. Filter-verb stack disallows 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Trope-heavy execution: "equinox ghost ship" and "ancient markings deciphered" lack fresh inflection. Emotional truth generic—no specificity in why Elara cares beyond cosmic clichés. Derivative premise without transformation through lived detail; safety-middle hedging.</comment>
