<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("witness without judgment") remains abstract with no dramatized conflict; keeper's "loose grip on reality" is label-only with zero tradeoffs tested under pressure. No micro-choices reveal values—only passive observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "crumbling peace" ending offers no visible consequence for burrowing deeper. Accumulative lens holds but regenerative silence lacks felt price—closure reads as thematic echo, not reconfiguration with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: catacombs' "scent of aged parchment" and "crumbling peace" tone permeate action. Obsidian refuge constrains choice by drawing keeper deeper—environment charges the final image of "whispers of the earth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("soul worn weary by time") stay abstract with no on-page test. Burrowing action lacks escalation—it merely continues without narrowing options or altering tactics. Dominant stake signaled but never concretized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "crumbling peace" motif, but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to regenerative power of silence"). Avoids sentimentality yet over-explains stakes; earns resonance via "fragile beauty of transience" imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct: keeper's "cryptic folds" perception shapes diction ("veins of crystal whispered secrets"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via origami swan metaphors. Tension in "reality unravel" phrasing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "silence enveloping like a shroud" followed by "silence deepened" creates paraphrase loop. Strong verbs ("burrow," "unravel") but redundant "crumbling peace" repetitions dull closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-archaeologist mystic avoids stock tropes. "Origami swan divination" transforms cataloging into tactile ritual, but "regenerative silence" concept feels derivative without specific cost demonstration.</comment>
