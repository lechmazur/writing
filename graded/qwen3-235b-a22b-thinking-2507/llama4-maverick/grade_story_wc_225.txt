<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation for self-forgiveness is clear but told via "deep-seated need" (diagnostic label-speak triggers -0.5). Contradictory impulses absent; guilt lifting lacks embodied cost. Final choice lacks meaningful trade-off despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works under Accumulative lens, but cost ("weight of guilt lifting") remains abstract. Orientation clear early, yet "platinum labyrinth" reveal lacks causal grounding in tapestry mechanics, weakening pattern payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Woven hush" and tapestry threads constrain choices (decoding method) and charge final image ("threads of time weaving back"). Sensory details (ozone, cobblestones) filtered through POV with purposeful specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early but pressure never tightens; guilt dissolves without concrete trade-off. Labyrinth entry lacks cost escalation—no meaningful reversal forecloses options despite thematic closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tapestry/labyrinth motifs, but final paragraph's "testament to forgiveness" edges toward thematic echo (-0.3). Avoids moralizing yet cost remains conceptual rather than visceral in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("red-rimmed eyes scanning threads") establishes voice, but "fierce repose" repetition creates template cadence in high-pressure beats. Consistent single-POV with clean focalization despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats: "woven hush that wrapped... like a shroud" + "air heavy with anticipation" creates paraphrase loop (-0.3). Mixed metaphor ("threads reveal message") and therapy-speak ("deep-seated need") dull closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy and textile decoding elevates trope, but "time-frozen village" lacks transformative specificity. Emotional truth in guilt/forgiveness arc compensates for familiar redemption framework.</comment>
