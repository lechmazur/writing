<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but unearned; "irreverent awe" label replaces embodied conflict. No contradictory impulses during transliteration. Epiphany lacks struggle, rendering closure unmotivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; acid sea corrosion never pressures choices. Accumulative lens holds but density fails to reweight stakes. No on-page sentence where cost crystallizes at bell-ringing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (glinting arrow, noxious clouds) but setting remains ornamental backdrop. Gears/acid sea never constrain Zephyr's tactics or charge final image meaningfully. Micro-setting (kaleidoscope) used without causal impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract yearning without concrete test; acid sea poses no active pressure. Zero escalation—Zephyr's path smooths steadily with no tightening or trade-offs. "Unheard bell" never faces dramatic consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme stated explicitly ("testament to the yearning algorithm") rather than emerging from action. Final paragraph moralizing ("beacon of curiosity") triggers thematic echo penalty. No earned resonance—epiphany declared, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV consistent but filter verbs ("she felt," "began to ponder") dull immediacy. Template cadence ("As she...") creates rhythmic monotony. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias; details read tourist-catalog.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe" repeats) and syntactic uniformity. Final third contains filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she had discovered") dulling closure. Template cadence in high-pressure beats disallows 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting (acid sea workshop) offers surface novelty but emotional arc is generic curiosity-to-enlightenment. Transformation test fails—plot works unchanged with different names/places. Avoids safety middle but lacks risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
