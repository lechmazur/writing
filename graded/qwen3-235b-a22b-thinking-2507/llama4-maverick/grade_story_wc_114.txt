<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (fever fog lifting into clarity) and embodied emotion strong, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal logbook smudging; "auroral sorrow" feels diagnostic rather than earned through embodied struggle at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("truths provisional and ephemeral"), but Accumulative/Textural escalation lacks decisive intensification—logbook note accumulation shows density without meaningful pressure shift; one non-closure issue caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (ozone, metal grating) anchor atmosphere vividly, yet the mountain station remains postcard backdrop without constraining choices; botanical illustration charges the final image but micro-setting (logbook) alone can't elevate beyond mid-band without environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("swallowed truth") stays abstract despite early signaling; zero escalation under Accumulative lens—no tightening, deepening, or cadence shift narrows options as station inhabitants merely "grow accustomed," leaving conflict static and stakes untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through botanical illustration's reprise and "margins held the key" resonance, but Q4's static conflict caps score per cross-cap rule; avoids moralizing yet lacks earned weight as abstract stakes never viscerally materialize in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (data streams filtered through oracle's precision), with rhythmic control sustaining lyrical compression; minor register drift in "auroral sorrow" repetitions slightly dulls pressure during fever-break clarity moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("charcoal drawing" vanishing), but abstract phrases like "weight of swallowed truth" recur without concrete embodiment in high-pressure beats, creating subtle scaffold loops that dilute momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fault-tolerant oracle in weather station avoids tropes through specific logbook method, yet "provisional truths" theme feels familiar; emotional specificity elevates but lacks the risk-taking required for higher-band distinction.</comment>
