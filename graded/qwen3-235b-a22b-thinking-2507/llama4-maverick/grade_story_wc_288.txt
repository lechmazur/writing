<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation lacks friction; "translate isolation into independence" remains abstract without concrete trade-offs tested on-page. Flaws don't compound choices—reincarnation memory informs but doesn't alter her sundial work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (coalescing understanding) with conceptual cost in "fragility" theme, but cost legibility falters—no specific on-page sentence where sacrifice crystallizes beyond vague "weight lifting." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal library functions as micro-setting: stone circle hum constrains Lyra's process ("coaxing secrets by the hum") and charges final image. Misses 9-band gate—environment doesn't physically alter tactics (e.g., no cloud-shift disrupting work).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving past/forging future) signaled early but pressure never escalates beyond internal reflection. No meaningful tightening—sundial remains static object, no complication tests her resolve. Cost feels conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" theme emerges organically but over-explained: "fragility of existence became starkly apparent, like shattering glass" (labeling) followed by redundant "moments of clarity that shattered complacency," diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("musty scent of aged parchment," "atomically reflective surface") modulates with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("reincarnation memory that had surfaced") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Synonym loops weaken momentum: "fragility of existence became starkly apparent, like shattering glass" then "brittle awakenings that had driven her thus far." Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra's thoughts were consumed," "Lyra's mind still reeling") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library/stone circle hum avoids genre clichés, but "reincarnated as great auk contemporary" feels derivative (cf. mythic eco-fiction tropes). Specific brass sundial details elevate, though premise lacks bold risk-taking.</comment>
