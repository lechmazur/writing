<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Luna's motivation as artist-scientist is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "affectionate skepticism" remains stated not demonstrated. Diagnostic terms like "somatic markers" undermine embodied emotion during pivotal meditation. No visible struggle with telepathy pill risks despite stated intimidation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (dawn realization), but cost remains abstract—"catalyst" phrasing avoids felt sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, yet the static shock's "recalibration" feels coincidental not earned. Missing tangible price paid for new creative path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Studio anchors with vivid linseed oil/turpentine textures, but environment never pressures choices; light sources merely enable dancing. Geode sliver functions as micro-setting charging final image, yet spatial choreography ("dancing between light sources") lacks constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking creativity) tightens through sensory deepening, but escalation falters—static shock resolves tension too cleanly. Cost remains conceptual ("catalyst" narrative) not visceral; no visible price altering Luna's actions despite recalled pill risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of art-science unity emerges through fractal light paintings, avoiding moralizing. Final "fractally precise representation" reweights geode's meaning, yet "willowglass hope" lacks earned complexity—cost feels minimized by "catalyst" framing rather than deepened.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct artist-scientist voice shines in texture/color perception ("jumble of colors and textures"), but clinical terms ("somatic markers") disrupt immersion. Rhythmic control under meditation succeeds, though "affectionate skepticism" reads as prompt insertion not organic trait.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("fascinated and intimidated... Despite risks") creates synonym loop. Strong verbs ("muscovite geode sliver glittered") offset slight purple prose ("sea of mental images"). Final "peace settle over her" edges toward sentimentality without earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" offers fresh emotional specificity, but geode-as-magic-tool trope lacks transformation. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure works, yet telepathy pill recall feels derivative—fails proximity check against common "substance-fueled creativity" narratives.</comment>
