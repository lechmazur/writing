<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("heart pounding gently" while studying pattern) and micro-choice (kneeling despite seeing figure). "Graft new meaning" motivation stays abstract; viral confession backstory lacks concrete impact on present choices beyond seeking solace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "raw edges" soothed by flower exchange crystallizes stance shift ("not alone"). Orientation clear by line 3 ("serene landscape"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) until midpoint slightly undermines escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting constraint succeeds: icicle pattern directly triggers pivotal kneeling moment and meeting. Abandoned servers feel ornamental; moss garden's "soft earth" pressures walking but lacks deeper tactical integration beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly when stranger appears ("flutter in chest" escalating to vulnerable acceptance). "Graft new meaning" motivation lacks sufficient friction—no concrete test of competing desires during the flower exchange beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "protected vulnerability" crystallized by pendant's reweighted meaning ("reminder of pain" → "strength in vulnerability"). Final image ("beacon of hope") resonates without moralizing, recharging honeyed hush with earned conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("honeyed hush," "rusting frames overgrown with vines") modulates with emotional intensity. "Graft new meaning" slips into therapy-speak, momentarily breaking POV plausibility during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle; "amber pendant glinting" offers crystalline specificity. Minor paraphrase loop in "Aria felt... yet she was determined" slightly dulls propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete image ("spirit freer").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "healing garden" trope via tech decay imagery ("thawing icicle patterns" on server ruins). "Confession went viral" premise feels template-derived; emotional specificity in pendant's reweighting provides authentic freshness.</comment>
