<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("give rest a permanent address") is concrete but the "inexplicable pull" weakens causality early; embodied weariness shines in submersion sequence where preparation labor replaces abstract longing with physical stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: the undertaker's endurance as guardian forecloses his old life with visible cost ("Years passed"), crystallizing stillness as tangible sanctuary; minor deduction for near-moralizing in "path to serenity" muddying the final image's purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens constrains choice during repair (micro-setting pressure) and charges the final image through its reactivation; "icy waters" and "dusty tomes" offer vivid specificity but lack consistent sensory narrowing during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving rest a "permanent address") tightens through lens repair, but physical obstacles (currents, darkness) remain underdeveloped pressure points; cost lands late with "years passed" rather than through immediate, felt tradeoffs during the pivotal repair beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the library's transformation into a "beacon," avoiding moralizing; the final pulse reweights "distress signal" as invitation without stating a moral, though "chased stillness" risks slight abstraction in early passages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frayed twine" and "luminescent creatures" reveals the undertaker's occupation-tuned attention; minor register drift in "inexplicable pull" momentarily fractures voice during high-pressure decision-making.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("descended," "navigated," "resembled") but "inexplicable pull" introduces therapy-speak in a pivotal beat; recurring "stillness" motif risks redundancy though redeemed by final image specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker/restoration tropes through underwater library setting; "distress signal as sanctuary" twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious, though aquatic library premise risks familiarity without deeper mythic grounding.</comment>
