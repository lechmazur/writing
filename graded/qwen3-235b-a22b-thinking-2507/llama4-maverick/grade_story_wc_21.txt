<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "inexplicable connection" to lagoon feels unearned. Emotional progression abstract ("tension palpable") without embodied cost. Micro-choices absent under pressure despite strong traits setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (lagoon's "mysteries beneath surface") lacks visible cost—conceptual weight ("weight of truth") remains abstract. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof test fails; no on-page sentence legibly pays price for revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon charges final image ("dark enigmatic presence") and constrains Naomi's purpose, but zeppelin library remains postcard setting without tactical pressure. Sensory detail vivid yet over-indexed on visual; body/tool constraints missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("uncover truth") never faces concrete test—no dramatized cost for decryption or parley. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks protagonist-driven escalation; "searing reverie" stated not earned through narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory/truth emerges implicitly but final line ("heart ablaze with fire of discovery") edges toward sentimentality. Avoids moralizing yet offers no resonant non-literal answer; lagoon's reflection motif lacks reweighting of prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature absent—both women speak in uniformly poetic diction ("weaving threads of history"). Register drift in "tension between revelation and secrecy was palpable" introduces diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("secrets waiting to be unlocked"/"secrets it held") and template cadence ("As she...") in opening. Overwriting in final paragraph ("vast and mysterious, full of hidden truths") dilutes momentum but avoids closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Retrocognitive twist transforms "memory" trope through debris messages, but civil-rights archivist feels underutilized. Emotional specificity in lagoon connection lacks freshness; premise risks derivative without deeper integration of Naomi's profession.</comment>
