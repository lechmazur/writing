<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear but interior conflict absent; all emotion labeled ("foxglove regret") without embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure—tending is reverent ritual, not contested action. "Gently systematic" trait stated but never tested with tradeoffs. Diagnostic labels like "sorrow tinged with appreciation" undermine authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise but cost remains abstract; "task never truly done" is stated not dramatized. Wind chime vibration during song feels decorative rather than causal escalation under Accumulative lens. No exact image conveys loss—cost proof test fails despite conceptual stakes. Orientation solid but weak pressure reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Opal library’s sensory details (luminescent orbs, bamboo chime) create vivid atmosphere but lack spatial choreography—no constraint on action. Glass orchids glow "otherworldly" yet never impede tending; setting functions as postcard, not crucible. Micro-setting potential in cracked tube unrealized despite lyrical specificity. Final "ethereal light" lacks tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) static—song "coaxes emotions back" without resistance or narrowing options. No escalation: singing succeeds instantly, no deepening of cost beyond abstract "constant attention." Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet; price remains conceptual, not felt in final image. Accumulative density increase superficial without tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges through glass orchids but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to power of memory"), triggering -0.6 penalty. "Foxglove regret" label becomes thematic echo, undercutting earned subtext. Resonance exists in "melancholic beauty" yet explicit statement replaces image-based wisdom. Organic emergence fails where abstraction dominates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("velvety softness of foxglove regret") but perceptual signature isn’t character-particular—uniformly ornate regardless of action. Under singing sequence (peak stress), syntax doesn’t compress; "museum of extinct feelings" drifts into academic register. No head-hopping, yet voice lacks modulation during emotional climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she worked... As she continued...") dulls immediacy in key beats. Filter-verb stack ("eyes lingered," "expression," "thoughts turned") in paragraph 3 obscures cause/effect. Final third’s "ethereal light, a testament" uses corporate diction during closure, triggering -0.7 artifact penalty. Overwriting in high-pressure moments reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Museum of extinct feelings" offers fresh framing but execution leans on magical realism tropes (lone caretaker, fragile relics). No risk-taking in structure—linear vignette avoids bold choices. Emotional specificity lacks; "foxglove regret" feels quirkily ornamental rather than transformative. Derivative premise guardrail applies: core arc works unchanged with generic setting swaps.</comment>
