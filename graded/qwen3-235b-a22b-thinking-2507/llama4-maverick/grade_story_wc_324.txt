<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "persistently curious" is stated but not tested under pressure. Woman's grief embodied well ("tears streaming"), but Aria's choices lack visible cost—no tradeoffs in her "sense of responsibility" despite emotional toll. Final renunciation (continuing work) feels unearned without prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors instantly ("twilight descended, mist-clad atrium"). Closure is Earned Stasis (Aria's continued work) with felt cost (woman's tears subsiding = emotional price paid). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: mist clearing reweights stakes via density shift. Cost proof weak—"grip relaxed" shows relief, not sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mist and hearing aid function as micro-setting but fail 9+ gate: mist clearing reacts to Aria's words without constraining choices (e.g., no physical barrier). Hearing aid pulses fade at end but don't charge final image meaningfully ("just a memory" lacks specificity). Sensory detail vivid yet ornamental—no tactical constraint on Aria's movement or decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (reconnecting sister) signaled early, one deepening via mist clearing. But escalation isn't driven by Aria's agency—her "assurance" passively resolves conflict without cost (no exhaustion, doubt, or consequence). Woman's tears stopping signifies relief, not a price paid; stakes lack visceral weight despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of "incidental heroism" emerges through action but final line states it outright ("incidental heroism that lay just beyond perception"), triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Woman's closure offers resonance, yet moralizing replaces earned ambiguity. Avoids sentimentality but fails non-literal answer test—closure leans on explicit labeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reeling hush," "whispers of the past") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control strong in high-stakes beats ("tears flowed harder... balm to her sorrow"). Minor flaw: "persistently curious" labeled twice as filter-verb abstraction, dulling immediacy without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose avoids fatal artifacts but has scaffold ("Aria felt an instant connection... sense of responsibility") and repetitive "gentle" modifiers. Final beat slightly overwritten ("sound... grew fainter, until it was just a memory"). Information density high yet propulsion falters in reflection ("the sound... echoing through her mind"). No closure-dulling loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" transforms grief tropes through specific mechanics (hearing aid pulses), but emotional arc stays familiar. Woman's photograph reprise feels earned, yet "incidental heroism" lacks fresh inflection—resolution avoids risk (peace without cost). Specific details (faded photo, atrium's past) elevate beyond template, but conceptual integrity wavers in final moralizing.</comment>
