<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Claustrophobia vanishes without struggle during climax ("felt her claustrophobia melting away"), breaking causality. Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("prudently adventurous spirit") violating embodied emotion standards. Contradictory impulses absent when key trait resolves unnaturally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing: "key" as insight) lacks legible cost—wistful rebellion feels abstract, not visceral. Spatial mutiny occurs via deus ex machina without buildup. Lens (Hybrid) holds but cost proof test fails: no concrete image anchors sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus anchors early with vivid sensory texture ("damp earth and forgotten history"). Blueprint compass functions as micro-setting during lock-picking, charging final image ("clutched in hand"). Environment constrains choice minimally but charges closure sufficiently for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes shift abruptly from physical key to insight without earned escalation. Protagonist agency passive during spatial mutiny ("felt herself being drawn"); music guides without character-driven pressure. Cost remains abstract ("pang of wistful rebellion") lacking visible tradeoff under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through crystal realization ("vital key... profound insight"), avoiding moralizing. Final starlight image reweights journey without stating morals. Strong thematic resonance though "fallow period" terminology risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice distinctive in tunnel descriptions ("perfume of damp earth") but register drifts into purple prose during climax ("electric thrill run through her veins"). Perceptual signature consistent; no dialogue present. Overwriting slightly dulls pressure in key beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Lyra felt... replaced by...") and filter-verb stacks ("Lyra felt an inexplicable connection") in high-pressure beats. Thematic echo ("testament to prudently adventurous spirits") triggers -0.5 penalty. Artifacts dull closure image despite strong opening rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Insight as key" twist transforms trope through specific crystal mechanics. But "spatial mutiny" and "fallow period" feel like buzzword stuffing rather than organic integration. Emotional truth undermined by unearned claustrophobia resolution.</comment>
