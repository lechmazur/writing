<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("sophisticated sorrow") without embodied contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as no conflicting impulses act in scene during pivotal net-untangling. Diagnostic label "sophisticated sorrow" triggers penalty without visceral cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost in final snow globe image, but orientation falters—Eli's expertise isn't anchored until paragraph 3, weakening early causality. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet isn't clearly taught before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sunken library's sensory details (luminescent fish, salt decay) vividly frame mood, but setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices—pressure from environment only surfaces during ascent, too late to shape core conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through reflection, yet escalation lacks protagonist agency; net-untangling reveals message passively, with no meaningful trade-off or narrowed options under Accumulative lens. Conceptual cost feels earned but not viscerally charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through snow globe's evolution from "winter wonderland" to "empty of snow," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "letting go" as fluidity without abstraction, though "sophisticated sorrow" slightly tips into pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("saltwater and weight of discoveries") with rhythmic control in reflective moments. Register drift in "sophisticated sorrow" is minor; compression of deep-sea exploration taught early and paid off in closure's crystallized insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in "sophisticated sorrow"—therapy-speak label in high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Otherwise, prose avoids loops; final line's snow metaphor delivers closure without muddle, though abstraction slightly obscures emotional cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics metaphor with surrender avoids cliché, and snow globe's evolution feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but emotional specificity lacks one transformative inflection to reach 9.0+.</comment>
