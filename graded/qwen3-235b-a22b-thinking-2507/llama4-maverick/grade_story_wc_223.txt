<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation for crisis actor ("benevolently ruthless") remains label-only without embodied contradiction; survivor’s internal shift lacks micro-choices under pressure. Historian’s drive to document small gestures is stated but not dramatized through cost-bearing actions, reducing credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "suspended in luminous absence" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (void as opportunity). Accumulative lens holds through patterned walking and historian’s weaving, though causality falters in historian’s sudden alliance acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery’s acoustics amplify words into prophecy, constraining choices; chessboard missing pawns charges the final image. But interregnum timeframe remains vague backdrop without tightening tactics, missing full constraint potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbinding past to fill void) tightens via walking pattern’s escalating words, reweighting "luminous absence" with conceptual cost. Historian’s agency drives deepening, but crisis actor’s sudden alliance proposal lacks causal escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures shaping history emerges through walking-pattern words and chessboard symbolism, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "void" as opportunity without stating a moral, though historian’s exposition edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV stable with crisis actor’s perceptual bias (shadowy realms, tactical focus), but interiority relies on abstract phrases like "silent understanding." Voice modulates well under pressure except for generic descriptors like "glance of understanding."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains rhythmic control with purposeful variation ("soft creaking," "deliberate pattern"), but abstract phrases like "weight of unspoken words" dilute momentum. Zero scaffold loops; final line’s "luminous absence" recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actors/survivors with historical quest avoids trope pitfalls, though "nomadic penumbra" feels underexplored. Bold risk in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but interregnum context lacks specific transformation beyond generic void symbolism.</comment>
