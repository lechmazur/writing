<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("modestly fearless") without embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost despite thematic resonance. "Luminous ache" functions as diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, undermining earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (harp fading, tooth forgotten) but cost remains abstract—"weight of her task" lacks concrete legibility. Accumulative escalation holds, yet no on-page sentence crystallizes the felt price demanded for high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's sensory texture (mist, harp notes) anchors atmosphere vividly, but the crocodile's tooth—while recurring—fails as micro-setting: it charges no choice and merely decorates closure as "forgotten relic," missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the spirit's confession, yet resolution lacks legible cost; "satisfaction" and "purpose fulfilled" feel emotionally sanitized. Agency-driven escalation stalls as the harp's distortion resolves itself without the collector paying tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (tooth, harp), but final paragraph moralizes—"beacon of hope in the darkness"—triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Earned resonance collapses into abstract assertion, undercutting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV voice shines with lyrical precision ("hush of a hidden sunrise," whispers of restless dead"), though "luminous ache" jars as academic diction. Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, avoiding emotional ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure beat drowns in figurative muddle: "luminous ache" and "trail of peace" create mixed metaphors. Template cadence ("The collector...") and paraphrase loops ("sense of satisfaction, a sense of purpose") sap propulsion in critical moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tropes (soul collector, trapped spirit) feel reheated; the crocodile's tooth offers quirky ornament but no transformative logic. Emotional specificity falters as "luminous ache" echoes Joan Didion without fresh contextualization.</comment>
