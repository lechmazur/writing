<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Label-heavy interiority ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") lacks embodied contradiction; micro-choices during dice rolls are repetitive rather than revealing hierarchy of values. Closure (Earned Stasis) feels unearned as motivation remains abstract ("capture texture of missed opportunity") without concrete prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building pressure, but closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—phrases like "weight of obsession" remain vague. Orientation is solid (staircase established by line 3), but "rupture" beat fails to reconfigure stakes as required; cost proof test fails with no on-page cost image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details ("air thickened," "shadows snatching at my clothes") anchor setting early, but staircase never constrains choices—it’s backdrop not micro-setting. Dice function as recurring object yet fail Q3 9+ gate: their "imperfection" doesn’t charge the final image or alter tactics beyond abstract contemplation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving perpetual motion) is signaled but remains abstract; "rupture" beat lacks tangible consequences to narrow options. Escalation is purely textual (dense imagery) without deepening knowledge or altering tactics—no visible price paid for obsession despite "weight" mentions. Coincidence (dice rolls) complicates but doesn’t test commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (hope in confinement) emerges through dice/staircase motifs but collapses into overt moralizing: "grim optimism that would forever drive me forward" in final paragraph triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Epiphany lacks earned complexity; "boundless confinement" resolves into tidy binary rather than resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air thickened with weight of endless steps") reflects obsessive POV, but high-pressure beats devolve into template cadence: 8 consecutive "I [verb]" openings during dice contemplation dull immediacy. No dialogue present, so voice distinction bullets inapplicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks plague climax ("I felt the weight," "I was consumed," "I saw")—3+ lines in high-pressure beat trigger -0.5 penalty and disallow 9+. Paraphrase loops ("endless steps"/"never-ending labyrinth") and synonym churn ("tantalizing mystery"/"fleeting glimpse of possibility") dilute momentum despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dice/staircase fusion offers fresh inflection on philosophical tropes, but "perpetual motion" premise relies on abstract contemplation rather than grounded stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, yet Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: obsession motif lacks transformation beyond familiar "quest for meaning" frameworks.</comment>
