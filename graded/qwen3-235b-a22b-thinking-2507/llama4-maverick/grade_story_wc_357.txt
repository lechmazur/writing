<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lack of contradictory impulses weakens motivation; "inexplicable connection" to arrow tip feels unearned without prior character-specific flaw or contradiction. Micro-choice to examine it shows promise but isn't charged by visible internal conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words (unclear planetary rules/location anchors), costing 0.4. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost ("never see the orchard... same way again"), but gravity countdown pressure isn't meaningfully tracked as a live clock despite setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard's floating arches constrain navigation (water flow method), and the echo pool's "whirling silence" charges the final image. However, gravity inversion's physical impact on Lyra ("stomach drop") isn't woven into action beyond initial sensation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; inverted gravity's effect on growth happens *to* Lyra rather than through her choices. Cost ("changed course of history") remains abstract despite her personal awe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo cripples resonance: "source of resilience was not just... but the gathering of echoes itself" states the thesis outright in final discovery beat. Resonant potential in "broken arrow vibrating with echoes" is undermined by explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "water flow navigation" and plant descriptions, but tense shifts ("Lyra felt... Lyra noticed") create inconsistent psychic distance during high-pressure discovery of the pool.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mixed metaphor "whirling silence, a cacophony of sound that was somehow quiet" violates physical logic (-0.5). Otherwise strong propulsion, but "ethereal fingers" simile during climax uses generic lyricism where concrete specificity would heighten cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-pilot gravity inversion is undermined by derivative "broken arrow = connection to past" trope. Emotional truth in Lyra's awe elevates it, but lacks the non-obvious moral calculus required for high-band originality.</comment>
