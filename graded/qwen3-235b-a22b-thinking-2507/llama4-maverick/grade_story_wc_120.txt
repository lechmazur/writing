<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation for "conductor of unheard symphonies" remains abstract and unearned; no contradictory impulses shown during mapping. Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "chronologically homesick heart aching" without embodied cost, triggering -0.5 penalty in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the writer's resolved departure, but cost ("exhaustion hit") is future-tense and conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page. Orientation flawless within 120 words, yet accumulation cap -0.8 applied for two distinct non-closure issues: vague time pressure and thematic echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting creates vivid atmosphere ("shard of ice piercing sky"), but the glass spire and frozen lake function as postcard backdrops rather than constraining choices. Micro-setting (nautilus shell) is ornamental—its "pulsing" doesn't alter mapping tactics, failing 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: mapping proceeds smoothly without density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift. Stakes ("reignite spark") remain abstract; "upturned hush" introduces no tangible pressure. Accumulation cap -1.5 applied for three distinct issues including static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory/artistry emerges through particulars, but final paragraph moralizes ("world full of hidden harmonies... bring them to life"), triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Lacks resonant non-literal answer; "blurred boundaries" concept stated not earned through constrained choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture ("topography of memories") with rhythmic control, but register drifts into pretentious abstraction ("conductor of unheard symphonies") uncharacteristic for a fortune cookie writer. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—no evidence of how trade shapes noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As the [time]..., the writer's [action]...") repeats 5× with paraphrase loops in closure beat. Mixed metaphor ("air heavy with upturned hush") and filter-verb stack ("knew that they had to seize...") dull immediacy. Accumulation cap -1.5 for three distinct artifacts including closure-beat muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some freshness in "symmetry that beckoned" motif, but derivative elements (nautilus=time, mapping=memory) lack transformation. Fails proximity check—swap "frozen lake" for any reflective surface and arc remains identical. Avoids safety middle but lacks verifiable detail about fortune cookie writing.</comment>
