<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction remains abstract ("amoral philanthropist" label repeated without embodied tension); the egg's significance isn't tested through micro-choices under pressure, reducing her sentimentality to told emotion rather than visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works with the restored ecosystem, but the cost is conceptual only—the philanthropist vanishes without sacrifice, and the map's mechanics lack causal demonstration ("using the map... to guide her" feels handwaved during the pivotal release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt flat's cracks function as micro-setting, guiding her path and charging the final image; however, the egg-as-tool constrains choice only superficially (fragility noted but never tested during the walk), missing full integration with tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite the drought's setup; pressure escalates texturally through the thunder's urgency, but no tangible cost narrows options—the philanthropist succeeds unimpeded, weakening the "fractured grace" tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" resonates in the salt flat's transformation, but the final paragraph over-explains ("a testament to the power of her vision"), diluting earned subtext; the extinct birds' echo avoids sentimentality yet feels unearned by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric voice ("air heavy with dry earth scent") but interiority relies on labels ("pang of sentimentality"); the "amoral philanthropist" repetition reads like prompt echo, and stress responses lack character-specific perceptual degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Redundant loops dilute impact: "echo" appears four times in the final paragraph, and "cracked expanse" repeats without deepening; overwriting in high-pressure moments ("deafening crash that shook foundations") muddles the closure beat's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological action with "fractured grace" tone, but the manufactured drought concept leans on familiar tropes without deepening the moral calculus; the salt flat's transformation feels inevitable yet lacks distinctive human complexity in execution.</comment>
