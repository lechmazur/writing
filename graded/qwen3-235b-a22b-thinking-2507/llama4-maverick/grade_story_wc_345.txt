<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction or micro-choices; settlers function as a collective prop with no individual agency. Aria's "altruism" remains label-only without visible tradeoffs or earned change. Lyra's sole action (creating garden) lacks causal connection to climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "settlers" identity unclear until paragraph 3 (~180 words), violating the 120-word anchor rule with no disorientation payoff. Closure is vague celebration without felt cost—energy "shifts" but no visible consequence or constraint reconfiguration. No causal linkage between chalk messages and outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid but catalog-like descriptions ("lush trees," "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures") lack urgency-filtered perception. Floating arches serve as static backdrop without pressuring choices; watering bell's sound merely decorates scenes. Final image fails 9+ gate—no object constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("collective effort") remain abstract with no concrete test. Nebula energy is "harnessed" magically without resistance or cost—settlers feel "connection" but no tactics alter. Band guardrail failure: zero visible price charges the final image; escalation is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Thematic moralizing dominates: "power of collective effort" and "beacon of hope" state the thesis outright. Final paragraph violates Q5 rule—explicit moral replaces earned resonance. No complex ambiguity; "altruistic spirit" reduces theme to simplistic platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Expository omniscience flattens into tourist narration ("breathtaking beauty," "testament to turbulent history"). Uniform descriptive cadence regardless of emotional weight; passive constructions dilute agency ("Aria began to sense"). No perceptual signature—details lack character-specific bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Template cadence: "As..., [subject]..." opens 4 paragraphs. Paraphrase loops ("struggles and triumphs... hardship... thriving community"). Filter-verb stack in paragraph 5 ("began to sense... realized... began to reexamine") dulls immediacy. Final line overwrites with abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.3</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Derivative premise (benevolent spirit guides community) with zero transformation—swap "nebula" for "crystal" without altering story. "Brambled hope" is vague abstraction lacking verifiable specificity. Emotional truth sacrificed for generic uplift; safety-middle hedging avoids risk.</comment>
