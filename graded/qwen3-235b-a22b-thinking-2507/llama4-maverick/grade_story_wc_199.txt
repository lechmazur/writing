<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; transformation feels unearned despite "mossy delight" embodiment. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond abstract "forever changed," violating Q1's 9+ gate for contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands but cost proof test fails: "forever changed" is abstract, not legible on-page. Lens ambiguity ("prophecy" implies causal stakes unresolved by textural accumulation) prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("bark shimmered like moon") anchors setting, but arbor never constrains choices or charges final image beyond postcard description, failing 9+ gate for micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding prophecy) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the moonstone acts *on* her, not through her choices. Cost ("irreversible transformation") remains conceptual, not viscerally felt per Q4 band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "monuments to forgotten things" motif, with final image ("prod of legacy guiding future") offering non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing but "mossy delight" borders on thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lunar light," "whispers of past") sustains voice, but "thrill of mossy delight" shows register drift into forced idiom during high-pressure decoding beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("complex code"/"decoding the leaves") and closure-beat overwriting ("heart full of wonder... deeper understanding") reduce density. Final paragraph's thematic summary dulls cost legibility per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Ashen skyborne arbor" synthesizes tropes freshly, but "prophecy in leaves" framework feels template-like. Emotional specificity ("mossy delight") elevates, yet Derivative Premise Guardrail caps high-band entry.</comment>
