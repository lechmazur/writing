<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure absent; "spark reignite" moment lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses despite clear motivation. Diagnostic label "cycle of repetition and boredom" edges toward therapy-speak without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ephemerality of art), but "if only for a moment" lacks visceral legibility. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently with density increase toward final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("colors seep into the trees"), constraining Lena's tactile interaction with the fresco fragment. Sensory hierarchy (damp earth scent, visual fog) filtered through artist POV elevates beyond postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic renewal) signaled early but pressure lacks coherent escalation; fog's atmospheric presence never actively opposes her. No on-page tightening choice or deepening that alters tactics despite Lena's "spark reignite" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of art's transience emerges through fresco fragment's "inner light" reprise, but "reborn, one brushstroke at a time" borders on thematic echo. Avoids moralizing but lacks resonant non-literal answer to central question in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vivid mural artist roamed, seeking inspiration") shows selective artist's noticing. Minor psychic distance slip in "Lena paints with light" repetition disrupts rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in "veil between reality and dreams" repetition (-0.4) and template cadence ("as she...") in final paragraph. High density otherwise, but "morbid perfume" cliché dulls closure image despite strong textural specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog as active collaborator in art-making avoids ruin-porn tropes. Derivative premise guardrail applies (-0.3) as "lost artist finds inspiration in decay" lacks non-obvious moral calculus despite specific orchard details.</comment>
