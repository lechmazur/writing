<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Queen's motivation (unraveling dreams) lacks contradictory impulses; "sense of trepidation/purpose/menace" relies on label-heavy abstraction without embodied contradiction. Companion remains a silent cipher, failing relationship-as-crucible. Final "changed forever" lacks visible cost beyond vague thematic assertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise at grotto's heart) lacks legible cost: "truth that would change her forever" is abstract, failing cost-proof test. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, but hooded-figure backstory feels retroactively patched, weakening causality. Orientation clear by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid ozone/smoke/starlight descriptions anchor atmosphere, but setting remains ornamental backdrop. Cobalt/ember grottos never constrain choices (e.g., no physical barriers altering tactics). Final "secrets" image lacks micro-setting specificity to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reality unraveling) never faces concrete test; escalation is atmospheric, not driven by queen's agency. "Changed forever" implies cost but remains abstract—no visible price paid (e.g., sacrificed tool, altered relationship). Stakes declared but not viscerally felt in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme ("fabric of reality unravels") explicitly stated by hooded figure, violating organic emergence. Final line moralizes ("secrets that lay within") instead of offering resonant image. Bleeding starlight motif recurs but lacks evolution to reweight premise; thematic echo in climax triggers -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with strong perceptual signature (light/smoke focus), but stress-induced thought degradation absent—queen articulates "lacy menace" with unnatural precision mid-crisis. Companion's "deep sadness" tells rather than shows. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sense of trepidation... sense of purpose... sense of lacy menace" demonstrates synonym churn (-0.3). Final paragraph's "swallowed whole by shadows" creates figurative muddle. Strong verbs ("writhe," "pulsing") offset generic labels, but scaffold phrases dilute momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tropes (mystical queen, ancient grotto) lack transformative specificity—emotional flatness undermines "disenchanted" premise. Bleeding starlight offers fresh angle but resolves into vague "truth," avoiding bold risk. Derivative safety-middle approach caps originality; no verifiable detail to anchor universals.</comment>
