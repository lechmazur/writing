<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("fingers itched to probe," "scent of old books transported"), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear yet untested by meaningful opposition, reducing earned change to quiet acceptance without visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("sense of completion") lacks legible cost—no altered tactics or tangible loss; "bronze quiet" atmosphere accumulates but fails to reweight stakes with felt consequence, undermining the Accumulative/Textural lens at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the tapestry fragment constrains Emilia’s focus ("displaced axis"), and "bronze quiet" evolves from descriptor to embodied state that charges the final image ("lingered within her"), though silo walls remain atmospheric rather than tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering secrets) faces no opposition; escalation stalls as diaries/tapestry yield answers without cost—no narrowing of options or deepening that alters Emilia’s approach, violating Accumulative lens requirement for density shifts with reweighted stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "bronze quiet" and tapestry’s "displaced axis," but final resonance ("secrets still lay hidden") lacks conceptual cost; avoids moralizing yet stops short of reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive nature," tactile handling of relics) with rhythmic control; "bronze quiet" refrain modulates intensity, though "whispers of forgotten tales" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("As she..."/"With...") dilute momentum in mid-beats; "bronze quiet" repetition crosses into thematic echo by closure, slightly dulling the final image’s charge despite otherwise clean, textured prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Time after last human dream" premise transforms archival tropes through specific sensory logic ("bronze quiet"), but risk-taking stays within safe lyrical bounds—no bold structural choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
