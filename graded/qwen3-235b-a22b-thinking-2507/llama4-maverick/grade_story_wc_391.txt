<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "sculpt patience" remains abstract despite embodied details like crunching snow. No flaws compound choices—revolution feels externally granted, not earned through struggle with impatience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred but closure lacks legible cost: viaduct’s hum signals revolution yet no forfeiture or altered tactic appears on-page. "Nothing would ever be the same" asserts change without dramatized consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake create cohesive atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices—mapper moves freely across ice. Viaduct’s humming charges the final image yet fails to shape tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("patient revolution") remains abstract; no tightening of options or visible price paid. Revolution "begins" off-page via moon/viaduct, reducing conflict to internal resolve without external test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme drowns in thematic echo: "unyoke themselves" and "nothing would ever be the same" state morals outright. Revolution concept lacks earned complexity—no counter-readings or ambiguous cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "magnetic viaduct glistening with raindrops," but rhythmic control falters under pressure: repetitive "as she..." clauses dull immediacy during climax. No head-hopping, yet voice lacks stress-induced compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she walked... As she stood...") creates paraphrase loops; "softly purposeful" repeated without variation. Final image’s "inner light" overwrites concrete cost with vague lyricism, dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details feel fresh, but "patient revolution" trope lacks transformation—generic rebellion imagery ("unyoke," "new era") isn’t grounded in specific stakes. No bold risk beyond surface-level lyricism.</comment>
