<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("turmoil," "nagging question") without embodied contradiction; final acceptance of forgiveness lacks earned causality from specific prior choices, though "refracting truth" metaphor shows character-particular vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("price of forgiveness was not to be paid, but understood"), but ritual ambiguity weakens lens coherence; mist parting reveals spire's symbols yet ritual's nature remains unanchored, diluting causal pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pale spire charges final image with etched symbols, satisfying 9+ gate; bone towers and mist create vivid sensory hierarchy but fail to constrain choices—environment remains backdrop rather than active pressure on art-making tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding forgiveness cost) tighten via ritual's approach, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—mist responds magically to poetry rather than choices narrowing options; "forged hush" peace shows felt cost yet doesn't alter tangible tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracting metaphor, but final paragraph's direct statement ("price... not to be paid") triggers thematic echo penalty; avoids sentimentality yet edges toward didacticism in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wove her art through mist-shrouded air") and rhythmic control shine, but stress-induced compression falters—peak-beat diction stays uniformly elevated without syntactic shortening during "crescendo" voice surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; "refract a single truth into many" slightly muddles refraction metaphor but avoids figurative muddle in closure. Final thematic line risks overwriting yet propels momentum without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone canyon and forgiveness theme elevates cliché, but "price of forgiveness" phrasing echoes common discourse; emotional specificity in art-as-revelation avoids safety middle yet lacks transformative risk at climax.</comment>
