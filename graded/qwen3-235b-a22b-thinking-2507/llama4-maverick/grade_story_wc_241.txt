<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") without sufficient embodied contradiction; micro-choices lack pressure-driven specificity despite clear motivation. The heart attack's visceral cost remains undramatized in her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (acknowledging the path's difficulty), but the Accumulative lens weakens causality—subway insights accumulate without narrowing options. Cost proof falters: "long and difficult" is stated, not viscerally legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rainwashed library and mica-pane lantern function as micro-setting, charging the final image ("beacon guiding her"). Sensory specificity (musty books, rain melody) elevates atmosphere, though weather lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes (helping father overcome addiction) tighten through subway reflections, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—insights emerge passively from graffiti. The "quest for certainty" deepening reweights meaning, yet cost ("long path") feels abstract, not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through probability/graffiti interplay; avoids moralizing with the lantern's final glow reconfiguring "lucid contradictions" as hope. No thematic echo—resonance stems from concrete particulars like the shadow metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct academic-poetic voice ("theoretically rebellious," "clover melancholy") with rhythmic control under reflection. Perceptual signature shines in library/subway details, though abstract phrasing ("widening perspectives") slightly distances urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("glow," "shine," "glinting" around the lantern) and one paraphrase ("calm her"/"soothing melody") mar density. No closure-impacting artifacts; lyrical compression serves the Accumulative lens effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory and addiction reframes "certainty" as the core wound. Risk-taking (reflection-heavy structure) heightens emotional truth, though the lantern's symbolism borders on conventional. Transformation test passed via mica-pane specificity.</comment>
