<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans intellectual ("mathematics of fair trade") over embodied contradiction; diagnostic label-speak in peak moment ("felt a surge of determination") triggers anti-pattern penalty. Shift to resolve lacks visible struggle between fear and agency during the decisive choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with felt cost ("breach boundaries... get us caught") under Accumulative lens. Final image reweights ink pot’s meaning while maintaining textural pressure; cost legible in "uncertain future" and "risk" without softening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: formaldehyde/flowers scents and steel tables charge the ink pot’s "morbid beauty," constraining Lena’s tactile focus. Final image’s "deathly vitality" ties object to closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via director’s "reconsideration" demand, narrowing options to "breach protocol or get caught." Escalation driven by Lena’s agency (ink pot perspective shift), but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral in the single pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "fair trade" emerges through ink pot’s evolving symbolism and Lena’s mathematical musings, avoiding moralizing. Final image’s "uncertain future" offers resonant, non-literal answer to value-of-freedom question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lena’s tactile focus ("cradled," "turned over") and math metaphors; rhythm modulates with tension. Voice stays within POV lexicon, though "liquefy rigid thinking" slightly drifts into abstraction during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Template cadence in final beats ("she felt... she knew... she was ready") dulls closure momentum. Figurative muddle ("deathly vitality") is intentional but risks opacity; scaffold loops in ink pot handling reduce density despite strong opening prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con artist ethos with mathematical justice framing elevates familiar grift trope. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through ink pot’s charged reprise, though funeral home setting lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
