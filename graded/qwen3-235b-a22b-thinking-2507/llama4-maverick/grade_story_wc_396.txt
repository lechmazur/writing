<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Label-heavy traits ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") lack embodied contradiction; motivation stated as abstract thesis ("map empathy onto action") without visceral cost or flawed struggle during crystal reconstitution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words ("shadow-laced peacekeeper" insufficient anchoring); closure lacks visible cost—crystal's glow resolves tension without forfeiture, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirement for density shift with price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Orchard/ice setting provides vivid texture but never constrains choices; micro-setting (crystal fragment) charges final image ("pulsing blue light") yet remains passive—environment doesn't pressure action per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("fragile balance") stays abstract; no escalation beyond atmospheric deepening, violating Accumulative lens requirement for pattern break or cost reweighting—ice floes shift but exert zero pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo ("mapped empathy onto shifting landscapes") explicitly states thesis in final paragraph, triggering -0.7 penalty; insights feel unearned as epiphanies arise from reflection, not struggle with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uniform lyrical cadence lacks perceptual signature—no character-specific noticing bias; "committee voice" flattens texture despite poetic diction, failing rhythmic modulation under pressure during crystal reassembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><grade>Paraphrase loops ("weighted breath before reply" x3) and template cadence ("She was...", "Her...") trigger -0.9 artifacts; overwriting dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats like mirror-gazing sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Derivative peacekeeper/crystal tropes lack fresh synthesis; "shadow-laced" adds superficial novelty but premise remains template-bound, failing transformation test—emotional arc works unchanged with generic "guardian" substitution.</comment>
