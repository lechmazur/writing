<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("meek" yet driven) lacks concrete flaws tested under pressure; "quietly determined" trait stated but not embodied in micro-choices during forging climax; apprentice arrival feels transactional for theme rather than earned relationship shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "azure defiance" and sword success show triumph without visible sacrifice or altered state; Charged Poise undermined by absence of legible price for transformation despite "felt cost" claims; lens (Hybrid) holds but cost gap breaks Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard scent and magician's silk vividly anchor setting early; floating rock arches function as resonant motif charging final image; mine shafts described but never constrain choices—micro-setting potential unrealized despite strong sensory economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("coax resilience from rubble") but pressure lacks escalation; forging process shows steady work without narrowing options or meaningful trade-offs; "azure defiance" feels unearned as no prior cost constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" concept remains abstract thematic echo rather than driving choices; "transformation" theme lands through final image but lacks complexity—no counter-readings or earned ambiguity; avoids moralizing yet oversimplifies struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in forge details ("sweet scent of blooming orchard trees," silk's "shifting patterns"); voice modulates well until apprentice arrival triggers generic "wonder" dialogue; minor register drift in "azure defiance" label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Three filter-verb stacks in climax ("I felt," "I knew," "I saw") dull immediacy; mixed metaphors ("phoenix from ashes" amid orchard imagery) create coherence issues; lyrical overwriting in "azure defiance" violates POV lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet setting offers fresh inflection on blacksmith tropes; "magician's silk" transforms material alchemy but relies on familiar mystical-object convention; avoids derivative premise yet safety-hedging in conflict resolution limits boldness.</comment>
