<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("overwhelming urge," "sense of peace") without contradictory impulses; "lately inspired" trait remains ornamental, failing to create tangible trade-offs under pressure. Final choice lacks felt cost beyond emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "sense of peace" replaces concrete stakes, with no before/after reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds through imagery density, but water-damage "revelation" feels coincidental, not earned by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Violà and water actively constrain choices—tilting the program manipulates images, while the viola’s vibration merges with the mystery. Final image of water echoing La Bohème charges closure by reweighting the setting’s emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>No escalation: "unraveling the code" faces zero resistance; water damage "reveals" images effortlessly, making the conflict passive. Dominant stake remains abstract, with no narrowing of options or visible price paid during the process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme ("in between spaces") is reiterated but not transformed through action; final moralizing ("forever changed," "magic beyond reality") replaces earned resonance. Lacks ambiguity—the code’s resolution feels unearned and symmetrical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct musician’s perceptual signature (noticing unstruck chords, viola vibrations) anchors voice, but rhythm stagnates in mid-section with repetitive "as" constructions. Avoids dialogue pitfalls but overuses filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Scaffold loops dilute momentum ("Rachel felt... Rachel saw... Rachel pondered" in quick succession); "haunting and sublime" emotional labeling in the climax feels abstract. Strong specificity in early beats (water-damaged program images) elevates density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Water-damage code mechanic transforms the ghost trope, but "liminal spaces" concept feels overused. Emotional specificity (musician’s bond with scores) avoids cliché, yet resolution’s tidiness undercuts risk—no meaningful cost to the discovery.</comment>
