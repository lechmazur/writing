<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation but lacks embodied struggle; "trembling calm" realization feels earned yet insufficiently tested through micro-choices under pressure. Flaws like smell loss remain abstract rather than driving concrete tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with resonant reconfiguration of "occluded views," but cost of smell loss remains thematic rather than dramatized on-page. Orientation clear by line 3, though pressure accumulation lacks tangible escalation beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Water clock shop functions as essential micro-setting; the birthing clamp screw charges the final image through reweighted meaning. Sensory details like "gentle lapping of water" constrain perception yet stop short of actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: dominant stake (finding meaning without smell) remains abstract and untested through action. Reflection dominates without narrowing options or creating tangible friction; "trembling calm" realization lacks visible cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the screw's evolving symbolism and fog imagery, avoiding moralizing. Final line's "subtle vibrations" offers resonant non-literal answer, though "unveiling ordinary miracles" slightly edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in aromatherapist's tactile focus ("weight of its purpose"); rhythmic control sustains lyrical compression. Minor filter-verb clusters in reflective passages slightly dull immediacy during low-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits controlled rhythm and textural specificity ("soft, diffused light"), but "trembling calm" repetition creates subtle loops. Strategic abstraction in reflective blocks avoids overwriting yet slightly dilutes momentum in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water clocks and birthing tool creates unique sensory framework, though "reading between lines" concept feels familiar. Bold lyric structure pays off coherently but avoids transformative risk in emotional stakes.</comment>
