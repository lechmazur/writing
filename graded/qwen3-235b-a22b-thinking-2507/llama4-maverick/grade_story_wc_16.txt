<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("carefully reckless intensity") shows in transcription process, but "symphonies of truth" and "restore trust" phrasing reads as diagnostic label-speak during peak revelation, violating embodied emotion standards at the climax where cost should be visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation test fails: spatial anchors ("labyrinthine repository") lack concrete who/where/when clarity by 120 words. Closure (Charged Poise) has conceptual cost ("silence dissipating"), but the cost proof test fails—no exact sentence makes emotional price legible beyond abstract assertions like "weight lifting."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("whisper a promise"), but it never constrains choices—its mystical significance remains decorative rather than altering tactics during transcription, missing the 9+ gate requirement for environmental pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring trust) tighten through Accumulative pressure as glyphs reveal patterns, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "breakthrough" happens passively ("words began to take on new significance"), and the felt cost ("silence dissipating") remains abstract without concrete on-page legibility like physical exhaustion or relational consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth emerges through transcription particulars, but final-paragraph moralizing ("crucial step towards restoring trust") violates organic emergence. The "symphonies of truth" refrain becomes thematic echo, explicitly stating the thesis instead of letting the ink well's final whisper resonate ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice has strong textural rhythm ("flickering light of luminescent orbs cast eerie shadows"), but register drift occurs when "interconnected promises" and "symphonies of truth" inject academic diction mid-crisis, clashing with a linguist's plausible lexicon during high-pressure transcription.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "reverence and fervor" followed by "carefully reckless intensity," and "symphonies of truth" repeated 4x with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence ("As she worked...") in the climax dulls immediacy, violating the zero-loops 9+ standard despite otherwise vivid prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arcane linguist trope feels untransformed—archive setting and ink well symbolism echo familiar academic redemption arcs without fresh inflection. The textural accumulation has ingenuity, but emotional specificity lacks risk; "cautious exuberance" avoids bold vulnerability for safe middle-ground hedging.</comment>
