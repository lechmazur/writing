<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs identity loss) is embodied early via "unpardonable silence," but "nerve regeneration" breaks character-bound knowledge. Micro-choice of tracing discoloration reveals value hierarchy, yet final realization lacks visceral cost—epiphany remains cerebral despite "frostbitten hope" attempting embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: snow clearing crystallizes silence's reconfiguration from burden to strength with conceptual cost ("price of their own voice"). Lens is Accumulative/Textural, but "nerve regeneration" ambiguity undermines causality early. Cost proof lands via "silence was no longer oppressive," though medical metaphor muddles stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cobalt fortress" and "dusty spiral staircase" create vivid texture, yet setting remains atmospheric postcard—snow doesn't pressure choices, and piano bolt appears randomly. Micro-setting (discoloration) guides movement but fails to constrain tactics; "cobalt" is poetic ornament without causal weight on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs safety) tightens via figure's appearance, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—their bolt-tightening is coincidence, not earned pressure. "Cost of safety" deepens through reflection, yet the price ("voice") feels abstract until final lines. No visible forfeiture alters tactics; cost remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through discoloration-as-path and bolt-tightening mundanity, but final paragraph moralizes: "silence was a reminder of their strength" states the thesis directly. "Frostbitten hope" avoids sentimentality early, yet resolution leans into tidy affirmation, undermining complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seraphically mundane air," "frostbitten hope") with rhythmic control—short clauses mirror vigilance, lyrical cadences for reflection. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean. Minor flaw: "unpardonable silence" edges toward authorial intrusion, but compression serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "dusty spiral staircase" does triple duty (setting/constraint/symbol). Minor synonym churn ("stillness was almost palpable, a heavy blanket") and "nerve regeneration" jargon break POV lexicon. Final image ("snow finally began to clear") crystallizes closure without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" transforms silent-guardian trope through specific details (piano bolt, cobalt fortress), but "frostbitten hope" feels derivative. Emotional truth in questioning safety's cost is fresh, yet resolution avoids risk—silence reconfigured as strength lacks moral ambiguity. Authentic synthesis, but safety middle dilutes stakes.</comment>
