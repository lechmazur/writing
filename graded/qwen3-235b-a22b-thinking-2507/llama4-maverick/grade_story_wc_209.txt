<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned as "quietly driven" trait isn't tested under pressure. Cost of artistic shift remains vague despite visible change in mural style.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (relinquishing vibrant style for contemplative art), but lens ambiguity lingers—Accumulative/Textural drive isn't fully taught until midway cathedral scenes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and postcards function as micro-setting, constraining Luna's tactile exploration ("fingers tracing lines") and charging the final image as "treasured keepsake," though autumn setting remains decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density (layered glass patterns reweighting her perception), but escalation lacks visible cost—artistic transformation feels frictionless despite "umbral tenderness" as conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from moonlight/flower motifs, but final paragraph's explicit "secrets of flowers" statement edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory details ("whispering forests," "etched glass glinting"), yet repeated abstract phrases like "dawning hush" dilute POV consistency during high-pressure reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Beautiful cadence falters with paraphrase loops ("umbral tenderness" x3) and therapy-speak labels; "hush was not just absence of sound" exemplifies overwrought abstraction in peak transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-science spirituality avoids cliché through specific "etched glass" mechanics, but risks muted by safe lyrical convention—no bold structural deviation to heighten stakes beyond expected epiphany arc.</comment>
