<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks interior contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; observation replaces agency. No visible cost when figures resume conversation undermines Earned Stasis potential despite warm observation motif.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Closure fails Cost Proof test: figures' resolution carries no legible cost or reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds but closure unit (dawn arrival) lacks conceptual/social cost or stance crystallization despite Charged Poise attempt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto setting vividly constrains attention through starlight/shadow interplay, with jade cicada functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image via tactile recurrence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: "tension" between figures never materializes into dramatic pressure. Stakes remain abstract ("texture of time") without narrowing options or visible trade-offs during the pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition periods emerges organically through cicada/starlight motifs but final image lacks resonant answer to central question; dawn arrival feels like resolution rather than reweighted cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "warmly observant" filtering; rhythmic control sustains textural density. No head-hopping despite dual focal points (chronicler/figures) through consistent spatial anchoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" repetition creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats; minor scaffold in contemplative passages. No closure-dulling artifacts but cadence lacks peak-beat compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Specific grotto/cicada details avoid generic lyricism, but transformation of "transition periods" concept feels familiar. Emotional truth in stillness lacks bold risk-taking to elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
