<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied contradiction; "thoughtfully precise" trait remains descriptive without constraining choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No legible cost anchors closure; "weight of exile lifting" contradicts promised stakes, violating Q2's cost proof test where final image lacks visible sacrifice for renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting functions decoratively; "magnetic nexus" and basalt dent lack causal pressure despite vivid twilight descriptions, failing Q3's 9+ gate requiring environment to constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("discover beauty") without on-page testing; no escalation or tightening occurs as contemplation replaces meaningful pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates finale ("guided by light of inner truth"), triggering Q5's -0.7 penalty for explicit moralizing that replaces earned resonance with platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice shows rhythmic control in sensory descriptions but overuses filter phrases ("he felt") that dull immediacy during high-pressure reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence ("he felt... he recalled...") and mixed metaphor ("silence palpable, a living entity") create paraphrase loops that obscure causal progression in key moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Derivative exile archetype lacks fresh inflection; "magnetic nexus" feels like forced novelty without transforming familiar redemption tropes through specific lived detail.</comment>
