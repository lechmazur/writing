<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Student's motivation ("secrets of old buildings") lacks contradictory impulses; whispered confession shows curiosity but no embodied conflict like clutching the seal while hesitating. Tutor's interiority remains observational, missing flaws that complicate choices. Sugar-to-tea backstory hints at organic relationship growth but doesn't alter present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("never see the world the same way again"), but meteor shower's fading feels coincidental rather than pressure-driven escalation under accumulative lens. Interrogation beat lacks sufficient buildup—student's answer flows too easily without complicating the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden's meteor shower and blooming flowers create vivid atmosphere but remain ornamental; they don't constrain choices (e.g., no wind disrupting the seal). Antique desk seal functions as micro-setting that charges closure through its "weight of history" and "otherworldly light" reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("understanding building secrets") is signaled early but never tested—interrogation beat lacks escalation as student answers without resistance. No trade-offs or visible cost beyond abstract worldview shift; "agreed upon lies" concept shapes dialogue but doesn't alter tactics during the session.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of "agreed upon lies" emerges organically through the seal metaphor, but tutor's final line about "secrets hidden in plain sight" risks thematic echo. Saved by the glowing seal's final image, which reweights the concept with conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV maintains stable perceptual signature ("nimble fingers tracing," "scent of blooming flowers"), but stress moments lack diction compression—e.g., interrogation stays lyrical without shifting rhythm. Student's dialogue feels generic, missing distinct voice quirks that would heighten subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("words flowing like a river") serves accumulative pressure without muddle. Final line's "sound of the stars" risks purple prose but fits voice-driven rhythm. Minor near-miss: "weaving a spell of mysterious familiarity" slightly strains metaphor but redeems through context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms mentor-student trope through specific details (dead languages of buildings, seal as physical metaphor), avoiding sentimentality. Fresh angle on language shaping perception, but "secrets" stakes feel abstract without concrete cost manifestation beyond the student's realization.</comment>
