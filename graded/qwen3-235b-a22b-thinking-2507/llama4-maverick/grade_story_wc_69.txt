<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("pang of nostalgia," "sense of determination") without embodied contradiction; "expectantly resigned" trait remains untested in action. Final endurance lacks visible cost beyond stated weight of task, failing micro-choice escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "determination" resolve, but cost ("weight of task") remains conceptual not felt; Accumulative lens holds yet lacks meaningful deepening—pressure never tightens beyond initial reflection. No tangible escalation narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (stained glass, zither craftsmanship) anchor setting early, yet environment functions as static backdrop. Velvet library/rosette never constrain choices or charge final image—micro-setting potential wasted despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlearning hatred through music) signaled early but remains abstract; zero escalation as pressure coheres only in reflection. No tightening of options or on-page cost—Emilia's resolve emerges from thought, not dramatized trade-offs or narrowing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Theme explicitly moralized in final paragraph ("testament to power of music"), triggering -0.7 Thematic Echo penalty. Vanishing arts concept stated but never dramatized through character struggle; unity message lacks ambiguity or earned complexity beyond sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV consistent but voice drowns in lyrical clichés ("kaleidoscope of colors," "traveled stillness"). Filter-verb saturation ("Emilia felt," "she felt") erodes immediacy; no perceptual signature—Emilia notices generic "sensitive artist" tropes, not character-particular details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Prose artifact cascade: paraphrase loops ("traveled stillness"/"traversed vast distances"), template cadence ("As she [verb]..."), and therapy-speak labels ("sense of longing") in peak beats. Final image dulled by "beacon of hope" cliché; filter-verb stack disqualifies 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Trope-bound synthesis: choir teacher + vanishing arts lacks fresh inflection. "Traveled stillness" and autumn-library aesthetic feel curated not earned; transformation test fails—swap "zither" for "piano" and nothing changes. Safe middle-ground hedging.</comment>
