<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "cautious enchantment" repeats as label without embodied struggle. Motivation for rebuilding is clear but untested by concrete obstacles, flattening earned change. Micro-choices absent under pressure—excavation feels meditative rather than fraught.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: "sense of pride" isn't a felt sacrifice. Orientation succeeds early, but Accumulative lens falters as pressure never tightens—no narrowing of options or deepening stakes. Cost proof test fails; no on-page image concretizes loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp earth, snaking roots) are vivid and POV-filtered, but catacomb orchard remains atmospheric backdrop. Setting doesn't constrain choices or charge closure—bones/trees are observed, not leveraged. Micro-setting (sundial) lacks causal role despite recurrence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("restore lost faith") stay abstract without concrete test. Zero escalation: excavation progresses smoothly with no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. Agency is passive discovery, not active choice under pressure. Dominant stake signaled but never pressured, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (sundial, bones), but final paragraph moralizes: "rebuild something within herself... sense of faith." Violates organic emergence rule—Thematic Echo penalty applies for stated moral replacing earned resonance in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight filtered through canopy," "air heavy with scent") with rhythmic control. Consistent first-person limited POV; no head-hopping. "Purposeful wandering" recurs with intentional modulation. Minor register drift in "cautious enchantment" but elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but "cautious enchantment" repeats as scaffold, dulling closure. Filter verbs ("Maya felt") accumulate in high-pressure beats without payoff. Final line resonant but overwriting slightly obscures cost legibility. No template cadence, but density falters in emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Diaspora returnee trope transformed via catacomb orchard specificity, but emotional arc lacks risk—rediscovery feels inevitable without struggle. "Cautious enchantment" concept fresh but execution avoids bold stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: swap names/places and arc works unchanged.</comment>
