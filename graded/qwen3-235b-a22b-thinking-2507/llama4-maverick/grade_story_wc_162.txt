<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in father's legacy but "featherly determined" is diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied emotion in prism interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with father's reappearance reconfiguring "necessary distances," but the cost ("weight of my quest") remains abstract rather than legible in final action/image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace actively constrains navigation ("colors bleeding like watercolors"), with logbook weather code charging the final image; sensory details reflect child's disorientation without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) tightens through logbook decoding, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; father's resolution borders on coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from "necessary distances" as spiritual/physical duality, but final moralizing ("world of wonder and awe") risks sentimentality despite strong motif integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wood-grain analysis; rhythmic control during prism shifts avoids syntactic monotony, though reflection fragments slightly dilute present-moment urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwritten sensory density ("shattered light danced... otherworldly glow") in opening beats creates paraphrase loops; "fractured hush" repetition dulls momentum without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth trope through prism physics and weather-code logic, but "sacred thresholds" concept leans on familiar spiritual jargon without sufficiently fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
