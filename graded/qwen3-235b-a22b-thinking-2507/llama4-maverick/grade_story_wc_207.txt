<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; "sensibly eccentric" trait remains label-only without constraining actions. Diagnostic phrase "hinged awakenings" triggers -0.4 penalty during pivotal threshold moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks visible cost: becoming "one with the lagoon" offers transcendence without sacrifice. No legible price paid for reaching "where explanations fail" despite Q2's cost-proof requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Luminescent fungi and petrichor create vivid atmosphere, but subterranean lagoon never pressures choices—she walks freely into water. Micro-setting potential of compass wasted as passive plot device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("find where explanations fail") remain abstract; no narrowing of options or tangible cost. Trepidation stated but not embodied—escalation lacks agency-driven tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Place where explanations fail" hammered too directly in paragraph 3, triggering thematic echo penalty. Final image reweights premise well but lacks the 9+ quick test's non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct "resonant hush" refrain creates perceptual signature, though filter-verbs dilute immediacy during compass vision. Rhythmic control maintains voice coherence through mystical climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Synonym churn ("intricate engravings and delicate needle") and scaffold loops in climax ("felt herself becoming one with..."). Filter-verb stacks in final third trigger -0.5 penalty disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Petrichor collector concept fresh but "compass to mystical grotto" trope-heavy. Derivative premise guardrail applies—transformation insufficient to distinguish from standard transcendence narratives.</comment>
