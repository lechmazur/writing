<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("voice of the unknown") is clear but underdeveloped; no contradictory impulses shown during pressure moments. Final choice lacks earned causality—contentment arrives without visible struggle against prior fears. Diagnostic label "desire to become the voice" triggers penalty in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) fails cost proof test: "darkness was no longer daunting" states rather than shows cost. Accumulative lens holds, but final image lacks undeniable pressure—contentment washes over her without tangible sacrifice. Missing on-page cost legibility caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent fungi and salt scents create strong atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices—Aria navigates effortlessly. Fossil’s glow at closure lacks specificity to charge the final image; misses 9+ gate requirement for environment/object constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: abstract stakes ("uncover mysteries") face no concrete pressure. Darkness "pressing in" resolves instantly via wonder, with zero trade-offs. Under Accumulative lens, density never increases—sensory details repeat without pattern break or cost reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Explicit thematic echo ruins resonance: "she had found her voice" states the moral in final paragraph. Transitional objects concept remains abstract—fossil’s "pulse" lacks earned meaning shift. Avoids sentimentality but fails organic emergence through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive syntax ("Aria felt...") creates drumbeat rhythm under pressure. "Factually mystical" violates POV lexicon with corporate diction. Filter-verb stack ("felt herself float... carried... pulled") dulls immediacy in high-stakes mapping sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague momentum: "full of secrets... still much to discover" then "mysteries... ready to uncover." Final beat’s filter-verb stack ("felt a sense... felt a deep sense...") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. Template cadence in exploration beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory mapping trope executed competently but without fresh angle—heat-mapping feels like tech jargon slapped onto mystical concept. Avoids middle-ground hedging but lacks risk; emotional specificity remains generic ("wonder," "contentment").</comment>
