<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("calm defiance," "encrypt vulnerability as strength") without embodied contradiction; Aria’s motivation lacks friction—no visible struggle between code-breaking urgency and dance compulsion weakens causal drive toward closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the escape into light, but cost remains nebulous—no tangible price (time lost, emotional toll) is legible on the page despite the spider’s web completion, undermining escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like saltwater decay anchor atmosphere effectively, yet the sunken lab functions as generic backdrop; the spider’s web charges the final image but never constrains Aria’s choices (e.g., no time-driven tactical shifts), missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes narrow subtly as the spider weaves, but escalation lacks visible cost—Aria’s liberation feels unearned as no prior sacrifice (e.g., journal risks, dance-induced delays) alters her tactics or deepens pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming vulnerability into strength resonates via the dice’s symbolic shift, yet explicit statements ("encrypt her vulnerability as strength") override earned subtext; the final web image hints at complexity but avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective sensory bias (dice/web focus), but filter verbs ("Aria felt," "she sensed") dilute immediacy during high-pressure beats like the dance sequence, slightly muddying focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Repetitive scaffold ("mysterious familiarity" twice, verbatim "scent of saltwater" recurrence) creates paraphrase loops; while rhythm supports mood, these artifacts dull closure momentum without pattern-teaching payoff in the escape beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dance-as-code-expression offers fresh inflection, yet synthesis feels underdeveloped—trapped-codebreaker tropes aren’t sufficiently transformed by specific stakes (e.g., journal mechanics lack verisimilitude), avoiding middle-ground hedging but not transcending convention.</comment>
