<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("heart filled with pride") without embodied contradiction; "calmly inventive" trait is label-only with no tradeoffs under pressure. Flaws lack visible consequences as sentinel executes perfect choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—final "road ahead fraught with danger" is abstract telling, not dramatized consequence. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof fails per Q2 gate test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Vivid twilight/fort imagery functions as backdrop but doesn't constrain choices; cradle's light charges the ending image yet environment remains decorative rather than tactical. Misses 9+ gate for active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes (revolution) are declared but never tested through concrete trade-offs; blackout serves as catalyst without tightening decisions. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "symbol of courage" and "darkness vanquished" moralize rather than emerge from particulars. Final paragraph violates Q5 policy with explicit moralizing (-0.8).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwritten cadence ("the sentinel...") and filter verbs ("knew," "realized") dull immediacy; all characters share identical elevated diction. Register drift into revolutionary jargon breaks POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: 65%+ sentences use stacked modifiers/metaphors in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("As she...") and paraphrase loops ("darkness vanquished") in final third trigger -1.7 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Revolution trope with generic symbols (cradle/quill); "winking hush" feels like forced quirk. Derivative premise without transformation per Derivative Premise Guardrail (-0.9).</comment>
