<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion in drumming but "periodically eternal" is diagnostic label-speak violating POV plausibility; motivation to discover path disappearances lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle during key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—"truth not in maps but rhythms" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase; pressure plateaus without meaningful deepening past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drum functions as micro-setting that constrains Maya's coping method and charges the final image ("rhythm echoing across water"), though station backdrop remains atmospheric rather than tactically pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding path disappearances) signaled early but fails to tighten options; realization shifts perspective without altering tactics, violating Accumulative escalation requirement for pattern break that reweights cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through drum rhythms versus data, with final image ("rhythm a beacon") offering non-literal answer to central question, though "periodically eternal" strains credibility as earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice shows strong perceptual signature in ocean details but "periodically eternal" breaks POV plausibility with abstract jargon; consistent third-limited perspective avoids head-hopping yet lacks rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Beautiful imagery undermined by template cadence ("Maya's gaze... Maya's thoughts...") and stock phrase "periodically eternal" in peak beat; no closure-adjacent loops but scaffold weakens momentum in middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate recovery through rhythmic listening avoids tropes, though "coral bleaching witness" role lacks transformation; emotional specificity elevates premise but doesn't reach risk-distinction threshold for 9+ band.</comment>
