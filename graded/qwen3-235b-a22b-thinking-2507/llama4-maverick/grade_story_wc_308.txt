<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete interiority; "pulse" and "resolve" are abstract labels without embodied conflict or micro-choices. No contradictory impulses under pressure—only serene observation. "Weathered resolve" stated but not dramatized through specific actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "pulse synchronizing" is vague, not a felt/conceptual price. Orientation debt resolved by payoff (canyon hum central to closure), but accumulation fails to tighten stakes—dust layers without altering skimmer’s static tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting details ("towers of bone," dust) are vivid but decorative; no constraint on choices or closure charge. Arrowhead recurs but functions as thematic symbol only—never handled or altering tactics. Sensory checklist (wings, tremors) lacks urgency-driven selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("navigate without moving") remains abstract; no escalation under Accumulative lens. Dust/time vague, not a live clock tightening decisions. Pulse resolution lacks trade-offs—synchronization feels unearned, with no visible price paid to foreclose paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("reminder that even in stillness...") violates Q5 penalty rules. Abstract "secrets of the universe" conclusion replaces earned resonance with moralizing. Arrowhead’s transformation into a "key" lacks concrete particulars, reducing theme to platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV voice lacks perceptual signature—repetitive "The skimmer’s..." cadence creates template monotony. No modulation under pressure; serene tone remains static despite "pulse" tension. Elevated diction ("vibrational hum") feels authorial, not skimmer-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Template cadence ("The skimmer’s...") and "as the dust continued to fall" repetition trigger scaffold penalties. Final-third artifacts ("pulse... now a part of the skimmer") dull closure. Abstract labels ("weathered resolve") replace concrete propulsion, harming momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Derivative canyon/arrowhead tropes lack transformation; "towers of bone" feels generic. Emotional truth absent—skimmer’s "journey" resolves too neatly. No fresh inflection; relies on poetic abstraction rather than specific lived detail to anchor universals.</comment>
