<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (science/mysticism) stated but not embodied through micro-choices; "diagnostic label-speak" ("luminous skeptic," "futuristic nostalgia") replaces concrete contradiction in peak beats. Final choice lacks visible trade-off between values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "futuristic nostalgia" is abstract, not felt/conceptual price. Orientation clear early but climax fails cost proof test—no on-page sentence anchors sacrifice for her paradigm shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lavender bluff/aurora vivid but static backdrop; ring functions as passive plot device without constraining choices. Micro-setting (taste sensing) abandoned after setup, failing to charge final image or alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (science vs. mysticism) signaled early but pressure never tightens—forest elections add texture without complicating choices. No visible price paid for her shift; "futuristic nostalgia" is thematic abstraction, not earned cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme stated directly in final paragraph ("magic waiting to be discovered"), violating organic emergence. Pseudo-profundity ("futuristic nostalgia") replaces earned resonance; thematic echo in closure triggers -0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct sensory prose but POV leaks ("trees were said to hold elections") and inconsistent perceptual signature. Stress compression fails—elevated diction persists during climax ("spectral light," "terrestrially cosmic forces").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("Aria felt... Aria sensed... Aria knew") and abstract modifiers ("ethereal glow," "futuristic nostalgia") dull closure. Paraphrase loop: "subtle forces"/"subtle changes" in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Familiar skeptic-to-believer arc with ornamental details (forest elections, taste sensing) that don't transform premise. "Terrestrially cosmic" jargon feels tacked on; fails transformation test—replace "lavender bluff" and story unchanged.</comment>
