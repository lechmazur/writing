<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("tension between nostalgia and innovation") lacks embodied micro-choices; actions remain observational rather than pressured decisions under stakes. "Shrewdly innocent gaze" feels label-driven without concrete manifestation in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("no longer held back by doubts") under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure accumulates without narrowing options. Final image reconfigures stakes but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Secret garden functions as atmospheric backdrop but fails to constrain choices or charge closure; sensory details remain decorative ("vibrant flowers," "soothing sounds") without affecting Emilia’s decisions. No object or environment actively pressures the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking clarity amid uncertainty) signaled early but lacks escalation—pressure never tightens options or forces trade-offs. "Cleft in certainty" deepens internal conflict but doesn’t alter tactics; cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme ("turn mistakes into constellations") emerges through motif but suffers from thematic echo in final paragraph’s explicit moralizing ("testament to transformative power"). Lacks resonant, non-literal answer to central question due to stated resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyrical prose ("cleft in certainty," "dynamic balance"), but register drifts into abstract diction ("conceptual repricing," "resonant reconfiguration") during peak reflection, violating POV plausibility for a bone-setter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("feeling a sense of wonder... tranquil atmosphere"; "sense of clarity... sense of purpose"). Template cadence in "As she stood there..." clusters weaken propulsion in high-pressure beats near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with bone-setting artistry shows ingenuity, but "turn mistakes into constellations" relies on familiar metaphor without transformative specificity. Avoids safety-middle yet derivative in emotional arc resolution.</comment>
