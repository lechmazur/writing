<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; grief remains abstract "bittersweet ache" without embodied struggle. Diagnostic label-speak ("nameless fears") triggers penalty. Final endurance lacks visible cost beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("echo of sacrifice"), but cost proof weakens impact—no specific image where sacrifice's price crystallizes beyond vague "melancholy longing." Accumulative lens holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Observatory/atlas provide vivid texture, but micro-setting fails: atlas page inspires without constraining choices (e.g., no torn edge affecting crystallization). Final "relic" image charges theme but misses 9+ gate requirement for tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("nameless fears") remains abstract; crystallization faces no opposition or cost escalation. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks agency-driven deepening—reaper's action changes nothing tangible, violating "forecloses a path" band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea monster echoes, but final paragraph moralizes ("power of sacrifice, enduring legacy") with Thematic Echo penalty. Avoids tidy resolution but "echo of sacrifice" repetition undermines organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystalline glow" and "misty apparitions," yet uniform cadence under stress ("a sense of...", "haunting melody") flattens emotional escalation. No head-hopping, but psychic distance never compresses during high-pressure crystallization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in final beats ("sense of melancholy longing"/"sense of peace"); template cadence ("As the...") weakens propulsion. Filter-verb stack ("began to emanate... started to crystallize") dulls immediacy in closure beat, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms reaper trope through melancholic lyricism, but "echoes of sacrifice" concept feels familiar. Emotional truth elevates premise, yet lacks fresh inflection—crystallization mechanic lacks distinctive rules to heighten stakes.</comment>
