<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied sorrow (tears falling while reading letters) but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear yet static without micro-choices under pressure during the box opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when recluse internalizes the unspoken words ("weight now part of their being"), crystallizing refusal to let memories die with visible emotional cost in the tearful reading sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned oasis constrains choice: grime-muted stained glass box demands cleaning/reverence, while decaying hives and ghosts charge the final image of memory as "beacon in darkness," fulfilling 9+ gate via setting-as-tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) tightens when ghosts stir during reading, but "tangled covenant" remains abstract thematic weight rather than operational pressure; cost is felt but not tied to concrete trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through letters/ghosts, but final moralizing ("reminder that even in desolate worlds...") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undercutting earned resonance with overt assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory filtering ("air reeked of decay," "faint hum filled the air"), though "tranquilly perceptive eyes" drifts into abstract labeling under peak stress during box opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythm ("sun dipped below horizon... warm golden light") but paraphrase loops ("gaze lingered"/"gaze fell"/"gaze never wavered") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy during the box-opening sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beekeeping lore with post-apocalyptic grief avoids tropes, yet "tangled covenant" concept lacks specific transformation, leaning on generic "secrecy and deceit" without unique moral calculus.</comment>
