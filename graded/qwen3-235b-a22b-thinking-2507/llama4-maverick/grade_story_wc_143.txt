<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; "purposefully curious" is label-only with no tradeoffs. Final endurance lacks visible struggle or cost escalation. Diagnostic phrasing ("bittersweet reminder") undermines embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works (enduring to capture images), but Patel's warning creates no meaningful pressure escalation. Cost remains abstract "melancholy" without concrete on-page price paid during the mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moonlit summit functions as micro-setting via the hourglass grain charging the final image. But "space age" timeframe lacks causal pressure, and environmental details rarely constrain choices beyond generic "harsh conditions" mentions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (documenting vanishing flora) is clear early, but "outlast" action faces no tangible opposition. Lunar conditions remain atmospheric rather than forcing tactical adaptations, missing band guardrail for visible price altering choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges through flora/hourglass, but final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("preciousness of life"), triggering thematic echo penalty. Lacks non-literal resonant answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong lunar-specific diction but filter-verb stacks ("her gaze scanning," "eyes were fixed") dull immediacy. Register drift occurs when technical role clashes with poetic abstractions like "dawning hush" in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in opening ("As the moon... As she raised... As the first light") creates rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops ("stillness... palpable, a dawning hush") and final-third repetition of "dawnlit" disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Hourglass grain offers fresh inflection, but lunar conservation premise feels derivative. Lacks bold risk-taking; emotional specificity avoids generic templates yet tropes aren't sufficiently transformed through character-specific choices.</comment>
