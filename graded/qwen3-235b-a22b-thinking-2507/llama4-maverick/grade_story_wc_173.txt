<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes") without embodied contradiction. Transformation lacks visible struggle—threads unravel smoothly with no resistance or cost, making epiphany unearned. "Bodily poetic form" appears as decorative phrase rather than trait influencing action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands under Accumulative lens but cost remains abstract—"fading echoes" lacks palpable consequence. No visible price paid for transformation; prism glow resolves tension without narrowing options. "Time it took was brief" undermines escalation, violating pressure coherence for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Snow setting provides atmospheric texture ("ground crunched beneath her feet") but never constrains choices or charges closure. Prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting yet its mechanics remain vague—no tangible interaction beyond reflection. "Silver courtyard" stays generic backdrop despite lyrical description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("defy lullaby of conformity") stay abstractly declared without concrete test. Pressure accumulates through metaphor density but lacks meaningful tightening—threads untangle effortlessly with no escalating resistance. Final transformation forecloses no live option; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through thread/prism motifs until final paragraph's thematic echo: "reminder of the power of defiance" states the moral directly. This violates Q5's penalty rule for final-paragraph moralizing, undermining earned resonance. Earlier subtext ("bittersweet harvest") shows stronger integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice shines in snow imagery ("delicate flakes danced") with consistent perceptual bias toward light. However, peak stress moments ("surge of energy... exhilarating and terrifying") maintain uniform elevated diction without compression, missing opportunity for voice modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Final paragraph contains paraphrase loop: "reminder of the power... beauty of being true to oneself" followed by "no longer a call to conformity." This scaffold dulls closure impact per Q7's loop screen. "Alarming serenity" feels like forced lyricism rather than character-particular observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise (breaking societal constraints) remains archetypal without fresh inflection—swap "courtesan" for "nun" with minimal edits. Prism sanctuary offers novelty but lacks specificity; transformation mechanics feel template-like. No bold risk-taking that heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
