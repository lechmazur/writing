<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; "rejects false comfort" is stated but not dramatized through micro-choices. Alchemist's resolve remains unchallenged, lacking the inevitable mistakes or genuine struggle required for higher bands. The "weight of task" feels abstract rather than embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of task"), but cost proof fails: "feeling the weight settle" is vague without concrete legibility. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet pressure lacks measurable intensification beyond atmospheric shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (paper lanterns, decay scent) anchor atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices. The amber bottle’s "shifting patterns" charge mood without altering tactics, missing the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes (reviving civilization) are clear but static; escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options. The "daunting task" declaration never faces concrete on-page complication, failing to reweight the dominant stake through earned pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth emerges organically through "ashes of the old" imagery without moralizing. Final image ("new civilization born from ashes") resonates as a non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in alchemist’s historical reconstruction ("light danced through streets"), with rhythmic control modulating calm contemplation to dawn resolve. No head-hopping; voice stays anchored in working-memory focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "mind consumed by the task" followed by "goal was not... but to conceive" creates slight redundancy. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "fierce intensity/fierce determination" repetition edges toward lexical illusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemy framework transforms ghost-town revival through specific "working memory" mechanics and the amber bottle’s paradox (potential without opening). Risk-taking in quiet closure elevates stakes without gimmickry, though premise edges close to familiar tropes.</comment>
