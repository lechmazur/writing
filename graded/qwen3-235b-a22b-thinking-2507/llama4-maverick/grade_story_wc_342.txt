<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "noble and quixotic" motivation shines, but embodied emotion lacks specificity beyond "unsettling sense"; micro-choices like detecting coin patterns reveal craft-focused values without deeper flaw exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with "fleeting instant of beauty that would soon be lost," but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Hybrid) prevents 8.8+; demolition clock tightens stakes sufficiently though causal links feel thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tree trunk library constrains choice (canvas propped against trunk) and charges final image ("sky mirrored within walls"), though occupational details like "scholar's guild" lack causal pressure; sensory dappled light anchors atmosphere vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing essence before demolition) tightens meaningfully as coin's patterns guide brushstrokes, but escalation relies on internal realization rather than protagonist agency; cost ("fleeting beauty lost") feels earned yet slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of "futility seeking infinite within finite bounds" emerges organically through coin's indentations and portrait, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights transience without stating morals, though "limits discovered" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "trained eyes detected" tactile details, but "hush of pre-demolition stillness" slips into generic lyricism; rhythmic control wavers during reflection blocks though compression serves atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fractally precise renderings" risks thesaurus-itis but pays off in motif; minor scaffold in "faint, swirling patterns... faint indentations" causes slight redundancy, though final image's propulsion ("glow with otherworldly light") rescues closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blindness with sky-mirroring creates organic tension, but "condemned library" trope lacks transformation; specificity in coin's topography elevates beyond template, though demolition trope limits risk distinction.</comment>
