<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("mission to capture the sound of trust breaking") dominates peak beats without embodied cost, undermining motivation. Contradictory impulses absent; Lena's flawless composure during confrontation lacks character-specific struggle despite stated "unease."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no on-page evidence for "at what cost?" beyond abstraction. Two non-closure issues (vague cost + no persistent constraint) trigger -1.5 cap. Orientation solid but causality falters as sunrise resolves tension coincidentally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (rotting pier, moonshine) anchor atmosphere early, but setting remains decorative backdrop. Pirate market exerts zero pressure on choices; recurring watch fob charges closure yet fails to constrain any action mid-scene per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Lena observes rather than acts. Sunrise coincidence resolves tension, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve." No visible price paid for "success," failing band guardrail for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Thematic Echo dominates final paragraph ("power of determination and secrets"), triggering -0.6 penalty. Theme stated via abstraction ("sound of trust breaking") rather than earned through concrete action; no resonant non-literal answer emerges from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric voice initially degrades under pressure—Lena's perfect articulation during confrontation ("I know what you're trying to do") contradicts established "comforting unease" as therapy-speak. Perceptual signature erodes with generic stress responses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Template cadence proliferates in climax ("Lena took a step... her voice... Lena's hand..."), while abstract phrases ("truce of hush," "sound of trust breaking") muddle meaning. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+; density issues trigger -0.7 deduction for figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Derivative premise (pirate market moonshine runner) lacks transformation—tropes remain generic. No fresh inflection beyond surface details; emotional specificity sacrificed to atmospheric clichés ("comforting unease"). Guardrail -0.8 for untransformed template.</comment>
