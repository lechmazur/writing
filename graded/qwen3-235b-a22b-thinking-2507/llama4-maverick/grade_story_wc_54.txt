<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("equations for hope") without embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure during pipe rerouting. Diagnostic label-speak in peak beats ("deeper truth") lacks visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: terminal restoration succeeds effortlessly with no legible sacrifice. "Gleaming surfaces" imply effort but omit specific cost, invalidating Charged Poise under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but static; rusting pipes enable action without constraining choices. Final glow lacks specificity—no tool/environment reweights closure beyond generic rebirth imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No escalation: maze "shifts like a living thing" but presents zero obstacles. Stakes remain abstract ("rebirth") without narrowing options or felt trade-offs during restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("reminder that even darkest times...") replaces earned resonance. Explicit moralizing undercuts Accumulative closure; no non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice lacks perceptual signature—descriptions feel omniscient ("Maya's mind began to wander"). "Stoic wonder" tone static, never modulating under pressure despite maze's "shifting" threat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Maya's [noun] [verb]ed") repeats 5x; paraphrase loops ("dusty surfaces gleaming"/"terminal transformed"). Minor but pervasive momentum drag in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Derivative premise (abandoned place reborn via mystical artifact) lacks fresh synthesis. Sextant's "guiding" influence feels like trope recycling without specific lived detail.</comment>
