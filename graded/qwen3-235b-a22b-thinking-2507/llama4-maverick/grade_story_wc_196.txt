<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transformation from broken-hearted to purposeful lacks contradictory impulses; "mending heart" is told not shown. No visible cost to her archival choice undermines Earned Stasis. Micro-choices absent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands ("sanctuary of remembrance") but cost remains abstract ("quiet hope"). Orientation test fails: "emancipation" backstory unanchored past 120 words. Accumulative lens holds weakly without density shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting charging closure, but file room details never constrain choices. Sensory specificity (musty air, button's glint) vivid yet static—environment doesn't evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: stakes remain abstract ("magnify kindnesses") with zero opposition. Button discovery lacks tightening—no trade-offs or narrowed options. Cost proof test fails; no legible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("testament to resilience") states moral outright. Theme emerges from particulars but sermonizing ("enduring power of human heart") replaces earned resonance. No conceptual repricing of "unknown histories."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dust patterns, tactile archiving) shines early but collapses into abstraction. Register drift in climax ("enduring power of human heart") violates Emilia's plausible lexicon. Consistent psychic distance otherwise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Multiple scaffold loops ("the more... the more...") and filter verbs ("Emilia's eyes wandered") dull key beats. Final paragraph's thesaurus churn ("unassuming thing that unfolded like a flower") obscures closure image. Strong opening rhythm degrades.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Familiar archivist trope + found object lacks fresh inflection. "Dust patterns" detail feels organic but doesn't transform premise. Avoids safety middle yet derivative in emotional arc—no bold risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
