<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains intellectualized; no contradictory impulses shown under pressure as Elian monolithically pursues "whispers travel farther." "Screaming tenderness" reads as therapy-speak label without embodied cost, triggering diagnostic penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dawn realization) lacks visible cost legibility; "indelible mark on soul" is abstract. Accumulative lens holds but cost proof fails—no exact image showing paid price. Orientation anchors early but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting: pruning/watering actions constrain Elian's dawn ritual and charge the final "scent of garden at night" callback. Sensory specificity (blooming flowers, fresh earth) filters through his caretaker POV without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("prove whispers travel farther") with no tangible pressure escalation. The "vibrations" intensify only through telling ("energy build and swirl"), never testing commitment via concrete trade-offs. Dominant stake signaled early but lacks deepening with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo destroys resonance: Elian explicitly states "whispers travel farther than shouts" verbatim, triggering -0.8 penalty. Theme reduces to simplistic binary with no ambiguity; "screaming tenderness" offers no non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "intoxicating aroma," "cobalt lighthouse" lexicon. Rhythmic control falters in climax ("screaming tenderness that threatened to overwhelm him") where stress should compress diction, not inflate abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague key beats: "calm wash over him" followed by "feeling the calm," "fruits of his labor" echoed in "intoxicating aroma." Filter-verb stacks ("feeling the purifying power... feeling himself attuned") dull climax momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tropes (lighthouse mysticism, vial symbolism) remain generic despite lyrical execution. "Vibrations of intent" offers no fresh inflection—feels like repackaged New Age abstraction. Emotional truth sacrificed to poetic vagueness ("screaming tenderness").</comment>
