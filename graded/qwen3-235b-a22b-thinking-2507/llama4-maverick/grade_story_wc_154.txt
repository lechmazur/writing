<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "shared anxieties" and "lotus-hearted ache" risk diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices like cast decryption earn credibility, though the final peace shift lacks concrete physical manifestation of cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: coral's glow crystallizes options with felt cost ("aching but hopeful"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through decryption sequence, but the anesthetic's role in enabling closure slightly softens the cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist and coral function as micro-setting that charges the final image; "smudged notes" on the cast concretely constrain decryption choices, though twilight's role remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through coral/cast decryption, narrowing options to internal reframing; the "lotus-hearted ache" embodies cost, but the anesthetic's passive role slightly dilutes protagonist agency in the pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral/cast particulars without moralizing; the final coral image resonates as non-literal answer to "shared anxieties," though "lotus-hearted" phrasing borders on thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent wonder," translator's pattern-seeking); rhythmic control deepens under stress, though "lotus-hearted ache" momentarily fractures lexicon plausibility for a translator mid-anesthetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density in coral/cast descriptions. Minor register drift in "lotus-hearted ache" (academic diction) risks overwriting in high-pressure beat, but rhythm variations sustain propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing object" trope via coral's scientific fragility; "decrypting smudged cast notes" as anxiety reframing feels fresh. Avoids safety-middle by embracing ambiguous peace without tidy resolution.</comment>
