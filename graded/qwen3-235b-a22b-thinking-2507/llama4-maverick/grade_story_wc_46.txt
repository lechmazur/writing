<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; motivation clear but lacks embodied struggle. "Pearl of stillness" treated as abstract concept rather than visceral need, with no visible cost to endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands ("heart remained still"), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Accumulative lens holds, yet escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift—polishing process repeats without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto mist and sea glass constrain choice (polishing under low light) and charge the final image. Sensory details like "damp earth" and "gem dust" reflect star watcher's priorities, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing stillness) never faces concrete test. Pressure stalls at "weigh significance" without narrowing options; polishing repetitions lack causal escalation or trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass transformation, but "pearl of stillness" is overtly stated rather than earned. Final image reweights tranquility as shared beacon, yet avoids meaningful ambiguity or counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bubbles rising to pond surface") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; mist refracts POV bias consistently. Minor register drift with "reflectively vibrant" as clinical term.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in luminescence descriptions ("soft, inner light... gentle light beacon") trigger -0.3. Strong propulsion otherwise, but "zephyr bloom" repetition dulls closure image without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Derivative New Age tropes ("pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom") lack fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality, yet premise mirrors generic mindfulness narratives without transformative stakes.</comment>
