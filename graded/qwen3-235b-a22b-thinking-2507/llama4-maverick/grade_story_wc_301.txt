<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but diagnostic label-speak ("forgiveness was not a destination, but a path") undermines embodied emotion in peak beats; contradictory impulses present yet closure choice lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ongoing journey), but cost legibility falters—exact moment of sacrifice ("weight of secrets lifted") feels abstract rather than viscerally earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-covered station and patched accordion bellows powerfully constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "damp earth and decaying leaves" evolve with emotional urgency without static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (self-forgiveness quest), but escalation lacks tangible pressure—medication withdrawal’s "hidden patterns" remain observational, never forcing concrete trade-offs or tactical shifts under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through river/graffiti motifs, but final paragraph’s "forgiveness was a journey, not a destination" crosses into thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance with near-prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("truth-seeking river chronicler" lens) and rhythmic control shine, though "began to allude" and similar filter verbs momentarily dilute immediacy during high-pressure music sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("mended and broken" repeated verbatim) and filter-verb clusters ("her eyes wandered," "thoughts turned") in critical beats dull momentum without payoff pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicler + accordionist avoids tropes, yet emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution ("heart felt lighter") without sufficient friction against Elara’s established guilt complexity.</comment>
