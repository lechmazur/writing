<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Akira's motivation is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; her flawlessness undermines depth as no blind spots complicate choices. Interiority relies on generic labels like "heart full of hope" without embodied struggle under sanctions pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the bell's final chime crystallizing resilience, but cost remains abstract—no visible price paid on the page for sanctions endurance. Orientation anchors early but cost proof fails; cannot point to exact sentence where cost manifests.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("scent of blooming flowers," "terra-cotta arbor") create atmosphere but setting functions as backdrop, not constraint. Micro-setting (silver bell) charges closure yet environment never pressures choices or alters tactics during the meeting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sanctions establish stakes but pressure never tightens; Akira's declaration lacks escalation as no reversal tests commitment. Dominant stake remains abstract—no on-page narrowing of options or tangible cost (e.g., dwindling supplies) to drive meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through community actions, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet "resilience as beacon" borders on thematic echo when Akira declares "we will emerge stronger," risking prompt-like language that slightly undercuts earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable with lyrical consistency, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—details like "warm orange glow" feel curated, not filtered through Akira's urgent priorities. Emotional descriptions ("spirit renewed") default to generic phrasing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with rhythmic control yet minor synonym loops dilute impact: "soft chime"/"gentle hum"/"soft rustle" risk textural redundancy. No closure-tainting artifacts, but "drifted off to sleep" finale lacks the textural specificity demanded at elite levels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Exile/sanctions premise feels template-driven; removing "terra-cotta arbor" or "silver bell" wouldn't break logic. Emotional truth is earnest but lacks fresh inflection—transformation test fails as plot works identically with generic "community leader" in any crisis.</comment>
