<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "strength in vulnerability" without embodied contradiction; motivation is stated not dramatized. No micro-choices under pressure—janitor's sweeping remains unchanged despite philosophical pondering. Diagnostic label-speak triggers anti-pattern penalty (-0.5) during peak reflection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: no spatial anchors beyond "tracking station" by 120 words, harming clarity. Accumulative lens applies but closure lacks legible cost—departure at dawn feels like soft reset, not Earned Stasis. Cost proof test fails; no on-page consequence for the janitor's "vulnerability" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details ("soft-bristled broom," "velvet expanse") create sensory immersion but serve as backdrop, not pressure. Tracking station fails micro-setting test—no tool/environment constrains choices. Lantern glass is ornamental; its "prominence" shift carries no tactical consequence despite reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No dramatized stake escalation. "Finding strength in vulnerability" remains abstract motivation without concrete test—janitor faces zero opposition or trade-offs. Pressure never coheres; sweeping continues uninterrupted. Band guardrail violated: no visible price charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty (-0.7) for final paragraph's explicit moralizing: "testament to the power of stillness and vulnerability." Lantern symbolism (beacon in darkness) is convenient, not earned through action. Theme resolves into simplistic binary without complexity or counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uniform "janitor felt..." cadence creates syntactic monotony; no perceptual signature beyond generic awe ("twinkled like diamonds"). Voice modulates poorly—reflection intensity matches calm sweeping, not peak pressure. Fails 9+ test: no rhythmic control under pressure (none exists).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Template cadence: 7 consecutive "As..." openings in paragraphs 3-5 trigger -0.6 penalty. Paraphrase loops ("flourishing stillness" x4) and therapy-speak ("strength in vulnerability") cluster in reflection beats, dulling closure. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense of connection") exceed peak-beat tolerance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor trope untransformed; spiritually curious archetype matches writing-template safety middle. No fresh inflection—Zen clichés ("beauty in stillness") lack specific lived detail. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: emotional truth sacrificed for generic profundity.</comment>
