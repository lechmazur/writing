<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans toward abstraction ("felt the weight of her own insignificance") rather than embodied contradiction; renewal occurs via sensory overload without concrete struggle against her flaws, missing the 9+ requirement for contradictory impulses acting in scene during pivotal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens—the final image of stars refracted through opera glasses reweights rebellion's meaning with conceptual cost of insignificance—but the felt price of her insignificance confrontation lacks visceral specificity in the closure beat itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry anchors mood, but neither the spaceport nor stone circle actively constrains choices; the opera glasses (micro-setting) charge the final image yet fail to shape mid-scene tactics, narrowly missing Q3's 9+ gate requiring environment/tool to constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation succeeds as the hum's intensification deepens her resolve, but the dominant stake's cost remains abstract (emotional insignificance) without tangible trade-off; the final reweighted vision charges the image yet lacks a visible price altering future tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sensory particulars—no moralizing—but "thunderous serenity" risks thematic patness; the final refracted-star image offers resonant non-literal answer to reigniting purpose, though the stone circle's legend slightly over-signals the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with astronomical metaphors ("margin of daylight"), but phrases like "thrummed through every cell" verge on biological vagueness; consistent POV with strong perceptual signature, though "thunderous serenity" borders on conceptual abstraction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor abstraction ("weight of insignificance") and near-synonym churn ("reignited the spark"/"rekindled the fire") in mid-beats; final image avoids overwriting, but "twinkled in anticipation" edges toward sentimentality, narrowly avoiding Q7's 9+ requirement for zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebel burnout via sensory ritual (stone hum) avoids trope clichés; vintage opera glasses transform "stargazer" from stock into idiosyncratic vessel, though the stone circle legend slightly echoes common mystical tropes without full transformation.</comment>
