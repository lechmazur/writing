<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but "Accidentally prophetic" trait remains label-only without embodied conflict. No visible cost in final choice beyond vague "weight of responsibility."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dawn arrival) lacks legible cost; "weight of responsibility" is stated not dramatized. Orientation succeeds early but escalation fails—no meaningful tightening of options or knowledge shift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse and glass lantern create vivid atmosphere, but neither constrains choices or charges closure. "Emerald" detail remains decorative; micro-setting (lantern wick) lacks causal pressure despite two appearances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>No escalation occurs—the ritual proceeds unimpeded. Stakes ("shaping the day") stay abstract with no concrete test or trade-off. Single "tightening" (dawn's arrival) is passive, not driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of tradition vs. digital age emerges through newspaper contrast, but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to enduring power"), triggering Q5 penalty. Closure lacks non-literal answer to central question; resolution feels asserted not earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("beam slicing through darkness," "shadowed elation") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "Accidentally prophetic" phrasing, but voice modulates effectively with ritual intensity under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery but scaffolded telling ("she believed," "she knew") dulls immediacy in key beats. Template cadence in ritual descriptions ("With each precise adjustment... she felt...") triggers minor loop penalty, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythology with physics ("total internal reflection"), but "storm herald" trope lacks transformation. Emotional specificity in "shadowed elation" elevates, yet premise remains too close to archetypal ritual narratives without sufficient risk.</comment>
