<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; Lyra executes flawlessly without internal struggle or micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pendant spell works instantly). No visible flaws complicate her choices, violating single-POV baseline for authentic crisis response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity caps score: Hybrid elements (Accumulative/Textural buildup with causal hints) aren't clarified by midpoint. Cost is legible ("giant stirred... tremor beneath her feet") but lens instability prevents higher band despite solid Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid canal/tower descriptions lack functional constraint; rooftop setting remains postcard backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures choices. Strong sensory specificity but fails 9+ gate—environment doesn't alter tactics or charge final image beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via giant's nap timeframe, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Lyra's plan succeeds without trade-offs or narrowing options. Cost ("mortal comprehension" limits) feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned through her actions during the pressure sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through canal rhythms and pendant symbolism, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("whispers of the past") reweights "echoes" with conceptual cost, but "essence of eternity" phrasing edges toward abstraction, limiting transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("serpentine waterway," "water's gentle song") modulates with time dilation. Minor register drift in "insatiable drive" disrupts Lyra's voice during peak pressure, preventing 8.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Template cadence in final third ("As she worked... With each moment... As she opened") dulls immediacy. Filter-verb stack ("Lyra felt... She smiled...") in closure beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty, disallowing 9+ globally per text-artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh urban-myth synthesis undermined by derivative "giant beneath city" trope; transformation test fails (swap "giant" for "dragon" and plot remains identical). Specific illustrator details avoid genericity but don't offset premise safety.</comment>
