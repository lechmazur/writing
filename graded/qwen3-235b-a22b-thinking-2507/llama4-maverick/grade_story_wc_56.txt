<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "false narratives" epiphany reads as diagnostic label-speak without embodied struggle. Motivation ("architecture of lies") remains abstractly stated rather than tested through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks visible cost; "serene upheaval" feels unearned. Orientation failure: canal setting remains vague past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details but setting functions as static backdrop; canal never constrains choices or alters tactics. Micro-setting (sundial) fails to charge final image despite physical presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("hindsight clarity") remain abstractly declared with zero dramatized test. Zero escalation under Accumulative lens—pressure never tightens options or knowledge, violating Band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty triggered: final paragraph moralizes ("some truths only revealed in stillness") replacing scene pressure. Theme stated repeatedly through label-speak ("architecture of lies") without emergent resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice lacks perceptual signature; "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear" recur generically. Under search pressure, prose stays uniformly lyrical without compression or stress-appropriate diction shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt...") and template cadence ("As she gazed... As the stars...") in final third dull closure image. Filter-verb stacks in climax beat disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "mythical object granting self-knowledge" trope executed generically. Zero fresh inflection; canal/sundial details feel like placeholder symbolism without specific lived detail.</comment>
