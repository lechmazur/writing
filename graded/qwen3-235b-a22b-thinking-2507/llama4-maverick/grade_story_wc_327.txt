<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("quietly articulate eyes," "deep understanding") without embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost in character state despite thematic resonance. No micro-choices under pressure beyond observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: storyteller's voice fading into echoes with diamond's transformation shows conceptual cost. Orientation anchors immediately; accumulative lens (density/pattern shift) holds through closure without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Towers of bone and flawed diamond charge the final image ("symbol of the storyteller's art"), constraining the translation effort. Sensory details (shadows as "kinetic sculpture," whispers vibrating air) are purpose-driven and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving dying language) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—pressure accumulates without narrowing options or trade-offs. Bird patterns shift but don't heighten cost beyond initial premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from texture-to-sound translation, with final image ("new language... evolve and grow") offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but secondary stake (diamond's curse) remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper-veined," "texture of shadows") and rhythmic control shine, though "patterns shifting and evolving" repeats verbatim near closure, slightly dulling pressure in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stunning imagery but paraphrase loop ("patterns shifting and evolving" duplicated in final paragraph) dulls closure beat. Overwritten moments ("symphony of movement that belied chaos") risk muddle yet serve accumulative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric structure and sensory translation; "flawed diamond as catalyst" transforms trope through concrete stakes. Risk-taking heightens coherence but lacks one bold inflection (e.g., deeper tension in language death).</comment>
