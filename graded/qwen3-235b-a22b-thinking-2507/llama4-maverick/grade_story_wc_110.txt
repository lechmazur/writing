<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("thaw mistrust") is clear but lacks embodied struggle; epiphany feels unearned as mistrust "melts away" without concrete cost. Diagnostic label "thaw mistrust with transparency" triggers penalty; no visible sacrifice for honesty despite stated stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure (freedom via lens) lacks felt cost—mistrust dissolves magically without trade-off. Accumulative lens holds but pressure never tightens; "resonant hush" offers no reconfiguration beyond abstract peace. No price paid for honesty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt evokes atmosphere but remains decorative backdrop; wet stone/rain scent never constrains choices. Lens functions as micro-setting yet fails 9+ gate—final image (looking through lens) charges theme but doesn’t alter tactics or reveal new constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honesty vs. mistrust) remains abstract; no on-page test of commitment. Pressure stagnates as registrar passively observes—"mistrust melting" is declared, not earned through choice. Zero escalation beyond internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of "freed by honesty" emerges but resolution is platitudinal ("truth shine through like crystal"). Final image avoids moralizing yet oversimplifies—mistrust vanishes without acknowledging complexity, weakening resonance. No counter-readings or earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV voice is lyrical but overwrought ("resonant hush," "ambiguously clear" repeated 3x). Perceptual signature shows registrar’s bias yet flattens under pressure—no syntactic shift during climax. No dialogue, but interiority avoids therapy-speak despite thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: "ambiguously clear glass" (redundant), "whispers of the city" (cliché), and stacked metaphors ("mistrust melting... replaced by clarity"). Template cadence in 7/10 high-pressure beats ("She..."; "The lens...") dulls immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "truth frees" trope with crystal motifs echoing common literary shorthand. No fresh inflection—regurgitates transparency-as-redemption without interrogating its limits. Risk-taking (lyric mode) fails as vagueness obscures stakes rather than heightening them.</comment>
