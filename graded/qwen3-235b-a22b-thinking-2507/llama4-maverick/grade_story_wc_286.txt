<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "phototropic to kindness" is diagnostic label-speak that undermines embodied emotion. No visible cost in closure beyond abstract realization, weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost: the wasteland's perceived "less desolate" state is subjective, not a felt forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but density fails to reweight stakes with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting charges closure through the lantern glass's "gentle curves" as a beacon of hope, but "old honey and wax" scent remains ornamental without constraining choices earlier in the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens; "fractured timelines" concept never tightens options or alters tactics. Stakes remain abstract ("resistance to change") without concrete on-page test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lantern glass reprise, but "kindness as resistance" is overtly stated in final paragraphs ("infused with kindness"), triggering thematic echo penalty for moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun patterns etched into glass," "thrum like a heartbeat") modulates rhythm under contemplative pressure, though "phototropic" disrupts lexicon plausibility for a potter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflective blocks ("As she pondered..."; "As chimney smoke...") dulls momentum, but lyrical cadence ("fluid, like unfolding lotus") avoids fatal loops in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Transforms "fractured timelines" trope through tactile pottery lens, but "beekeeping oasis" specificity lacks emotional transformation; risks middle-ground hedging on change/resistance duality.</comment>
