<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to "seed innovation within constraints" is clear but remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. "Groundedly imaginative" functions as label-only trait without visible tradeoffs. Final poised stance lacks earned cost or meaningful change, failing the closure causality test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>No causal tightening or textural escalation occurs—the cartographer merely prepares to write. Closure as "Charged Poise" lacks legible cost; the pen's hover feels static, not reconfigured. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Situational) undermines pressure coherence by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Frozen lake and obsidian spire create vivid atmosphere but function as postcard backdrop. Micro-setting (quill nib) is handled twice yet never constrains choices or charges the final image. Sensory details remain decorative rather than altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("seed innovation within constraints") is declared but never concretely tested; the spire's constraint doesn't narrow options. Zero escalation—no tightening choice or deepening knowledge shift. Stakes stay abstract, with no visible price paid to reweight the final poised moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of constrained innovation emerges through imagery but collapses into final thematic echo: "vision waited to be set free." No resonant non-literal answer—closure restates the premise without reweighting cost. Earned ambiguity is absent; moral calculus remains untested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with distinctive "groundedly imaginative" phrasing, but fails under pressure: high-stakes writing beat lacks syntactic compression or stress-driven diction shifts. Perceptual signature is selective yet static, never modulating with rising tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Duplicate phrasing ("pen hovered, poised") creates paraphrase loop; "groundedly imaginative" label repeats without embodiment. Overwritten peaks ("kaleidoscope of possibility") dilute momentum in high-pressure beats. Minor artifacts avoid closure damage but cap density below 7.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" offers fresh framing but executes safely through abstract contemplation. No bold risk-taking—spire/frozen lake tropes lack transformative specificity. Emotional truth is sacrificed for poetic vagueness, failing the transformation test for true originality.</comment>
