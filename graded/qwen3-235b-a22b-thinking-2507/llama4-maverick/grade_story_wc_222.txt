<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Label-heavy interiority ("chivalrous nature demanded," "sacredly playful") lacks embodied contradiction; motivation clear but no meaningful internal conflict tested under pressure during the chess swap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: sky fixes magically with zero consequence for Moonwhisper; "Earned Stasis" claim fails as no path is foreclosed—mission succeeds effortlessly despite declared dangers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ice spire setting vivid but ornamental; "treacherous ice tunnels" never pressure choices. Pocket sundial’s reprise charges the final image but doesn’t constrain any action earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</question><grade>Stakes remain abstract ("fabric of reality unraveling") with no concrete on-page test; pressure never escalates beyond initial "fraught with danger" claim as the swap occurs smoothly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme ("apprentice of wonder") stated but not earned through struggle; final paragraph’s moralizing ("world would soon feel the touch") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undermining resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV consistent with lyrical texture, but "as they..." repetition dulls rhythm; stress compression undercuts tension ("cautious abandon" never tested against actual peril).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("gazing out," "ventured deeper") and template cadence ("With a deep breath...") sap momentum; final-third purple prose ("crystals seemed to sing") dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Chivalrous thief trope given poetic treatment but lacks fresh inflection; "celestial chess" concept derivative without meaningful transformation of the mechanic.</comment>
