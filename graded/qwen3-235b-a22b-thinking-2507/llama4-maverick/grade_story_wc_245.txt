<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority abstract; "labyrinth of sorrow" tells rather than shows embodied conflict. No contradictory impulses during pivotal stillpoint choice despite emotional stakes, undermining earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (trepidation amid understanding), but "heart swelled" lacks concrete embodiment. Lens (Accumulative) holds, yet cost proof fails—no specific image makes price undeniable at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains choice via sound-based navigation; platinum ring and tattoos charge final image. Sensory specificity (shifting tattoos, scent absorption) elevates beyond decoration to drive the mapmaker's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory accumulation (musical notes intensifying), narrowing options via the forest's demands. Cost is felt but not concrete—"trepidation" lacks physical manifestation despite the mapmaker's embodied perception system.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotional navigation emerges through "quiet blaze" imagery and tattoo shifts, avoiding moralizing. Final stillpoint revelation reweights "sorrow" as harmonious understanding, but near-miss with thematic echo in "mysteries of the heart" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via skin-based language absorption and ultrasonic attunement. Tension modulates rhythm ("musical notes grew louder... heart beat in time"), though late constellations reference slightly disrupts spatial focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As they walked... As constellations shifted... As they continued") triggers -0.6 loop penalty. "Trepidation and wonder" uses therapy-speak label where embodied contradiction was needed, dulling climax impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and emotional healing via skin-language absorption. "Platinum compass ring" transforms trope through sensory constraints, but "stillpoint" concept leans on familiar spiritual quest frameworks without radical reinvention.</comment>
