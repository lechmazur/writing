<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("preserve wonder") is stated but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict or embodied contradiction shown despite "migrating identities" concept. Flaw: serene passivity contradicts promised tension of "fluctuating with moon phases."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost of "after tomorrow disappears," but orientation fails: unclear who/where at 120 words despite poetic vagueness. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet no pressure buildup precedes the crystallized ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (saltwater scent, wicker texture) anchor atmosphere, but setting remains decorative backdrop; tidal atrium never constrains choices or charges closure. Micro-setting potential (bamboo creel) squandered as static symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No escalation or pressure: dominant stake ("preserve wonder") faces zero opposition, no tightening of options. "After tomorrow disappears" timeframe stated but never tightens tactics; conceptual cost lacks felt urgency on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Migrating identities" theme resonates through moon-phase motif, but moralizing line ("motivation became clear: to preserve wonder") triggers Q5 penalty. Final image reweights premise yet avoids earned complexity through serene abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct rhythmic control ("deliberate slowness... deliberate dance") sustains Accumulative lens; no head-hopping. But "titan-gear" jargon disrupts lexicon consistency, and thematic echo ("migrating identities") mars final paragraph's resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong textural density with minimal loops, yet "soothing melody" cliché and "flowed like the tides" weaken specificity. Final third's "symbol of simple beauty" is tell-not-show, disqualifying 9+ despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "titan-gear" and tidal rhythms avoids tropes, but emotional specificity lacks: librarian's "serenity" never conflicts with promised moon-phase volatility. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens coherence yet avoids tangible stakes.</comment>
