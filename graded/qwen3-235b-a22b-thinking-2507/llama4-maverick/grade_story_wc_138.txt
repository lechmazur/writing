<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("what happens after goodbye?") is clear but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "mixture of wonder and trepidation" uses diagnostic label-speak during climax, triggering anti-pattern penalty. No visible struggle or micro-choices under pressure—transformation feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise with "I am what remains after goodbye") reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—solar storm pressure doesn’t narrow options. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for weak causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite offers vivid atmosphere but functions as white room; no constraint on choices (e.g., magnetic fields could occur anywhere). Final color-fade charges closure yet lacks prior tactical integration, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding "after goodbye") is signaled early and deepens through storm intensity, but agency is passive—Kael’s actions ("weave magnetic fields") feel inevitable rather than earned choices. Cost is conceptual but lacks visceral felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates closure: "discovered that even in goodbye, there was a new beginning" states the moral outright, violating Q5’s anti-pattern rule. Final paragraph moralizing (-0.7 penalty) replaces earned resonance with pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice has strong textural specificity ("prismatic escondite," "dimensionally aware"), but perceptual signature lacks character bias—Kael’s observations ("colors danced") remain tourist-catalog generic under pressure, missing 9+ rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Kael [verb], and [conjunction] Kael [verb]") and filter-verb stacks ("allowed the immortal to perceive") dull immediacy in climax. Final-third artifacts (-0.5 penalty) obscure closure’s conceptual cost with redundant description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"After goodbye" framing offers fresh angle on farewell-as-transformation, but execution relies on genre tropes ("spatial mutiny," immortal boredom) without specific lived detail. Emotional truth lacks risk-taking, settling into safety middle.</comment>
