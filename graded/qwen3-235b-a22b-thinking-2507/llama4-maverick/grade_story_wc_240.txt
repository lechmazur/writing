<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("quiet wildfire," "physics of letting go") rather than embodied contradiction; no visible cost for her epiphany despite Q1’s requirement for "felt cost scaled to this length." Micro-choices lack pressure—e.g., the laser button is handled passively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "quiet wildfire burning brighter" is vague metaphor, failing Q2’s "cost proof test." Orientation is strong (anchored by para 1), but Accumulative lens suffers from undramatized stakes—no constraint shapes tactics, and the laser button’s "significance" remains untested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but inert; mushrooms supply no pressure (she navigates "with ease"), and the laser button fails micro-setting integration. Violates Q3’s 9+ gate: no environment/tool constrains choice or charges closure—the farm’s bioluminescence is decorative, not functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("revolutionize interaction") remains abstract with no on-page test; "familiar strangers" never manifest as pressure. Escalation lacks protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—no deepening reweights stakes with cost. Band guardrail fails: no "visible price that charges the final image."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("world... complex, interconnected web") triggers Q5’s -0.7 penalty for explicit moralizing. Theme emerges from abstraction, not particulars; the laser button’s "pulsing significance" feels symbolically convenient rather than earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose has lyrical texture but head-voice dominates with philosophical abstractions ("understand the physics of letting go"), violating stress degradation principles. Under dawn’s "quiet intensity," language grows more abstract rather than sensory—e.g., "weaving into the fabric of the farm" lacks character-particular perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks cluster in climax: "began to observe," "began to move," "felt a sense of stillness." Template cadence in final paragraph ("As... Lena felt... Lena knew...") dulls closure; Q7’s -0.5 applies for artifacts in final third, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: "familiar strangers" and bioluminescent farm feel like aesthetic collage, not transformed through character-specific stakes. No fresh inflection—e.g., the laser button’s role is generic, failing Q8’s "transformation test" for emotional specificity.</comment>
