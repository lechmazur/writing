<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "whimsically attentive" remains label-only without tradeoffs. Emotional progression is tidy (solitude to fulfillment) with therapy-speak like "cautious exuberance" undermining embodiment. Micro-choices absent under pressure despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("cycles of compassion"), but cost proof fails—no exact image concretizes loss beyond abstract "fulfillment." Causal lens holds cleanly through locket discovery to project initiation, though escalation lacks narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sea/library atmosphere vividly anchors mood, but setting never constrains choices—it's postcard backdrop. Recurring sea motif charges final image ("looked out to the sea") yet lacks causal pressure on tactics. Micro-setting (locket) misses 9+ gate by not altering final decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring silent contributors) signaled early but never viscerally tested; escalation feels frictionless. Lena's agency drives tightening ("proposed organizing events"), yet cost remains conceptual rather than tangible—no earned tradeoffs like sacrificed time or resources narrow her options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket/project particulars, but Sophia's explicit "cycles of compassion" line triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Final image ("friendship would flourish") offers resonant non-literal answer yet lacks meaningful ambiguity—no counter-readings challenge the idealized resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV control strong with Lena's sensory selectivity (book textures, sea whispers), but "whimsically attentive" is diagnostic label without perceptual signature. Dialogue lacks subtext—"I think that might be mine" states intent plainly—and voice convergence flattens distinction between Lena/Sophia during emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("gentle breeze carried whispers... mingling with musty scent") and therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance") cause -0.3 momentum drag. Propulsion strong in discovery beat, yet filter verbs ("Lena's eyes... scanned") dull immediacy where concrete action would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar premise (chance meeting → friendship) lacks fresh synthesis; cargo broker detail remains ornamental rather than transforming stakes. Emotional specificity in library serendipity shows ingenuity, but derivative "silent contributors" trope avoids bold risk—no moral ambiguity or genuine struggle complicates the uplift mission.</comment>
