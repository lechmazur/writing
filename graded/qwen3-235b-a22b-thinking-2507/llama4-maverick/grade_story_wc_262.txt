<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; motivation ("inexplicable pull") lacks concrete roots. Final realization about love's endurance feels unearned as no prior struggle or cost is embodied. "Unused love" phrasing risks diagnostic label-speak without specific sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation fails: no temporal anchor by 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—"weight lifting" is abstract with no on-page proof of change. Two distinct non-closure issues (orientation + cost ambiguity) trigger -1.5 cap, preventing higher score despite Accumulative lens holding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("scent of old celluloid") but projection booth never constrains choices. Film strip as micro-setting fails—it’s handled passively with no tactical impact. Final image of "film strip remaining" doesn’t reconfigure meaning despite lyrical description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No discernible stakes: "find where love is stored" lacks urgency or consequence. Zero escalation under Accumulative lens—density never intensifies meaningfully. "Hush before thunder" foreshadows nothing tangible; no visible price paid for the vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: final paragraph states thesis outright ("testament to power of love"). "Unused love" concept is told, not earned through struggle. Pseudo-profundity ("even in forgetting, some things remain forever") triggers -0.7 penalty for moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV leakage: narrator asserts "letters were a manifestation of unused love"—knowledge the gazer couldn’t have. Perceptual signature is generic ("poignant expressions") not character-particular. Consistent lyrical tone but lacks distinct rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops: "room faded... transported" adjacent sentences. Filter-verb stack in climax ("felt atmosphere thickening... felt music awakening... felt weight lifting") triggers -0.5 penalty. Final paragraph synonym churn ("secrets uncovered/yielded/unlocking") dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "crystal gazer + haunted theater" tropes lack fresh inflection. Swap "film strip" for "diary" and story functions identically. Safety-middle hedging avoids bold choices about love's actual cost; emotional truth feels generic.</comment>
