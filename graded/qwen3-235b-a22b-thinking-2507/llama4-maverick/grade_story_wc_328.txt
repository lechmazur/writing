<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("gravitationally playful nature," "bitterness into cosmic joke") without concrete embodiment; motivation lacks contradictory impulses—only told, never tested through micro-choices under pressure like handling the arrowhead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation fails by 120 words (unclear where "underground garden" is globally); closure as Charged Poise lacks legible cost—final "frostbitten hope" feels unearned without visible tradeoffs, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for density-driven reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("damp earth," "moss-covered stone") anchor atmosphere early, but the herbalist’s garden never constrains choices or charges the final image—it’s decorative setting, not micro-setting that alters tactics per Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("restore balance to the world") remain abstract and untested; pressure doesn’t tighten under Accumulative lens—static confessions deepen nothing, and no on-page cost (e.g., Lena’s exhaustion or sacrificed tools) narrows options or alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme ("harmony untamed") is redundantly stated, not earned through concrete struggle; final "cosmic joke" moralizing replaces resonant imagery, triggering Thematic Echo penalty for explicit thesis in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV voice has lyrical texture but collapses under pressure—repetitive "frostbitten hope" refrains and "gravitationally playful" jargon violate Lena’s plausible lexicon, creating register drift into abstract academic diction during high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting sinks closure: "frostbitten hope" repeats 3x in final 70 words with synonym churn ("glimmer of light," "sense of determination"), forming a paraphrase loop that dulls the Charged Poise image per Q7 loop penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Cryptid researcher" is generic trope window-dressing; "harmony untamed" concept lacks transformation—it’s a stock mystical phrase applied generically, failing Derivative Premise Guardrail by mirroring clichéd "untamed force" tropes without specific lived detail.</comment>
