<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on generic phrases ("weight settling heavy") without contradictory impulses; motivation shifts abruptly from reluctance to determination via unearned nut connection. No visible cost to endurance beyond abstract frost threat, undermining Earned Stasis credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with glowing labyrinth guiding travelers, but cost remains conceptual (untested frost deadline). Blueprint discovery lacks causal motivation—triggered by nut without prior setup—compromising lens coherence. Orientation clear but midpoint lens ambiguity weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (dust, golden glow) anchor setting early, but environment fails to constrain choices; frost threat and labyrinth stones remain decorative. Micro-setting nut reappears in final image but never pressures tactics, missing 9+ gate requirement for functional constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding travelers) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—frost deadline introduced late without prior establishment. Mechanical birds create tension but resolve without cost, violating "coincidence may complicate not resolve" rule. Stakes remain abstract despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope through restoration emerges organically, but final moralizing ("beacon of hope") over-explains closure. Avoids thematic echo penalty yet lacks non-literal answer; "graceless beauty" motif stated but not reweighted through action. Resonance diluted by explicit resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with rhythmic control ("golden glow," "ethereal light"), but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read generic. "Offhandedly exact" trait remains label-only without influencing diction. No head-hopping, yet stress compression feels underdeveloped in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean prose with strong verbs ("trudged," "swooped"), but filter verbs ("she felt") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold in opening ("weight settling heavy" cliché), yet no figurative muddle. Final image’s "delicate veil of ice" achieves high textural specificity without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cursed orchard + mechanical birds offers fresh synthesis, but execution leans on familiar tropes (magical blueprint, sudden determination). Specific frost patterns and blueprint creases add verisimilitude, yet "reluctant caretaker" archetype lacks transformative detail. Avoids derivative premise guardrail but risks middle-ground hedging.</comment>
