<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in numbness vs artistic drive is concrete, but "lance the boil" slips into clinical label-speak (-0.4), undermining embodied emotion at pivotal self-confrontation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the ribbon-tucked departure crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible cost ("thaw a part of the detective's heart"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded quarry constrains perception (face-blind artist's texture focus) and supplies the ribbon, charging the final image—but lacks active tactical pressure during key choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (emotional numbness vs empathy) tightens via ribbon-triggered epiphany; artist's brushstrokes and detective's realization show agency-driven escalation with unmistakable cost in "thawed heart."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through portrait process and mask fragment without moralizing; final image reweights "cold cases" into human connection, avoiding thematic echo while resonating beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (texture/light focus) and rhythmic control shine, but "lance the boil" momentarily breaks artist's lexicon, causing minor register drift in peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but clinical metaphor "lance the boil" violates POV lexicon in high-pressure moment (-0.3), preventing 9+ despite otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artistry and cold cases transforms tropes; quarry setting and empathy angle feel specific and inevitable, though risk-taking stops short of structural boldness for 9+.</comment>
