<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (professional duty vs personal grief), but "lying to herself" realization lacks embodied cost and risks therapy-speak; no micro-choices under pressure beyond observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing (files archived not deleted), but cost remains abstract ("no longer pain") without visible on-page manifestation; Accumulative lens holds though pattern escalation feels passive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Server room setting creates strong atmosphere ("labyrinth of servers"), but micro-setting objects like the patch don't constrain choices; recurring numbers lack physical interaction to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens through pattern recognition, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—numbers appear magically without Lena's active attempts that fail; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of digital memory vs human loss emerges organically through archive metaphor, but final "reminder of what could be found" borders on thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet lacks concrete emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brightly attentive eyes scanned metadata") with rhythmic control under pressure; consistent tech-lexicon avoids corporate jargon despite single POV limiting dialogue opportunities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("haunting sense of absence"/"sensed absence") and template cadence ("As she...") in mid-beats; strong specificity ("4-1-5-9") but final image lacks textural charge to elevate closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology and cosmic mystery via "Echo-1" patch; transforms missing persons trope through archival lens, though corporate conspiracy elements feel underdeveloped in this scope.</comment>
