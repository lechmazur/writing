<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("claustrophobic spelunker," "unique ability to track invisible things") without embodied contradiction; motivation to "stand by the unremembered" feels told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with physical cost ("gasping with sudden change in pressure"), but the gold fleck illuminant's role is underdeveloped, weakening causal escalation at the chamber sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Undersea setting vividly rendered but functions as backdrop; the "crashing hush" motif charges the final image yet fails to constrain choices earlier (e.g., claustrophobia isn't tested during phase transition).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tidal window creates coherent pressure, but the escape resolution lacks struggle—Lyra steps into the torrent and succeeds without meaningful adaptation to the cables' physical cost beyond sensory description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring the unremembered remains abstract; final image ("secrets waiting to be unlocked") edges toward thematic echo without earning resonance through concrete sacrifice or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV consistent but filter verbs ("Lyra's eyes scanned," "she became aware") dilute immediacy; stress moments lack syntactic degradation (e.g., uniform lyrical prose during tidal rush).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor redundancies ("navigated... with ease," "made her way deeper") and scaffolded telling ("her mind racing with implications") sap momentum; no fatal loops but density suffers in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Phase-transition cables offer fresh tech twist, yet claustrophobic spelunker trope feels underexploited; emotional specificity lacks when Lyra's return lacks tangible cost beyond physical strain.</comment>
