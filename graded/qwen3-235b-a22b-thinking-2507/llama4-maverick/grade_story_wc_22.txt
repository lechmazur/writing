<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zero contradictory impulses; motivation remains abstract "vision" without embodied struggle. "Spiritual connection" replaces concrete micro-choices under pressure, especially during fertilization—a pivotal moment lacking physical or emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Closure fails Charged Poise test: no visible cost for "garden reborn" payoff. "Mission accomplished" negates Earned Stasis potential; reef's death faces no resistance, making rebirth feel unearned. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) undermines cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry (blooming flowers, bird calls) anchors setting early, but jetty/reef remain postcard backdrops. Environment never constrains choices—horses graze freely, seed pods deploy without struggle, missing 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("let garden reclaim battlefield") lacks escalation: reef's death is passive backdrop, not active pressure. Fertilization occurs effortlessly with zero resistance, violating Band Guardrails for 8.0+—no narrowing of options or trade-offs during the sole "tightening" beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges through seed pods and "submerged concord," but final moralizing ("land would flourish") triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Garden rebirth resolves conflict symmetrically without lingering ambiguity, reducing complexity to simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV consistency anchors coachman's perception, yet "submerged concord" intrudes as abstract concept rather than character-particular thought. Over-reliance on passive constructions ("was known to speak," "began to fertilize") dulls immediacy during action beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Template cadence plagues pivotal moments: "With... With... As he worked..." loops in para 8-9. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to absorb," "felt the harmony") obscure embodied action during fertilization—a high-pressure beat requiring visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coachman’s linguistic skill offers fresh inflection, but "dying reef to garden" premise relies on overused ecological redemption tropes. Lacks transformation through specific lived detail—could transplant to any landscape with minor edits, failing Proximity Check.</comment>
