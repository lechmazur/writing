<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("eroded ambitions," "fierce determination") with diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; embodied emotion lacks contradictory impulses despite strong regret-as-mist imagery. Final renunciation feels earned but cost remains conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (shutter click crystallizing irretrievable past), but cost proof is thin—no concrete loss beyond thematic "regret." Orientation is clear, Accumulative lens holds, yet pressure lacks tangible narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon functions as micro-setting charging the final image, but fails the 9+ gate: environment doesn’t constrain choices (e.g., how water’s physics affects scavenging). Disposable camera wheel is vivid but not tactically integrated beyond symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with past) tightens through fragment accumulation, yet cost remains abstract—no visible price paid (e.g., physical toll, discarded fragment). Agency is passive collection, not active choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via lagoon’s "fractured stillness" mirroring memory, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though "negotiating with ghost" edges toward thematic echo in mid-story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("regret hung... palpable mist") and rhythmic control, but slips into abstract diagnosis ("resolute scavenger," "chronologically confused") that clashes with scavenger’s exhaustion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with minimal scaffold, but "fractured stillness" repeats without deepening, and elevated diction ("resolute," "eroded ambitions") creates register drift in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinetic lagoon physics with memory fragmentation transforms scavenger trope; emotional specificity avoids cliché. Carousel metaphor feels familiar, slightly diluting risk distinction.</comment>
