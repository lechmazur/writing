<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") lacks embodied friction; gardening mistake told not shown, weakening motivation. Final acceptance of weeds as "necessary step" earns change but lacks visceral cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "weeds... seemed like a necessary step" crystallizes stance with emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds via sensory thickening, but "contingent relationships" method feels tacked on without causal payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly actively pressures choices (responds to pen manipulation); the pen as micro-setting constrains action and charges final image. Sensory details ("air seemed to thicken") mirror internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (editing history) remains abstract until final ink-flow moment; gardening mistake lacks concrete on-page test. Escalation via sensory density works, but cost feels retrospective rather than dramatized in the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pen restoration mirroring self-acceptance; "weeds as necessary step" reweights failure without moralizing. Final image ("guardian of this threshold") offers resonant non-literal answer to narrative power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cosmos's whispers," "fragile as spider's web") sustains Accumulative lens. Minor register drift ("contingent relationships") clashes with voice, but compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "ink flowed onto a blank page" shows rather than tells. Slight overwriting in "testament to the anomaly's unique properties" but no muddle in peak beats. Final line avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial mechanics and history-editing through gravitational anomaly setting. "Weeds as necessary step" transforms gardening trope with earned emotional specificity, avoiding derivative "magic pen" clichés.</comment>
