<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is thematic echo without embodied struggle. Final choice feels unearned as parties shift abruptly with no micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (drawer pull in pocket) lacks visible cost; "mist closed in" is atmospheric but fails cost proof test. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Causal) weakens escalation despite parapet anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Parapet/mist creates vivid atmosphere but micro-setting (drawer pull) doesn't constrain choices. "Furrowed hush" tone is evocative yet static, missing sensory evolution during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prisoner exchange) remains abstract; "recycle mistakes" motivation never faces concrete test. Moon-phase method announced but never shown affecting tactics, leaving escalation underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recycle mistakes into wisdom" is overt thematic statement in final paragraph. Closure offers no resonant answer—just assertion—violating organic emergence requirement with prompt-like moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "weathered stones/wind-scoured crenellations" but "furrowed hush" is jarring register drift. Voice modulates well until climax where interiority flattens into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in opening ("stood... gazed... rested") and synonym churn ("uncommonly thoughtful"/"calm determination"). "Mist swirling like a living entity" is stock metaphor dulling immediacy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Neutral territory premise transformed by moon-phase method, but "recycle mistakes" trope remains generic. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) lacks payoff as closure fails to charge final image with specificity.</comment>
