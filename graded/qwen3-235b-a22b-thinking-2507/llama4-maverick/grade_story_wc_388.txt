<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent skeptic motivation but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "excavate truth from comfortable lies" reads as prompt-derived label-speak without micro-choice friction. Final stance crystallization lacks visible cost beyond vague awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) valid under Causal lens but cost proof fails—no legible price paid for discovery beyond conceptual "complexity." Dust storms heighten atmosphere but never constrain tactics or narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid radioactive orchard imagery but setting remains ornamental; trees "looming" and dust storms never pressure choices (navigated "with ease"). Recurring diamond charges final image but micro-setting fails to constrain prior actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-seeking) signaled early but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—environmental pressure never forces trade-offs. "Being watched" tension dissipates without consequence; conceptual cost at climax feels unearned by on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (shredded letters as truth fragments) but final "truth more complex" insight leans abstract. Avoids moralizing yet lacks concrete emotional aftereffect; "poised on threshold" resonates without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes scanning," noticing paper trail) with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; lexicon stays within Aria’s plausible voice though "excavate truth" momentarily drifts toward prompt language.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("Aria's... Aria's... Aria felt") and repetitive openings weaken propulsion. Clean grammar but "mind racing with possibilities" is stock phrasing; final line achieves textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tropes (wasteland, cursed artifact) feel derivative despite "stillpoint" novelty. Emotional specificity avoids templates but transformation test fails—plot works unchanged with generic investigator/diamond. No bold risk-taking beyond competent execution.</comment>
