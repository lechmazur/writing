<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in scene; motivation clear but interiority leans abstract ("half truths she was about to sell") without embodied struggle during crafting. Flaw: no visible cost to subsuming emotions beyond stated detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: grotto holding memory of crafted emotions implies emotional labor's residue. Lens ambiguity early (Causal vs Accumulative) weakens escalation until midpoint crystallizes textural drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Amber grotto creates vivid atmosphere but fails 9+ gate—no constraint on choices (e.g., stones don't affect crafting). Micro-setting potential (petal) unused; scent sensing described but not leveraged for pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nuanced emotion replication) tightens via sensory deepening, but lacks visible trade-off; cost is felt (emotional labor residue) not demonstrated. Agency passive: dealer observes rather than tests limits under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "half truths" and petal symbolism; final image (grotto holding memory) reweights artificiality as meaningful without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but resolution leans slightly neat for complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent-focused, tactile diction) sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in crafting sequence ("weave emotions together") avoids lyric drift. Zero head-hopping; voice modulation impeccable during dusk transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("luminescent stones dimming... flickered back to life") dulls closure beat. Otherwise high density: "static electricity dance of molecules" compresses science/feeling. Final line slightly overwritten but no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion labor + perfumery avoids trope; specificity (static electricity sensing) elevates premise. Risk-taking (textural drive) heightens stakes but core premise remains recognizable—lacks transformative moral calculus for 9+.</comment>
