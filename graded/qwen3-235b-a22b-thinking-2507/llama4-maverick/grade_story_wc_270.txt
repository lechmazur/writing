<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks teeth; "implanted destiny" is stated but not tested through conflicting choices (e.g., no hesitation decoding kite despite plant agitation). Diagnostic label-speak ("implanted destiny") in climax violates peak-beat authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: embryo retrieval brings "warmth" not sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but pressure never escalates meaningfully—plants' agitation doesn’t hinder action. No price paid for decoding or unsealing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity (sulfur scent, fluttering kite tail) grounds setting, but volcanic springs fail to constrain choices—they’re atmospheric backdrop, not active pressure. Micro-setting (kite) charges closure but environment itself doesn’t shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("evolve tradition") remain abstract; no tangible cost for decoding/unsealing (e.g., injury, lost time). Escalation falters—plant agitation rises but resolves without altering Akira’s actions. Dominant stake lacks visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme ("evolve tradition with intent") emerges through embryo retrieval but resolution feels unearned; "implanted destiny" moralizes without concrete struggle. Final image reweights tradition but avoids meaningful ambiguity—triumph lacks counterbalance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (plant telepathy as "susurrus," "tendrils of consciousness") filters setting through Akira’s lens. Voice modulates effectively under pressure—sentences shorten during decoding. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("whispers... rose to fevered pitch... rose to triumphant chorus") dull immediacy. Overwritten metaphors ("lotus blooming in the sun") slightly muddle climax. Strong verbs and sensory texture mostly propel momentum without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "insurgent grandmother" and telepathic connection avoids archetype; volcanic setting elevates trope. Risk-taking (lyric pacing, non-antagonist conflict) heightens stakes but "implanted destiny" concept leans on familiar evolution narratives without sufficient transformation.</comment>
