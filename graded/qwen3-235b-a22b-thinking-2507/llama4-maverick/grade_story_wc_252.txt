<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (duty vs freedom) but epiphany lacks embodied cost; "heart unlock" is label-only abstraction undermining Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens, but cost ("shedding past burdens") remains abstract without visceral on-page evidence at the swim's climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: tide pressure drives Kael's immersion, lunar light charges the final image with tangible constraint on movement and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (whale song → scrimshaw glow), but escalation relies on coincidence (convenient whale call) rather than Kael's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scrimshaw's reprise as "testament to her journey," but final paragraph moralizing ("world was changing... Kael was changing") triggers Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (indigo eyes holding "thousand unspoken stories") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's lunar light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "heart unlock, its guarded depths revealed" uses therapy-speak labels; scaffold phrasing ("felt an inexplicable pull") dulls immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime myth with identity liberation, but "combative tenderness" remains abstract concept rather than embodied risk-taking in pivotal choices.</comment>
