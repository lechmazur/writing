<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("grips reality loosely") rather than embodied contradiction; euthanasia tourist backstory informs but doesn't actively constrain choices. Diagnostic phrasing like "sound of approaching endings" triggers penalty despite strong sensory details in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("fragile peace... might shatter"), but paraphrase loops ("I felt a sense of windborne solace... I felt my heart respond") and late thematic echo ("reminder to cherish every moment") constitute two distinct non-closure issues requiring -1.5 deduction under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Icy setting creates vivid atmosphere but fails 9+ gate: drift-ice marina doesn't constrain choices or charge final image. Strong sensory specificity in "light danced across the ice" and "wind rustling" compensates, yet environment remains decorative backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("mournful sound... impermanent"), but dominant conflict lacks concrete testing—disaster relief work provides distraction without meaningful trade-offs. Visible cost ("fragile peace") charges final image, yet escalation misses band guardrail requiring price that alters tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</comment><comment>Theme emerges through ice/sound motifs but final paragraph's explicit "reminder to cherish every moment" constitutes thematic echo penalty. "Sound of approaching endings" carries conceptual cost yet over-verbalization undercuts earned resonance; strongest subtext lies in physical details like parasol tip's inert presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ice/wind observations, but drumbeat rhythm emerges from repetitive "I felt a sense of..." constructions (5x in 15 lines). Voice modulates poorly under pressure—emotional progression feels over-calibrated without authentic regression, breaking modesty in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("I felt a sense of...") and template cadence ("As I [verb], I [verb]") trigger -1.2 artifact penalty. Final paragraph's thematic echo dulls closure image; "windborne solace" repetition exemplifies scaffold that obscures emotional progression despite lyrical strengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism premise through specific drift-ice marina setting and sensory focus, but "sound of approaching endings" feels like stock metaphor for mortality. Avoids derivative pitfalls via concrete details yet lacks the non-obvious synthesis required for 8.5+; emotional arc remains conventionally linear.</comment>
