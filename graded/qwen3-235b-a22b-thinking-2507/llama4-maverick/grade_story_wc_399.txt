<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("strangely honest," "turmoil beneath") without embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure beyond passive reception. Diagnostic self-awareness ("acknowledging turmoil") lacks specific physicality during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis (enduring duty amid acknowledged turmoil) with felt cost, but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—the Accumulative/Textural drive isn't solidified until the clearing's deepening, weakening early cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sandalwood, dunes) anchor setting, but environment fails to constrain choices or charge the final image; kinetic parapet and half-mask remain ornamental rather than tactical tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom) lacks escalation; pressure never tightens as prophet's arrival merely triggers static contemplation. Turmoil beneath is named but never tested against the calm, leaving stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom preservation emerges through concrete actions, but final paragraph moralizes directly ("carry the echo... a reminder of peace"), triggering severe penalty for thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripheral awareness," "whisperfield calm") creates texture, but psychic distance never shifts under pressure—lyrical cadence remains static during prophet's speech when compression should heighten tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language overloads high-pressure beats ("words like a gentle breeze carrying essence," "fabric of reality reshaped"), creating mixed vehicles and register drift; template cadence in consecration sequence dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mystic ritual tropes feel derivative despite fresh terms ("line walker," "kinetic parapet"); emotional arc remains generic as specificity fails to transform familiar wisdom-preservation premise.</comment>
