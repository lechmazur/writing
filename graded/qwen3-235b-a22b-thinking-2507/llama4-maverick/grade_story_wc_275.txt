<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; pacifism remains untested despite declared stakes, rendering her renunciation of the sword unearned. No micro-choices under pressure—her "senselessly perceptive" trait is stated but never shapes action. The serene dedication reads as static, not a hard-won stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (she renounces her father's path), but escalation fails: the tower's chaos never pressures her oasis. No meaningful tightening—external stakes remain backdrop, not active threat. Cost ("relic of a bygone era") feels abstract without tangible consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass dome and engraved stone constrain her world and charge the final image ("tranquil blaze"). Micro-setting (airship scrap planter) evolves from wreckage to symbol of resilience. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her calm POV, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace vs. chaos) is signaled but never escalates; the ruined city exerts zero pressure on her sanctuary. No on-page reversal or deepening—her choice lacks cost beyond reflection. "Chaos" remains abstract, never testing her resolve with concrete consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "engraved quiet" reweighted at closure, avoiding moralizing. Final image (sleeping amid roses) offers non-literal answer to finding peace in chaos. But stakes' abstraction weakens thematic charge—resonance feels untethered from lived struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature (sensory calm) and rhythmic control, but uniform lyrical cadence lacks modulation under non-existent pressure. Filter verbs ("her gaze drifted," "she felt") dull immediacy in key beats. No dialogue to test distinctness, but interiority avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Loops mar peak beats: "tranquil blaze" repeats verbatim, and "senselessly perceptive" is reiterated without deepening. Overwritten phrases ("serenely dedicated," "gentle hum of carefully cultivated life") slow momentum. Strong verbs ("unfold," "coaxed") are diluted by redundant modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes pacifism and post-apocalypse through rose farming—a fresh angle—but avoids risk by keeping conflict internal and stakes abstract. Emotional specificity (her connection to the stone) feels authentic, yet the safety middle hedges bold choices; the tower's collapse never tests her sanctuary.</comment>
