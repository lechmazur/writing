<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to "mentor resilience" is clear and embodied through "combative tenderness" during annotation, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—only shows focused determination without competing urges. Walking-backwards habit is mentioned but never constrains action or reveals micro-choices under pressure, reducing interiority depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (reversing exile "first step" with eased tension as cost) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost legibility falters—the "quiet triumph" lacks visceral stakes despite atmospheric pressure. Lens holds cleanly through sensory density escalation, though orientation anchors library/POV early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tea cup functions as micro-setting that charges closure: stray leaves in empty cup crystallize the archivist's labor and the soul's fragile transition. Library atmosphere ("dust motes," "creak of shelves") actively pressures choices by framing the annotation task, avoiding postcard passivity through tactile tool integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) tightens via deepening understanding—annotations grow "fervent" as shadow's "topography of the soul" emerges—but cost remains abstract (eased tension) rather than altering tactics. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens, yet the soul's return feels emotionally distant despite "quiet triumph."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image of "stray tea leaves" reweights exile theme non-literally: fragility of return persists beyond "unlocking secrets," avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (tea geometry, annotations) rather than abstraction, though "resilience" phrasing edges toward tell in motivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature shines in selective details ("twisted creatures" for tea leaves), but "world of sorrow" and "fierce protectiveness" lapse into stock phrasing under pressure. Rhythmic control falters in repetitive "as [subject] [verb]" constructions during escalation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("oily liquid," "dust motes danced") but suffers paraphrase loops: "archivist's eyes" repeated 4x with near-identical emphasis on fixation, dulling immediacy in high-pressure annotation beats. Final image avoids muddle, yet cadence stutters with sequential "as" clauses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes "reversible exile" with tea-leaf geometry into fresh emotional logic—exile as solvable topography rather than metaphor. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes through sensory accretion, though playground swing drifts toward lyrical ornament without causal pressure.</comment>
