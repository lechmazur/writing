<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("to find where broken promises heal") remains abstract label-speak without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; the mailman’s "respectfully rebellious" trait lacks visible tradeoffs during the drone crossing, reducing interiority to thematic summary rather than character-particular struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: the mailman succeeds without tangible consequence despite stated risks ("weight... lifted" implies no forfeiture), violating cost proof test; orientation anchors early but Accumulative lens falters as pressure dissipates rather than deepens toward the handover.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thunderstorm bottle charges the final image ("fury still raging... unleashing a different kind of tempest"), reweighting hope through prior particulars; however, the cobalt arcade remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices, missing micro-setting integration for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("broken promises heal") stay abstract and untested—delivery succeeds without visible price paid, while drone border pressure resolves via convenient diversion rather than protagonist agency; escalation lacks meaningful tightening as the crossing occurs unimpeded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Final paragraph’s explicit moralizing ("a reminder that even in turbulent times...") triggers Thematic Echo penalty; the bottle’s symbolic shift toward hope feels unearned as subtext is drowned by overt statements, undermining organic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV voice maintains consistent lyrical texture ("neon lights danced," "brittle hush"), but abstract phrases like "desire to find where broken promises heal" dilute perceptual specificity; no dialogue present to test subtext or voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to grow more turbulent," "seemed to reach a crescendo") in the border-crossing climax dull immediacy; paraphrase loops ("thunderstorm inside raged"/"fury still raging") create scaffold without pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar magical-delivery premise gains modest freshness through cobalt arcade and drone border, but "thunderstorm in a bottle" trope lacks transformative specificity; emotional truth feels generic despite competent execution of atmospheric risk-taking.</comment>
