<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("emotional numbness") rather than embodied contradiction; clone custody battle remains abstract backstory with no on-page cost manifestation. Final "gratitude" feels unearned without visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds but cost proof fails: no legible forfeiture or endurance cost in closure beat. History-rewriting backdrop creates disorientation debt despite early anchors, weakening pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Floating dojo setting lacks tactical constraint; brain jar functions as static symbol rather than micro-setting that charges choices. Sensory details remain visual-dominant without urgency-filtered specificity during peak tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("emotional numbness") with no dramatized cost escalation. History-rewriting timeframe exerts zero pressure on decisions; "vivify" action lacks concrete tactics. Resolution feels unearned without visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "complementary opposites" practice, but final "gratitude" moralizes rather than reweighting prior material. Avoids overt sermonizing but lacks conceptual cost in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV control is stable with distinct meditative rhythm, but "felt a surge of determination" etc. repetitions create template cadence under pressure. Perceptual signature weakens during high-tension beats with generic interiority phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague key beats ("numbness that had plagued... threatened to consume him"). Filter-verb stacks ("Kaito felt... felt... felt") in final paragraph dull immediacy despite otherwise clean prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloning tech with Zen practice elevates tropes, but emotional resolution lacks bold risk-taking. Transformation test passes through specific "floating dojo" framing, though closure avoids meaningful cost.</comment>
