<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between reticence and resolve surfaces through ink-stained fingers and weathered innocence, but "weathered innocence" risks stock phrasing; micro-choices like retrieving the crystal show value hierarchy with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the crystal’s glow reconfigures silence into determination with conceptual cost (surrendering isolation), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) persists past midpoint, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library’s "suspended hush" and crystal constrain choices (e.g., drumming fingers amplify tension), charging the final image; sensory specificity in "scent of wet earth" avoids cliché while reflecting scholarly urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the scholar’s agency: decoding growth patterns versus testifying creates authentic tension, but "after last dictionary printed" lacks tactical pressure; cost (safety loss) is legible yet underdeveloped in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—crystal’s silence versus city sounds reweights "pattern of growth" without moralizing—but secondary stake (unraveling world) remains abstract, diluting thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("yellowed pages with intensity and detachment") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from oppressive silence to "symphony of new beginnings" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, but "weathered innocence" and "red-rimmed from lack of sleep" verge on bodily clichés; final third avoids artifacts though "sonically reflective" slightly drifts lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of scholarly isolation and sonic motifs feels fresh, but "after last dictionary printed" leans toward derivative post-apocalyptic framing; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
