<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("whispers of hidden truth") without contradictory impulses; embodied emotion limited to repeated "serenely electric" label. Final choice lacks visible cost despite nostalgia for lost era.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation fails: 120 words in, "abandoned radio tower city suspended over gorge" remains spatially vague with no functional disorientation payoff. Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "lifelong journey" moralizing undermines earned resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone, rust creaking) anchor atmosphere but setting never constrains choices. Radio towers function as passive backdrop; gorge's presence remains decorative despite early prominence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No coherent escalation under Accumulative lens. "Shard of hush" lacks tangible stakes—pressure dissolves into abstract "beauty in decay" without narrowing options or paying price. Lunar perigee serves as mood marker only.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of "hidden truths" stated overtly in final paragraph ("art of discovery was lifelong journey"), triggering thematic echo penalty. Beauty-in-decay concept remains untested by concrete loss or moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in celestial signal metaphors, but "serenely electric" repetition creates filter-verb stack. Focalization consistent though emotional intensity lacks syntactic modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("atmosphere alive with anticipation... serenely electric") and template cadence ("As she..., she...") in high-pressure beats. Final image dulled by redundant "magic beyond perception" after established closure attempt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" offers fresh lens but derivative radio-tower-ruins trope. Emotional truth undermined by abstract epiphanies; specificity (Hollywood fragment) lacks transformative integration with premise.</comment>
