<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; "richly perceptive" trait lacks embodied cost or tradeoffs. Flawless emotional calibration under cosmic pressure feels artificial—no degradation of thought during peak singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No felt cost at closure: dawn brings peace, not sacrifice. "Journey continues" undermines Earned Stasis; unresolved mystery isn't closure without foreclosed path. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus constrains movement through "canyon echo" premise. Whispering seashell (micro-setting) charges final image—warmth fading with dawn—but generic "universe hum" dilutes specificity. Avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("learn why some echo") remain abstract; no on-page cost or narrowing of options. "Webs of intrigue" concept never pressures tactics—coincidence (shell warming) complicates but doesn't deepen conflict under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Thematic Echo in final paragraph: "sought to learn why some people echo" states thesis verbatim. Resonance undermined by abstract resolution; "truth beyond reach" avoids concrete cost reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "reed-blown melancholy" voice, but syntactic monotony in high-pressure beats ("her voice weaving... creating... drawing"). No head-hopping, yet psychic distance never shifts under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Synonym churn in peak beats: "whispers/murmurs/vibrates" cluster creates paraphrase loops. Overwriting in "serpentine nexus under starlight" opening—redundant lyricism dulls momentum without advancing stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tropes (mystic singer, magical object) lack transformation; "echoes = soul labyrinth" is familiar. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure fails—lyric density doesn't heighten stakes. Derivative of archetypal "singer heals community" narratives.</comment>
