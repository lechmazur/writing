<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("confront the walls around her heart") dominates peak beats without embodied cost; no contradictory impulses shown during pivotal pearl interaction, reducing interiority to abstract reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: "dissolved walls" is asserted not dramatized; Accumulative lens fails as "latent radiance" repetitions accumulate texture without reweighting stakes or altering tactics in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crystal caves described vividly but function as static backdrop; no environmental constraint on choices (e.g., navigation challenges) or final image charge beyond generic "gentle glow" reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("hopes and fears") with zero escalation; no tightening of options or knowledge shift under Accumulative lens—pearl discovery to enlightenment follows predictable emotional arc without pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Explicit moralizing ("power to connect with others lay within") in final paragraph replaces earned resonance; "beacon of hope" cliché states theme rather than reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV consistency undermined by filter-verb saturation ("felt," "seemed") in high-pressure beats; "resonant hush" repetition creates paraphrase loop without rhythmic purpose during emotional climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("latent radiance" ×3, "resonant hush" ×2) clutter peak beats; final line's generic "hidden wonders" symbolism lacks textural specificity to charge closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative magical-object trope (pearl as emotional vessel) with no fresh inflection; transformation test fails—swap "pearl" for "crystal" and story logic unchanged, lacking specific lived detail.</comment>
