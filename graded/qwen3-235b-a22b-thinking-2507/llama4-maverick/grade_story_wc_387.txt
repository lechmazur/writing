<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; passive contemplation substitutes for meaningful choice under pressure. "Scintillatingly somber" remains label-only without tradeoffs, and realization lacks visible cost beyond abstract gratitude. No micro-choices test her appreciation of hidden effort during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: her grasp of hidden patterns crystallizes stance with felt cost in demure audacity's quiet vulnerability. Orientation anchors within 120 words, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—pressure remains atmospheric rather than narrowing options. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through patterned firefly/moon imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its return as talisman during revelation constrains her contemplation. Fireflies' patterned dance actively mirrors her internal state, evolving from decoration to embodied cost in the heartbeat echo. Selective sensory details (wet earth, whispering stone) perfectly filter through her net-mender perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering hidden patterns) lacks tangible pressure; no narrowing of options or meaningful trade-offs during escalation. Firefly patterns merely reflect rather than challenge her pursuit, and the "cost" of demure audacity remains abstract. Agency manifests as passive observation, not decision or endurance that forecloses paths with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through fireflies' shifting significance—from ethereal glow to heartbeat echo—reweighting "hidden patterns" without moralizing. Final image (fireflies whispering secrets) resonates as non-literal answer to her quest, avoiding tidy resolution while honoring complexity. No thematic statements; wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the whisk's return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "scintillatingly somber" rhythm and net-mender lexicon ("fabric of reality," "meshes"). Prose modulates beautifully from melancholy tune to serene clarity, though "demure audacity" strains as authorial intrusion. Zero head-hopping; compression in moon-path sequence taught early and paid off in closure's crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("hidden patterns" repeated 4x) and occasional overwriting ("ethereal glow," "soothing serenade") dull momentum in middle beats. High density otherwise—bamboo whisk description advances character/theme simultaneously. Final line's firefly "whisper" avoids sentimentality through concrete image, but template cadence in garden walk slightly impedes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending philosophy with firefly bioluminescence avoids nature-writing clichés through occupational specificity. Transformation test passed: swapping "whispering parapet" for generic balcony would break the tactile logic of her journey. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making the quiet closure feel inevitable.</comment>
