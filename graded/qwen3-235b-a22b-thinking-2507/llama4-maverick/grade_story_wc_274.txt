<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("reverence and rebellion") shown via micro-choices like thawing the pod, but final emotional resolution ("heart now at peace") feels tidied; "bravely conflicted" trait lacks visible tradeoffs during transmission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (monitoring screens as conversation unfolds) lands with conceptual cost ("difficult to control"), but causal lens wobbles: dormant networks appear deus ex machina without prior setup, weakening escalation logic at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Snow/library atmosphere vividly anchors mood ("flakes against windows," "serene veil"), but setting remains decorative; snow’s "delicate balance" metaphor never constrains Aria’s actions or charges the final image beyond generic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from discovery to transmission under causal lens, but "dormant networks" method breaks causality—it’s introduced late with no setup, resolving the problem it didn’t help create, diluting the felt cost of dissemination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truths emerges through the letter’s transmission, but final paragraph moralizes ("given voice to a silence") with prompt-like language, triggering Thematic Echo penalty; complexity undermined by "world would never be the same" abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV voice consistent with archivist precision ("practiced intensity," "danced across labels"), but filter verbs ("Aria realized," "she knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats like reading the letter, reducing embodied tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose loops with synonym churn ("serene quiet" → "no longer still" → "whispers mingled with murmurs") and stock metaphors ("dark confession"); "bravely conflicted heart" label violates diagnostic-speak rule in peak transmission beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-revolutionary elevates trope, but "dormant networks" method feels like safety-hedged convenience; specificity anchors universals well yet avoids bold risk in the closure’s controlled chaos.</comment>
