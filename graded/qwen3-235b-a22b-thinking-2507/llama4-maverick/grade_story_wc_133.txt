<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe") without embodied contradiction; obsession drives action but no genuine struggle alters tactics under pressure, leaving final "closure" unearned by micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but conceptual cost ("weight of convergence") lacks visceral legibility; rain-trail pattern break reweights stakes yet final image avoids tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tidal island’s rain trails actively constrain choices (revealing markings), charging the brooch’s final glow; specificity in "crumbling buildings" and sensory decay grounds theme without tourist-catalog detachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through brooch’s convergence link, but pressure lacks tightening trade-offs—art exchange raises intellectual risk without measurable cost altering later tactics, missing Band 8.8+ requirement for visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trauma/art emerges through brooch’s shifting resonance ("desolate to alive with meaning"), avoiding moralizing; final "secrets beneath surface" image reweights convergence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Painter’s perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("intricate patterns dance"), but abstract emotional labels ("haggard awe") disrupt embodied voice during peak pressure with the stranger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflective blocks ("searching for inspiration... stumbled upon") slows momentum; strong verbs offset generic phrases like "weight of the convergence," though final image avoids closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh tidal-island ruin setting elevates water-war tropes, but "unearthed convergence" concept lacks transformative specificity; brooch’s symbolic weight feels derivative despite credible emotional truth in artistic obsession.</comment>
