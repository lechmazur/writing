<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("salvage truth") is abstractly stated but lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost; "weaves truth carefully" trait remains label-only without driving concrete choices. No earned change or endurance with on-page forfeiture; emotional progression flattens into generic wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation fails: "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" concept isn't anchored within 120 words, muddying comprehension. Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no specific forfeiture or tactical alteration; "weight of mission" remains conceptual. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) not taught early enough.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ice shrine and snow globe offer vivid sensory texture but function as postcard backdrop—no constraint on choices (e.g., melting ice doesn't force haste). Micro-setting potential wasted; "borrowed starlight" modulates tone but doesn't charge final image with specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("salvage truth") never face concrete testing—pressure accumulates passively through visions without narrowing options. No protagonist-driven escalation; "windows opening" feels coincidental, not earned by agency. Cost remains abstract ("weight of mission") without visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme ("truth in wreckage") succumbs to overt moralizing: final lines explicitly state "darkness didn't seem so overwhelming" and "connections that bound the world," violating organic emergence. Thematic echo in closing paragraph triggers penalty; no resonant non-literal answer reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice has poetic consistency ("candlelight danced across the ice") but lacks character-particular perceptual signature—prose remains generically lyrical under stress. Avoids major pitfalls but rhythmic control doesn't modulate with pressure; abstract labels ("sense of wonder") dilute immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "a trail of candlelight and the faintest hint of starlight" stacks modifiers. Paraphrase loops ("salvage something pure from the wreckage" repeated verbatim) and template cadence ("As she...") dull propulsion. Final third artifacts disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tropes (ghost whisperer, snow globe visions) feel derivative—melting globe as "windows of connection" lacks fresh inflection. Emotional truth remains generic ("love and loss"); transformation test fails (swap "glacier" for "forest," story unchanged). No risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
