<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains observational; Kael's bloodhound perspective lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. "Felt belonging" tells without embodied cost. Lyra's motivation stays abstract despite "translate distance" phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("long arduous journey," "heavy with creosote"). Causal lens holds but riddle solution relies on convenient nudge rather than earned causality. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Scrapyard setting provides vivid atmosphere but fails Q3 9+ gate: environment doesn't constrain choices (spring found by luck). Wax orb functions as micro-setting but doesn't charge closure image beyond symbolic glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("revitalize wasteland") but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency. Journey's physical cost is felt, yet pressure isn't narrowed by choices—Lyra solves riddle via sudden realization without struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through spring discovery without moralizing. Final image reweights "desolate" as beautiful but "translate distance" concept remains abstract. Avoids thematic echo despite lyrical phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV consistent with bloodhound sensory focus ("nose twitching"), but human emotions bleed into canine perspective ("Kael felt belonging"). "An surge" grammatical error disrupts voice. No dialogue to test subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("creosote and ash") but "wild hush" repeats without modulation. Minor scaffold: "Lyra felt an surge" and "deep sense of connection" use abstract phrasing. No critical loops in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh bloodhound protagonist elevates familiar wasteland trope. Wax-sealed leaf adds novelty but "tinted revelations" concept feels derivative. Emotional truth in quiet ending, though risk-taking remains constrained by predictable renewal arc.</comment>
