<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; motivation clear but no visible cost or struggle. "Restless energy" and "inner light" are label-only emotions without embodied conflict. Final endurance lacks earned stakes despite clear goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost under Accumulative lens. "Chest heaving" is physical exertion but no reweighted stake—cloud interpretation succeeds effortlessly. Blue hour deepening doesn't constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and mallet constrain action (orchard as instrument) and charge final image ("driftwood creaked softly"). Sensory specificity ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") avoids white-room syndrome while serving texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No tangible escalation: "turn obstacles into instruments" faces zero resistance. Orchards yield music effortlessly; blue hour deepening is backdrop not pressure. Stakes remain abstract despite dense atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme ("hidden harmony") stated via "restless euphony" rather than earned. Final jewel image is resonant but doesn't reweight prior material—avoids complexity with serene resolution. Abstract claims undercut specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cloud patterns as "hidden harmony") with rhythmic control matching music's complexity. Final paragraph's repetitive "The [noun]..." structure prevents 9.0 despite strong voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"The prophet's eyes sparkled... The prophet's eyes shone" is paraphrase loop. "Restless euphony" repetition borders on thematic echo. Strong propulsion otherwise, but scaffolding dulls closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh micro-setting (orchard on driftwood) lacks emotional transformation. "Fractal generating" feels tacked-on; premise (artist finding music in nature) works unchanged with generic setting. Specific details avoid middle-ground hedging.</comment>
