<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; "luminous regret" remains abstract label without embodied tradeoffs during pivotal shadow realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works but cost feels conceptual rather than visible; river stone warmth lacks tangible sacrifice to ground the "shape of hope" preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Blooming library functions as micro-setting: cloud-soft floor and luminescent orbs constrain movement and perception during footage study, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope) signaled early but pressure never tightens; shadow threat remains observational without altering tactics beyond passive noticing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river stone's evolving resonance, but "luminous regret" summary in final paragraph undermines earned ambiguity with near-moralizing abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed," "softly deliberate") persists under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's cloud-merging imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwritten sensory density ("sweet scent of parchment," "luminescent orbs") creates minor scaffold; "danced across yellowed paper" muddles action with metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing tech with ethereal library setting, but "shadow unbound" trope lacks specific transformation beyond generic existential threat.</comment>
