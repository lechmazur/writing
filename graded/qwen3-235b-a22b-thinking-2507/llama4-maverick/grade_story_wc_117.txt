<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("cautious exuberance," "nurture lifelong wonder") undermines embodied emotion; Eli’s transformation lacks contradictory impulses or visible cost, rendering motivation abstract despite thematic coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: Eli’s "awe" is asserted without legible consequence ("she had done her job" declares success but shows no trade-off), violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for felt cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s sensory details (sage breeze, dreaming roots) anchor atmosphere effectively, but the eclipse’s impossible timing ("moon creep across sun at sunset") breaks credibility, preventing environment from constraining choices or charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("link people to the world") remains abstract; the eclipse triggers wonder but introduces no pressure that narrows options or forces a trade-off, failing to escalate beyond passive observation despite poetic setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through sensory threads but resolves into tidy moralizing ("fragile beauty easily lost") in the climax, undercutting complexity with asserted insight rather than earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV voice is lyrical but overwrites with generic metaphors ("stars twinkling like diamonds"); compression works early but collapses under pressure with therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance"), diluting Aria’s distinct perceptual signature during the eclipse peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she played...", "As the shadows deepened...") and stock metaphors ("hush of dreaming roots") proliferate; filter-verb stacks in the closure beat ("Eli's face was alight") dull immediacy, disqualifying 9+ per artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transforms music therapy tropes via eclipse framing, but "ordinary magic" concept relies on familiar lyricism without fresh emotional specificity; derivative premise guardrail applies due to safety-hedged abstraction ("fragile beauty" cliché).</comment>
