<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; grief-to-peace transition is linear without authentic irrationality. "Steely longing" label in climax triggers -0.5 penalty. Micro-choices absent under pressure; compasses/film act upon her rather than revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation failure: "tidal arbor above the clouds" remains spatially unanchored past 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost in "steely longing" and frozen clock, but lens ambiguity early nearly caps score. Accumulative pressure holds at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail fails 9+ gate: no environment/tool constrains choices. Film reel mechanics matter but arbor remains postcard backdrop. "Wet stone and ozone" scent lacks causal role. White-room syndrome in film realm undermines spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (escaping grief) signaled early but escalation passive; protagonist follows compasses/film rather than driving pressure. No visible price paid during film transition. Band guardrail violation: 8.0+ requires foreclosed option, but refuge lacks tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through film-clock interplay, but "journey not destination" statement near closure triggers -0.3 thematic echo penalty. Final image reweights frozen clock effectively, though "surprise fate" motivation remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("compasses like fireflies," "music swirled like tide") shines, but filter-verb stacks ("gaze drifted," "realized she was being drawn") accumulate near climax. Voice modulates well with emotional intensity despite minor register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but "mist swirled" repetition creates subtle textural redundancy. Final paragraph's "surprise fate... outrun pain... new path" exhibits template cadence. Avoids major artifacts though density slightly muddles climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms station-pianist trope via cloud arbor/film mechanics, but "broken clock = frozen grief" feels overused. Risk-taking with film-as-refuge succeeds; swapping "film reel" for "mirror" would break hidden-sections logic. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
