<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in guilt versus healing feels authentic, but "translates baby cries" is stated not demonstrated; diagnostic label "dissonance of old guilt" triggers -0.4 penalty during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dawn peace) lands with felt cost of lifted guilt, but amber's glow lacks causal link to resolution; lens ambiguity at midpoint (-0.3) caps score despite solid Accumulative/Textural escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Laboratory setting constrains choices via haunted firmware and meteor hush; sandalwood/myrrh scents and flickering candles charge final image, though antique dresser's introduction feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through firmware whispers escalating to time-folding, but "baby cries" attribute resolves guilt without visible trade-off; tightening via tethering cord lacks prior causal setup under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-to-peace emerges through constellation tattoos absorbing dissonance, but "new path through complexities of human heart" borders on thematic echo; final meteor hush cooing avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("needles dancing," "susurrus of stars") modulates under pressure; however, uniform lyrical cadence during time-folding creates subtle drumbeat rhythm in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in "shadows twisting like living things" followed by "time folding" creates mixed metaphors in pressure beat; paraphrase loop in "gentle susurrus... weight of stars" triggers -0.3 density penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo art as emotional conduit avoids trope clichés, but "amber talisman" relies on familiar mystical object; meteor hush as transformative silence earns +0.3 risk distinction for coherent tonal evolution.</comment>
