<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but interiority remains abstract; "sense of disconnection" lacks embodied contradiction. Final choice lacks earned struggle—device activation succeeds flawlessly without visible cost or competing impulses. Micro-choices absent under pressure; actions feel preordained rather than tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with communal wonder, but causality breaks: device functions perfectly on first try with no obstacles. Accumulative/Textural lens fits, yet escalation lacks pressure—villagers gather instantly without resistance. Cost remains conceptual (longing remedied) but no felt price on the page weakens closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Verdant arbor described lyrically but functions as static backdrop; no environmental constraint on choices (e.g., dew doesn't hinder mechanics). Vine tendril evolves meaningfully yet fails to alter tactics—its golden pulse merely mirrors success. Strong sensory detail lacks causal pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring connection) signaled early but never tested—no resistance from villagers or mechanical failure. Pressure evaporates when melody "worked" instantly; resolution lacks trade-offs or visible cost. Stakes remain abstract despite lyrical payoff, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of communal reconnection emerges organically through song-device fusion, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("faces aglow with connection") offers resonant non-literal answer to disconnection. But lacks complexity—no counter-readings or moral ambiguity, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory cadence ("dew clung to leaves," "hum of awakening insects") modulates under pressure. Filter verbs acceptable for lyrical voice, yet "golden stories" abstraction dilutes immediacy. Consistent focalization but peak-beat compression lacks rhythmic variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm falters with scaffolding: "a haunting, lilting tune that seemed to capture..." overwrites melody's impact. Synonym churn in communal scenes ("curiosity and longing," "communal wonder") dulls immediacy. Final image avoids closure artifacts but mid-scene loops cap high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Trope of reviving traditions executed competently but lacks fresh inflection—no transformation of familiar elements through specific stakes (e.g., why *these* songs matter uniquely). Emotional truth present yet derivative; "vine catalyst" feels archetypal rather than indispensable. Safety-middle choices avoid bold risk.</comment>
