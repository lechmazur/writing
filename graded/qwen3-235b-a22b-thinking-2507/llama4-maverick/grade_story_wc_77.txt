<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Protagonist remains passive vessel; motivation ("trick fear") lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Whispering advisor drives action, not character's internal conflict. No visible cost beyond generic dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory escalation, but closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost. "Forever marked" is abstract; no specific price paid beyond psychological unease. Orientation solid early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid decay-luminescence contrast creates potent atmosphere. Funhouse setting described with sensory precision but fails to constrain choices or charge final image per 9+ gate. Micro-setting (cloak clasp) lacks tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (survival vs. allure) signaled early, pressure deepens via luminance intensity. Escalation driven by environment, not protagonist agency. Cost remains abstract; no tangible forfeiture or tactical shift from "tricking fear" motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of fear/allure emerges through imagery but lacks resonant closure. Final line moralizes ("always waiting") without reweighting prior material. No non-literal answer to central question; epiphany feels unearned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in decay/luminance focus. Voice modulates effectively under pressure but "photographically cursed" phrasing breaks POV lexicon. No head-hopping; consistent first-person intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm in opening beats, but "whispering advisor's voice" repetition (7x) creates paraphrase loops. "Repulsive allure" and "morbid curiosity" verge on stock phrasing. Final paragraph cadence shift lacks payoff density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tropes (haunted funhouse, cursed object) executed competently but lack fresh inflection. "Lingering luminance" offers slight novelty yet fails transformation test—swap "funhouse" for "mansion" with minimal changes.</comment>
