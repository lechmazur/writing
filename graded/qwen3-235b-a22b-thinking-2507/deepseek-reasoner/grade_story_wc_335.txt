<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s "combative tenderness" manifests in concrete micro-choices (stopping retreat, pressing fingers to shard) with visible cost; Kael’s backward walking embodies internal conflict but lacks deeper contradiction beyond retreat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: annotation reverses exile with felt cost (Kael’s flinch, solidified form). Causal lens holds—tea leaf/shadow analysis directly triggers fracture-point revelation without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The teacup’s shadow constrains the climax (tracing fracture point) and charges the final image (swing as witness). Sensory details like "chaotic web of cracks" filter through Elara’s archivist precision without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: leaf-shadow intersection forces Kael to confront his concession point. Visible cost in his flinch and the irreversible solidification—agency lies in choosing to "stay" rather than flee.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: resilience as "choosing the harder, truer thing" reweights the swing’s drift in the final image without moralizing. No thematic echo; subtext lives in Kael’s backward steps versus forward annotation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s "sharp eyes missing nothing" shapes sensory selection (shadow paths, leaf veins). Rhythm accelerates during memory immersion ("bitter argument, cruel word") without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadow’s path on the cup’s exterior" integrates setting/action with crystalline clarity. Final line’s "quiet victory" recharges the swing motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea leaves as "fluid geometry" transforms exile tropes through specific mechanics (shadow-leaf intersection). Emotional truth in Kael’s nervous trait avoids quirkiness; risk-taking heightens stakes via quiet annotation.</comment>
