<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of time" is embodied in her tender observation of tidal life, avoiding stock phrasing. Her micro-choice to deflect via the grotto reveals contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. connection), and Aric's shift from anger to awe earns the fragile reconciliation through prior causality ("hiding place" to "observatory"). No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: the tide-turning exit crystallizes their "new and cautious understanding" with visible cost in the "fragile" third path. Orientation is anchored by word 40 ("tidal-pool chronicler... failing partnership"). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the vision's density shift reweights stakes through bioluminescent flaring and obsidian water, with cost legible in "fragile and new" compromise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The jade cicada and grotto function as micro-setting that constrains choice (tide urgency) and charges the final image ("totem of possibility"). Sensory details are purpose-driven: "wet quartz" smell enables the reflective pool, while "obsidian" water directly facilitates foresight. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile specificity ("cool green surface against warm skin").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency: her tangential deflection ("pointed to a fissure") forces stance crystallization via the cicada vision. The dominant stake (relationship survival) tightens as the vision presents three futures with felt cost—the "fragile" path requires mutual compromise. Under Accumulative lens, the bioluminescent flare deepens options with undeniable emotional price ("content but alone" vs. "bitter compromise").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "texture of time" reframed from tidal biology to emotional transition via the cicada's hydrologist purpose. Final image ("totem not of rain, but of possibility") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Aric's "observatory" line is earned through the grotto's reflective water, not abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature shines: she notices "frantic dance of transparent shrimp" while others see chaos. Voice modulates under stress—clinical to tender ("warmly observant... profound struggle"). Dialogue carries subtext ("hiding place" vs. "observatory") with engineer/chronicler lexicon distinctions. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. "Became perfectly still, a sheet of obsidian" avoids simultaneity errors while compressing time. Figurative language is sparse but potent ("stalling between them like a becalmed ship"), never muddying the climax. Final line's rhythm ("stars above wheeled") crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms the "magical object" trope through hydrologist specificity—the cicada's monsoon-measuring purpose makes the emotional foresight inevitable. Fresh synthesis: tidal chronicle as lens for relationship transition. Bold risk in quiet closure (Charged Poise) heightens stakes through "fragile" compromise, avoiding generic reconciliation. No derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
