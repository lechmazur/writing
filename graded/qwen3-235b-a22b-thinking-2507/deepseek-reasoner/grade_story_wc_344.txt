<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation "rhythm of repair" concretely drives gear assembly; embodied emotion in mirror reflections avoids abstraction. No interior contradiction limits higher score despite flawless micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "light softened, warming to gentle gold" reconfigures reality with felt cost in "rhythm... beat softly in her chest." Accumulative lens holds from fractured reflections to gear assembly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains choice (fractured ice path) and charges final image (thawing without damage). "Hauntingly bright light" evolves from discomfort to warmth, directly shaping the climax's emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through mirror reflections forcing self-confrontation; gear assembly narrows options to one alignment. Cost is visceral in "driftwood nostalgia" transforming to present-tense wholeness, though escalation lacks secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear materials (moonstone/shadow) embodying unity of opposites; final image reweights "rhythm of repair" as internal cadence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "light that illuminated but did not comfort"; rhythmic control peaks with "moonstone meshed with shadow, brass whispered to wood." No POV slippage despite reflective density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Breath plumed before her" avoids cliché through precise verbs; zero synonym loops. Slight register drift in "profound sense of driftwood nostalgia" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "lunar locksmith" trope through tactile gear physics; specificity of "petrified wood/whispering brass" creates emotional truth. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
