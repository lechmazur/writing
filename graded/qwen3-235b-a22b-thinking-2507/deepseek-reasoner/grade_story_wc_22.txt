<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation (reclaiming the battlefield through seeds) intensifies believably when the bird forces adaptation; embodied emotion in "heart a frantic drum" avoids labels. "Speaks dead languages" trait lacks causal constraint on actions, slightly undercutting interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: green shoots emerging with the bird’s sentinel role reconfigures "submerged concord" with felt cost (poisoned soil’s resistance). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when Elias repurposes seeds for the bird, narrowing options under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jetty’s skeletal structure actively constrains choices (seeds planted in rock clefts), and the seed pods charge the final image. "Brittle, bleached coral" underfoot shapes tactics early; by closure, the jetty holds "the vastness of a new world," fulfilling the 9+ gate through micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the bird’s plight forces Elias to abandon ritual for immediate care, crystallizing his stance: feeding creatures *is* feeding the earth. Agency drives escalation (crumbling seeds for soil mix), but the bird’s arrival edges toward coincidence-complication rather than pure causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The final shoots reweight "garden reclaiming battlefield" from literal act to resonant metaphor without moralizing. Theme emerges through the seed-bird pact’s reciprocity ("droppings nourish seeds"), avoiding abstraction—Elias’s quiet departure listening for "living call" answers the central question through image, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence... a hollow roar," "papery things, each a tiny ark") modulates with emotion; syntax tightens under pressure ("He carried it back... poured water"). No head-hopping, and lyric compression ("indigo bleeding into horizon") is taught early and paid off in closure’s visual rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rattling, papery things" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "desperate, rhythmic chirping" slightly dilutes high-pressure beat, but final paragraph’s propulsion ("sprinkling... gentle rain of potential") maintains clarity and density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms eco-grief tropes through the seed-bird pact—a fresh inflection where renewal hinges on interspecies reciprocity. Emotional truth in "fertilized by chance and necessity" avoids generic hope; specificity ("dried grubs saved for supper") grounds universality without abstraction.</comment>
