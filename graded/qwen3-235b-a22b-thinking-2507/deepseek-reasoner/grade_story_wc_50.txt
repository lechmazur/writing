<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (contemplative urgency) via micro-choices like timing reflection studies; embodied emotion through tactile repair work avoids therapy-speak. Lacks deeper tension about using wonder now versus storing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise RR: device activation crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("world would need to remember its own lost music"). Causal lens holds flawlessly; cost legible in final image without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marble cavern functions as indispensable micro-setting: acoustics constrain every choice (reflection angles) and directly cause climax via sonic convergence. Final image charged by quartz lens sourced from walls—environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (storing wonder for wounded world) tightens through protagonist agency: reflection studies narrow options to harmonic convergence. Conceptual cost undeniable in closure, but escalation lacks secondary pressure layer to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "captured wonder in a machine of reason" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to "storing wonder" question, though tension between reason/wonder could deepen subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: locksmith notices angles/reflections, not emotions. Rhythmic control falters slightly in technical passages (e.g., semicolon overuse during gear repair), but POV consistency under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("light bled a deep, melancholic gold"). One hairline slip: "slow metronome" slightly redundant. Figurative language precise even in peak activation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reflective locksmith" transforms echo-harvesting trope through occupational specificity. Risk-taking (acoustics as causal mechanism) heightens stakes, but "wounded season" phrasing lacks ultimate freshness for 9.0.</comment>
