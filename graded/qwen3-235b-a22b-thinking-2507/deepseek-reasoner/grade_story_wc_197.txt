<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("cold dread," "heart hammered") but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; "simple and fierce" motivation is clear but slightly abstract without deeper flaw exploration. Final choice to run toward light earns endurance with visceral cost (drainage culvert).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: running toward searchlight forecloses safety with felt cost (filth, breath-holding). Situational lens holds—environmental pressure (lagoon, skiff) forces stance crystallization. Minor deduction: phone booth's sudden appearance risks convenience despite setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains escape route and charges closure ("toxic beauty" mirroring erased history). Puddle reflections actively guide navigation, not just backdrop. Salt/rust smell and oily water details filter through urgency, avoiding generic dystopia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: dead-drop loss → puddle navigation → lagoon evasion. Patrol skiff tightens stakes, forcing choice with visceral cost (drainage filth). Dominant stake ("tyranny of indifference") tested through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: key as "coded freedom," lagoon as erased history. Final image ("keeper of the map") reweights "memory" without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence—Curators' indifference isn't sympathized, and toxic beauty rejects tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices liquid reflections as maps, chemical beauty. Syntax tightens under pressure ("Panic was a luxury"). Minor flaw: "simple and fierce" abstraction early on, but voice modulates effectively from dread to resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "neon signs... looked like lines" does triple duty (setting/method/theme). Final line's "hold the line" callback charges closure without overwriting. Density flawless—every phrase advances plot or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via specific details (puddle navigation, auric lagoon). Emotional truth in quiet resistance avoids middle-ground hedging. Risk-taking with situational closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
