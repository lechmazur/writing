<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via micro-choices (hand on chest, watching wing) but epiphany lacks visceral struggle; emotional embodiment stays abstract ("jarring/affirming" thump) without deeper flaw engagement. Dye master functions solely as catalyst, not rounded character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the heart's thump creates undeniable conceptual cost ("host to strange attraction") while mist-swirl final image crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Accumulative lens held perfectly through light-density escalation; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating tea house isn't backdrop but active constraint—mist modulates sunlight essential to the wing's illumination. Morpho wing as micro-setting directly charges closure ("captured sky, pulsing with latent energy" → "wonder-filled grasp" finale).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through light-density accumulation: each sun-trail manipulation deepens Elara's understanding with visible cost (the thump). Agency lies in her shift from seeking answers to accepting the heart's legacy, though conceptual cost could resonate more physically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from morpho wing's science—light refraction as story-perception—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("mist swirled... wonder-filled grasp") reweights "iridescent caution" into resonant non-literal answer without stating the moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing light fractures, not colors) with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor syntax hiccup ("method by tracking sun trails") barely dents otherwise impeccable voice modulation during epiphany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "iridescent caution a silent sermon" shows not tells. Figurative language serves theme (light as stories), though "method by tracking" has slight syntactic friction. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "donor heart" trope via morpho wing's structural color science. Fresh angle: stories aren't magnetized but refracted through perception. Emotional truth in quiet acceptance avoids cliché, though risk-taking stays lyrical rather than structural.</comment>
