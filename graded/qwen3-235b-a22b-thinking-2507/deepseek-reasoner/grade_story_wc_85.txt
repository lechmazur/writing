<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (trembling hands weaving lies), but client remains underdeveloped as pressure vessel; emotional progression avoids therapy-speak yet secondary character lacks causal weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("a silencing") under Accumulative/Textural lens; "deep, tempered regret" crystallizes felt cost while maintaining pattern integrity through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and watch hand function as micro-setting constraining choices—shore walk focuses Elara's mind, brass artifact charges final image with "minuscule weight" becoming moral burden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she confronts the watch's truth; "hands trembled" crystallizes the trade-off between client's peace and buried reality with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the watch hand's dual meaning; final line reweights "solace" into "silencing" without moralizing, achieving resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sieved hush," "fragments of broken things") modulates rhythm under pressure; voice maintains consistent focalization while compressing backstory through driftwood metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "minuscule weight a profound pressure" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "silencing" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory-manipulation trope through genealogist lens; "manufactures false memories" premise gains freshness via tactile artifacts and moral calculus that avoids safety-hedging.</comment>
