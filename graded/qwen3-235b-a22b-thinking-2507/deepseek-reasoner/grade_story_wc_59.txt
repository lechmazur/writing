<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "succeeded and failed in the same moment" shows embodied conflict, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during high-pressure assembly. Micro-choices like trembling hands reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: assembly → activation → spectral emergence → city response. Cost is legible in "tears cutting clean paths through the grime" as Earned Stasis crystallizes his flawed genesis realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended palace constrains choices (glass dome enabling spectral flight) and charges finale (brass flowers responding). Stalactite chains and calcified egg are micro-settings that directly shape tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation narrows options from "total failure" to imperfect miracle. Cost is unmistakable in kneeling tears and redefined success, with the spectral bird's emergence forcing stance crystallization under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass flowers turning toward song—not stated moral. Final image ("beauty that had finally answered its call") reweights "flawed genesis" without sentimentality, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tears cutting clean paths through the grime" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control modulates from "fervent, nervous energy" to "quaking reverie," with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass flower" and "calcified egg" achieve high density. No figurative muddle—final image's "bittersweet symphony" avoids therapy-speak while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "extinct creature revival" trope via spectral twist. Specificity of "brass automata blossoms" avoids genericness, with risk-taking (ghostly music awakening machines) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
