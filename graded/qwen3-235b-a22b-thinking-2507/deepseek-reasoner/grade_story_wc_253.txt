<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (rebellion via neutrality vs. grief) and embodied emotion (tear tracing path, whittling as physicalized mourning) elevate motivation beyond thematic statement. Micro-choices like snatching the bird reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak penalty as "cultivate lightness" is dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with unmistakable cost: "traitorous tear" and whittling until heart feels "smoothed" crystallize emotional weight. Accumulative lens holds through density shift when turbines halt, reweighting silence from threat to chosen quiet. Orientation clear by 50 words with kitchen/turbines mandate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Turbines and dried flowers function as micro-setting charging closure: motionless giants frame the fragile offering while brittle petals constrain kneeling act. Sensory details (grass whispering, vibrating hum) filter through whittler’s tactile focus, avoiding symbolic convenience. Final image reweights environment as blanket, not cage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs. mandate) tightens when silence forces authentic action, foreclosing neutrality with visible cost (tear, effort). Agency-driven escalation via kneeling and whittling redefines "lightness" as carved space within loss. Band guardrail met: tightening alters tactics (narration stops, authentic whittling begins).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "remade hush" from cage to blanket without moralizing, offering resonant answer through bone-dry petals and translucent bird. Theme emerges from whittling’s physicality—no abstract statements. Avoids thematic echo despite "cultivate lightness" phrasing through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details (calloused fingers, brittle bouquet), while rhythmic compression during silence ("He had to move, to act...") mirrors panic. Slight register drift in narration ("tribute to mandated nourishment") doesn’t undermine coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels narrative (e.g., "shavings collecting like pale tears" conveys grief and action). Figurative language sparse but precise; final lines ("not imposed, but chosen") crystallize closure without muddle. High density maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms happiness mandate trope through whittler’s quiet rebellion: turbines as clean energy symbol repurposed as emotional cage. Risk-taking in climax (no dialogue, internal shift) heightens stakes, though premise slightly familiar. Fresh inflection in "carving memory" physicalizing grief.</comment>
