<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in envy/pity toward past selves; embodied "bitter, acidic envy" avoids labels. Final choice to climb earned by witnessing erosion of resolve, but "chronologically confused" trait remains abstract rather than constraining specific action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: abandoning chronicling for climbing forecloses the resignation path. Accumulative lens holds through cadence shifts ("symphony of regret" to "one step at a time"), with the grave's conceptual cost crystallized in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll (micro-setting) constrains choice—its fragility mirrors her state, and leaving it behind charges the final image. Dust/foggy cabin air evolves from sensory detail to symbol of mental clutter, though mountain's "immense and silent" description edges toward generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through self-witnessing: jealousy curdles into pity as she sees her resolve erode. Agency drives escalation (choosing to inscribe the dream), with the grave's conceptual cost made undeniable in the final decision to reject resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "feral nostalgia" charging action—past selves aren't abstract but visceral triggers for change. Final climb reweights the chronicler's work without stating morals, though "tidying neurological lint" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veined like old skin," "symphony of regret") modulates under pressure. Voice stays anchored in Elara's lexicon—no corporate drift—even during high-stakes dream sequences where syntax compresses appropriately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bitter, acidic envy" exemplifies high-density phrasing. Final line’s cadence shift ("one step at a time") delivers propulsion without muddle, though "feral nostalgia" borders on thematic abstraction in one instance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "seeing your own grave" trope through specific chronicler lens and mountain setting. Emotional truth in envy/pity toward past selves feels fresh, though cabin setup risks genre convention without deeper occupational detail.</comment>
