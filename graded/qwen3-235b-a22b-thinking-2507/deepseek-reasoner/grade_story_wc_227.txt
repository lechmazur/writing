<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fool to believe shattered things could hold weight" vs action) and embodied emotion ("breath catching") create authentic tension; final choice earned through prior causality with visible cost in the charm's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("charm... solid gold"); Accumulative lens holds via rhythmic pressure escalation ("gear snapping," acid spray), though gear failure edges toward convenience despite thematic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Acid sea actively constrains choices (dissolving time) and charges final image ("golden light reflect on swirling surface"); micro-setting (statue/charm) directly shapes tactics and closure with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (matching pockmarks amid rising acid); cost legible in snapped gear and rising tide, though escalation relies slightly on external pressure versus character-driven narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "kintsugi intentions" action; final image reweights "dire enchantment" as enduring beauty without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence filled only by hiss... tick of clocks") with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and syntactic compression during crisis ("Gear snapping. Acid spraying.") serves urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid, golden script" integrates metaphor without muddling action; final line's "perfect stitch in the quilt" pays off motif with crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Kintsugi alchemy transforms trope through specific, grounded stakes; "uncertain alchemist" protagonist avoids sentimentality, and emotional truth elevates surface novelty into inevitable synthesis.</comment>
