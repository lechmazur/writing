<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s euthanasia-tourist motivation avoids therapy-speak through embodied contradiction ("brutal, beautiful sieve" of relief work) and micro-choices (clutching parasol tip). Final release earned by prior causality, but internal conflict lacks sufficient struggle pre-epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: ivory tip’s release crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("silence within oneself"). Accumulative lens holds; orientation anchors by line 3 ("creaking dock, frost-slick wood"). No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains every choice—parasol tip’s discovery in drafty hall, wind lifting ivory—and charges final image. Sensory specificity ("tectonic sigh," "dry snow rustle") mirrors internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing endings) deepens via parasol discovery into acceptance, narrowing options from "trawling" to release. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens, but cost (spiritual shift) slightly abstract for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through parasol’s reweighting: "windborne solace" crystallizes non-literal answer to "sound of endings." Zero moralizing; ambiguity lingers via old woman’s calm ("offering," not loss).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world a thin veneer over humming silence") modulates rhythm under pressure. No filter-verb clutter; syntax compresses during epiphany ("It was windborne solace").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soft, resonant clicks" of ice exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight overwriting in "brutal, beautiful sieve" (density dip), but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourist framed through disaster relief, not hospitals. Specificity (ivory parasol etched with swallows) avoids trope. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
