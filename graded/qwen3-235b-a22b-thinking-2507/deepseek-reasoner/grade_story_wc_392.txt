<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fortified vulnerability") drives choices, but "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats ("fortified vulnerability") triggers -0.5 penalty despite otherwise concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (carrying grief while rejecting bureaucratic closure); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through memory immersion and drought motif evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tunnel culvert physically constrains choice during climax; lantern as micro-setting charges final image; drought motif evolves from sensory detail to thematic weight without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Elara’s rejection of Department protocol; cost (permanent emotional burden) legible in her resolve; agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lantern placement and "investigate but remember" realization; avoids moralizing; final image reweights bureaucracy vs. human echoes without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghost of last week’s drought," "cough rattled deep"); rhythm shifts with memory intensity; no head-hopping despite entangled consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sooty glass panes" and "rattled deep in his chest" show textural specificity; minor register drift in "ghost of drought" costs 0.1 in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical trauma with bureaucratic present; lantern mechanics transform trope; risk-taking (memory vessel) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
