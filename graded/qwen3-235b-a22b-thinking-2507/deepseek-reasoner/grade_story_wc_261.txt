<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("closure seeker who only succeeded in opening wounds") embodied through pain-driven compulsion to examine coffee rings and tunnel crawl; final choice to share her story earns visible cost via reframing scars as "river of survival" rather than wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands unmistakably as scars glow against the orb with conceptual cost: "pain had not been a lock, but a key"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to the sand's fall, though tunnel discovery transition slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Coffee ring fractals constrain choice by triggering scar-topography method; final image charges the orb's "vacant" nature through reweighted coffee-ring entropy, fulfilling micro-setting gate with concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when plant whispers shift from "silent screams" to "deep, resonant wrongness" about roots touching void, forcing Elara's crawl; cost is legible in the orb's "displaced" purpose requiring her story to anchor it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar-coffee ring-orb triad without moralizing; final image ("share her story, and in doing so, give it a home") reweights "displaced miracle" as interdependence, avoiding tidy resolution through "vacant" orb's unresolved cosmic loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "silent scream of thirst erupted inside her skull" – plant telepathy filters all sensation; rhythmic control under pressure peaks in tunnel crawl ("subterranean map painted in sensations of pressure") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile, fractal patterns" and "smooth borehole" exemplify textural specificity without muddle; final beat ("pressed her glowing scars against the orb") delivers propulsion through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skin graft physics with coffee ring entropy as scar-reading method transforms trauma tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes via plant telepathy's "grating hum" without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
