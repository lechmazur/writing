<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction under pressure underdeveloped; "quietly inspired" state described not embodied with tradeoffs during cataloging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost as prophecy reframed; accumulative lens holds through cataloging-to-flipping causality. "Truth unravels" timeframe slightly vague but closure image recharges stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: its "unearthed silence" and dust constrain Elara’s meditative method, charging the final image where light/sand defy physics. Recurring hourglass frame directly enables flipping climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via cataloging—unused choices as inert weight threatening stoppage—but escalation relies on revelation rather than protagonist’s tactical adaptation under pressure. Cost is conceptual (prophecy reframed) not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lost buttons" motif: unused potential as weight reframes prophecy from endpoint to warning. Final image ("truth unravels into a beginning") offers CR without moralizing, reweighting "final grain" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metaphysical dust," "amber glow") filters sensory detail; rhythmic control tightens during cataloging. Minor register drift in "raw possibility" phrasing slightly jars poetic consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loop in "deep, meditative connection... profoundly inspired" dulls momentum; otherwise vivid verbs ("unscramble," "buoyed") and purposeful fragments. Final image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time tropes through "lost buttons" mechanics: cataloging unused choices as tangible weight reframes prophecy. Risk-taking in conceptual closure (upward-flowing sand) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
