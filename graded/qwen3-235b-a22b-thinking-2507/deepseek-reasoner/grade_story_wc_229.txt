<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation ("whispers travel farther than shouts") drives micro-choices (tucking vial, silent beckon) with embodied contradiction; head keeper’s underdevelopment caps score despite clean interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: cobalt beam redefines lighthouse purpose with felt cost (sailor’s redirected journey, Elara’s spiritual purification); Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt lens functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (vial disrupts mechanism) and charges closure; minor genericism in "heat wave" description prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (garden scent → cobalt beam) under Accumulative lens; sailor’s transformation shows visible cost, but agency leans slightly passive via accident.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action (beacon’s shift from warning to welcome), avoiding moralizing; final scent/image reweights "whispers" without stating moral, fulfilling Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sensory focus on scent/glass) with rhythmic control; "screaming tenderness" risks abstraction but earns resonance through context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clean propulsion ("dawn wind whipping strands"); single borderline metaphor ("screaming tenderness") avoids muddle via payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via "vibrations of intent" physics-mysticism blend; specificity of cobalt light/scent mechanics creates fresh synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
