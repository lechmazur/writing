<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Queen's motivation crystallizes through embodied disenchantment ("hollow echo of a prophecy she felt in her bones"), but lacks layered contradictory impulses beyond duty vs. compulsion. Final renunciation of royal identity for guardianship earns visible cost, though internal conflict remains slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the firefly mending reconfigures cosmic stakes with undeniable cost ("weight of her crown finally replaced by purpose of her blood"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors (queen/cliff/grotto) clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's luminescent stone actively constrains tactics (only accessible at night, light alters perception) and charges closure as the mending site. Fireflies function as micro-setting that stitches the wound—environment indispensable to both conflict and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending cosmic wound) tightens through Accumulative pressure: the climb's physical cost and spirit's revelation narrow options to one ritual act. Agency in queen's choice to raise hands earns cost, though early urgency could feel more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete reconfiguration: "lacy menace" becomes "lace of renewal" via firefly stitching. Final image reweights guardianship without moralizing—"Keeper of the Grotto" crystallizes earned wisdom through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lacy menace weaving through her sleep") modulates under pressure; syntax shortens during climb ("stone cold and sharp beneath her hands"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's crystalline simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but mild density in opening ("a lacy menace weaving through her sleep") risks thematic echo. Propulsion stays clean—"river of fireflies swirled" crystallizes action—though "bleeding starlight" repetition borders on template cadence in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via specific, grounded choices: shared exhale ritual and firefly mending feel inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth in disenchantment avoids abstraction; risk-taking (cosmic stakes resolved through intimate breath) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
