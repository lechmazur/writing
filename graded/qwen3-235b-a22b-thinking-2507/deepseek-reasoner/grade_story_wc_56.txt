<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "serene upheaval" shows simultaneous calm/restructuring; embodied emotion via "fingers brushed smooth metallic" and "breath catching"; micro-choices in salvage technique reveal values. Slight underdevelopment of contradictory impulses pre-revelation holds score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "calm restructuring of her entire understanding" reconfigures the town's lie into sorrow with felt stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (silt→sundial→notes) culminating in legible cost at "painful, beautiful truth visible only from the far side."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twilight canal constrains choice (grappling in settling dark) and charges final image ("black mirror holding starlight"). Micro-setting mastery: the sundial's physicality ("heavy, solid weight of time") directly enables the thematic payoff. No generic placeholder details; every sensory cue (bruised purple water, electric hum) filters through Elara's seeker bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. comforting lies) tightens through the salvage sequence into irreversible knowledge shift. Agency drives escalation: her "feeling in her bones" leads to deliberate grapple work, culminating in the cost of "melancholy reality" that forecloses the legend's simplicity. Pressure grows via Accumulative/Textural density without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "architecture of lies" built on "profound sorrow" reweights the sundial from relic to key. Final image ("sitting in the dark, serene and rearranged") offers non-literal answer to central question—truth salvaged, not proven false—without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from the clockmaker's notes, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "water was a sheet of bruised purple" and "silence of morning radio"; rhythm modulates from contemplative ("quiet pilgrimage") to urgent ("instincts flared"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, with syntactic compression in discovery beats ("smooth and metallic... gnomon still straight and true") avoiding ventriloquism or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval" compresses complex emotion without cliché. Final line ("sitting in the dark, serene and rearranged") delivers propulsion through specificity. No figurative muddle: "bruised purple," "moss-eaten wall," and "pinpricks of starlight" earn their weight. Closure beat radiates clarity with "no further ornamentation."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "mad inventor" trope via specific emotional calculus (grief over time-mapping). Fresh synthesis: "architecture of lies" as foundation for profound sorrow feels inevitable. Avoids safety middle through unflinching "painful, beautiful truth." Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through resonant image rather than action, but slight familiarity in seeker archetype caps score.</comment>
