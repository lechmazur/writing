<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s calm delivery of paradoxes while fingers fly to the clasp; micro-choices like translating fears into dream riddles reveal hierarchy of values under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fear dissolving into boredom), but dream-dictionary mechanism lacks early causal setup; orientation anchors within 120 words via "cold gritty floor" and ozone taste.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funhouse actively pressures choices: mirrors fracture identity during confrontation, cold air signals entity proximity; clasp functions as micro-setting constraining tactics and charging the final glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (surviving fear-entity) tightens through Elara’s paradoxical confessions narrowing options; cost legible in entity’s dissipation, though "photographically cursed" trait remains explanatory rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "fear’s weakness is boredom" reweights premise without moralizing; final image of flickering light charges prior dread with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("taste of ozone," "whisper that was not a sound"); rhythm modulates under pressure with intentional sentence fragmentation during entity confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "whisper slithered... whisper came again" dulls immediacy; otherwise vivid propulsion through concrete verbs ("gasped," "shuddered") avoids figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms horror tropes via dream-dictionary paradoxes; "boredom as fear’s weakness" synthesizes psychology and folklore into fresh, inevitable payoff rooted in established stakes.</comment>
