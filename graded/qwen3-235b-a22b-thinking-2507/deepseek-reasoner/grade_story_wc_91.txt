<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "vibrating emptiness" edges toward stock phrasing. Final realization earned, yet micro-choices feel atmospheric rather than character-driven under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "no longer destitute, but infinitely rich" crystallizes cost of material poverty for spiritual wealth. Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through sensory buildup to the fireflies' release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Black sand functions as micro-setting—constrains choice via "whispering grit" and charges closure when glowing gold under her shadow. Volcanic steam illuminated by fireflies makes environment inseparable from transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when fireflies reactivate in mineral air, forcing Elara’s realization. Passive agency fits Accumulative lens, but cost (her destitution as "necessary emptiness") lacks visceral dramatization in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bottled light vs. volcanic rebirth. Final image reweights "texture of transformation" without moralizing—epiphany earned via sand’s roughness and fireflies’ luminosity, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet sky," "mineral-rich air") modulates rhythm with pressure. Compression taught early via "vibrant hush" motif; no POV leakage despite atmospheric orchestration of her choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fine black grit whispered under worn shoes" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line risks simplicity but works within Earned Stasis—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms philanthropy trope through "accidental prophecy" lens. Black sand’s physicality grounds abstraction; risk-taking in passive protagonist heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
