<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "higher fidelity" rebellion against duty; embodied panic avoidance shows sentinel discipline. Scribe interaction lacks depth but micro-choices (quill holder repurposing) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Final renunciation of blind loyalty earns cost through visible system fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: blackout → improvised investigation → conduit discovery → printing truth → reboot. Closure lands as Charged Poise with "cradle of sparks" crystallizing systemic cost. Engineers' reboot slightly convenient but cost remains undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (light focus/circuit completion) and charges closure (empty holder now holding truth). Sun-stones and conduit system learned through action, not exposition. Environment actively shapes tactics from blackout to resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. power hoarding) tightens immediately via blackout. Kael's agency drives escalation: diverting energy to presses—not full restoration—shows moral calculus. Cost is legible in "cradle of sparks": system remains broken but hope persists, altering future tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cradle of sparks" reconfiguration—no moralizing. Final image answers "can change happen?" non-literally: revolution is partial (single ember), not victory. Avoids thematic echo; scribe's "winking hush" implies shared understanding, not stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("twilight deepening," sentinel pragmatism). Rhythm accelerates during blackout ("pulse stuttered and ceased"). Minor register drift: "calmly inventive" is label-speak where embodiment would deepen tension. Compression under pressure serves narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; "cradle of sparks" avoids muddle. Template cadence in investigation sequence ("He moved... He angled...") but variation follows. "Pathetic flicker" slightly overwrites, yet density supports propulsion. Final line recharges quill holder motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms sentinel trope via specific logic: quill as tool/weapon, sabotage through light-conduits. "Cradle of sparks" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Avoids middle-ground hedging—Kael’s revolution is partial, realistic. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
