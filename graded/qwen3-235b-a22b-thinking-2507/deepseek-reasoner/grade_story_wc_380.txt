<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s embodied motivation ("aching need" rooted in whale event) and micro-choices (reverent chipping) reveal contradictory impulses; "terrible, beautiful knowing" slightly abstracts final cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes: "keeper of darkness" with gravity’s weight as felt cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern escalation (coffee lattice → crystal chamber → dissolving memory).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt crystals constrain choice (navigating gravity pockets) and charge the final image ("pockets heavy with knowing"); "dandelion seed" float evokes profession-specific sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through gravity’s physical cost during exhumation (flung against wall), but whale’s beaching as "symptom" slightly overextends causality without prior memory-weight groundwork.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt-crystal archive’s "emotional weight," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "gleaming silence" as sacred burden without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("hands like worn rope," coffee sediment patterns); tense/stability flawless, though "felt their memories humming" slightly overreaches embodied cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "smooth stones in a pocket" metaphor integrates with closure, but "terrible, beautiful knowing" edges toward abstraction in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memory/gravity synthesis feels inevitable; "quarantined" reframing avoids cliché, with whale’s beaching as ancestral memory rupture elevating emotional truth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
