<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (transient vs absolute connection) drives rescue choice; embodied emotion in "cold nimble fingers" avoids label-speak; flaw (impermanence) compounds into unrecorded intervention cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "a story told in objects... quietly absorbed" reconfigures "honoring histories" with conceptual cost of unrecorded intervention; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density tightening stakes after rock crack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silk thread (tool) constrains rescue method—prevents wing tear—and charges final image as "tiny, temporary knot"; grotto's thicket directly traps butterfly, altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: rock crack forces shift from observation to precise silk-thread intervention; cost legible in "intervention that would never be recorded" as history continues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of the knot reweights "honoring histories" into ephemeral acts without moralizing; theme emerges through moth wing/monarch duality and unrecorded rescue, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blushing stillness," "fleck of brilliant orange"); rhythm modulates from lyrical cadence to staccato crisis ("Without thought, Elara moved") then calm precision during rescue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "minute adjustment in a world of immense scale" achieves high density without muddle; final line crystallizes theme through concrete image ("transient root in eternal grotto").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conservation theme through unrecorded intervention; "transient root" concept transforms "honoring histories" via specific, irreplaceable silk-knot action.</comment>
