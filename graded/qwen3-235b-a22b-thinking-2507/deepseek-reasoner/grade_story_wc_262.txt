<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction in "frantic drum" vs. "unused love" reveals projectionist's struggle. Final choice to deliver film earned through vision's emotional cost, though micro-choices lack specificity during incubation phase.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with tear's visible cost under Accumulative lens. "Unused love had been waiting" risks thematic echo but is redeemed by physicality of the tear. Orientation clear by word 30, but lens ambiguity in midpoint vision shift slightly dilutes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting: platen heat incubates film, sprocket holes enable reading, dust embodies time. Final image charges closure through "dim light" catching tear on velvet-rope hands. Recurring film strip constrains every choice from incubation to delivery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (50-year love delivery) tighten through protagonist's agency: incubation enables vision, vision dictates delivery. Cost is palpable in the tear and "long silence broken." Minor escalation flaw: vision shift lacks pressure beyond melody cue, slightly softening the Accumulative deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: splicing film as "visual poem," love stored in creation not place. Final image reweights "unused love" as active waiting without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via usher's tear rather than dialogue, though "found its way home" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hushed thunder of past audiences," "latent energies trapped in celluloid." Rhythmic control peaks in vision sequence with compressed syntax. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during psychometry. Minor register drift in "incubate latent energies."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle film strip, its images faded to ghosts" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line's cadence ("long silence was finally broken") charges closure. Slight overwriting in "collective breath held in suspense" creates minor density issue in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "love letter" trope through film splicing as spatial solution. Emotional truth in projectionist's ink-stained fingers and usher's brass-fitting smile. Risk-taking (psychometry as plot device) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure's tear feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
