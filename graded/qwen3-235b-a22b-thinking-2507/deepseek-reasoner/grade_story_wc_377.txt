<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory action (chipping ice, pushing rings); embodied emotion avoids labels. Minimal internal contradiction beyond muteness/wonder tension slightly limits depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (enduring muteness as peace); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through seven-day melting. Orientation clear by para 2; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture functions as micro-setting constraining choices (maintaining motion) and charging final image. "Cloud floor" description slightly generic but prismatic light shards provide irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (fading wonder); escalation via protagonist’s agency in slow melting process. Cost (seasonal muteness as blessing) deepens final image but could resonate more during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (sculpture→symphony); final image answers "can wonder be restored?" non-literally. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in "truth" lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (resonance/light focus); rhythmic control mirrors grinding motion. Minor register drift in "profound truth" phrasing but compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-loop in "impossibly cold and impossibly clear" deducts slightly. Otherwise high density: "prismatic shards of light" charges closure. Zero scaffold in peak melting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "symphony of truth" as physical resonance transforms abstract concepts. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
