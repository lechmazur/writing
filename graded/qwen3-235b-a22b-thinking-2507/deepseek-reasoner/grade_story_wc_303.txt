<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied "mulberry ache" and plant-telepathy flaw drive her choice, but quiet-dream motivation lacks contradictory impulse depth; final renunciation earns cost via coffee-stain vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the propagating note crystallizes stakes with felt cost (sacrificed dream), holding Accumulative lens through sensory density shift in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coffee cup as micro-setting constrains choice (stain reading) and charges final image; velvet observatory's trembling plants integrate with action, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "perforated destiny" deepening (vision holes), but empire's weight lacks visceral escalation; cost (dream forfeited) is legible yet abstract in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "mulberry ache" transforming to "impossible hope" answers art-vs-power question without moralizing; perforated destiny reweights via propagating note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chlorophyll screams," "mulberry ache") modulates under pressure; no POV drift despite vision shift; rhythmic control elevates closure's soul-deep note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cracks like lightning" metaphor avoids muddle; slight overwriting ("silent, slow screams") in early beat prevents 9.5+, but closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of provenance research with coffee-stain futurism; plant telepathy transforms trope into organic constraint; risk-taking (no bow needed) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
