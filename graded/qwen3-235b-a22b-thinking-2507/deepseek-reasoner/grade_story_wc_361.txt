<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (disappointment vs duty) intensifies through embodied choices; final renunciation of courier identity earned by pendant contact. Slight over-reliance on "jittery" without deeper physiological specificity in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visible cost ("no longer felt jittery... became its first keeper"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aurora density shifts to memory germination reweighting the "routine." No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway actively constrains choices (permafrost vs impossible growth) and charges final image. "Frost-heaved stone" and pendant’s light direct action; sensory hierarchy reflects courier’s professional urgency. Environment essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Kaelen’s lesson) tightens through protagonist’s agency (touching pendant), narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is legible in identity shift ("courier became keeper"). Pressure grows via resonant frequency’s escalating effects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "coax wonder" transforms from empty phrase to germinating garden. Final image ("garden of moments") reweights memory without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "Make it grow" lip-read.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost-heaved stone," "jittery relic courier’s anxiety") with rhythmic compression under stress ("Hours seemed to pass"). No head-hopping; POV consistency anchors emotional progression. Slight register drift in "view across the fade."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fracturing it into a thousand tiny rainbows"). Final line’s "living truth" avoids abstraction. Minor tell in "profound disappointment settled" dilutes embodiment, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: courier as memory-tender avoids trope through resonant physics and permafrost constraints. Transformation test passed—generic "magic stone" would break closure. Risk-taking (quiet ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
