<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("logical dreamer") and embodied emotion ("serene upheaval") are strong, but "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats (e.g., "logical dreamer" as trait rather than demonstrated behavior) triggers −0.4 penalty; final choice lacks visceral physical cost despite conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (world's "fading palette" infused with light), but cost isn't visually legible per proof test—no exact image showing the "fraying" fabric's cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds yet isn't clearly taught early, risking ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (altitude gauge measuring "density of potential") constrains choices and charges final image; grotto's mother-of-pearl walls evolve causally by reflecting diagrams. However, tide-polished setting remains static post-establishment, missing full "constraint" gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (releasing balloons, drawing patterns) under Accumulative lens, but water drip coincidence nearly resolves conflict; cost is conceptual (world's emotional thinning) yet lacks visceral felt price in closure beat, failing 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (equations as hope's resonance), with final image reweighting "puzzle out new equations" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo but "serene upheaval" borders on abstract phrasing, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("acoustics of reality," "bell-like pool") and rhythmic control under pressure; poetic compression taught early. Minor register drift in "density of potential" slightly jars with lucid dreamer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops, but "serene upheaval" abstracts emotion in peak beat; strategic telling ("She had been sending out trial balloons") compresses transit without scaffold. Final image ("warm and solid wave") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math and hope via "altitude of what-could-be"; specific details (powdered iridescent shell) avoid generality. Emotional truth strong, but "serene upheaval" lacks transformative risk for 9.0 band.</comment>
