<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not lonely, but full of conversation needing no words," with embodied emotion through wood grain and callus memories. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices like ignoring the finished carving reveal hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "crystallized time" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carving’s transformation into "a foundation instead of a wound" reconfigures grief with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—rain/kettle density shifts reweight the stake. Cost proof crystallizes in "hollow space... become foundation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ash wood and rain-beaded skylight constrain choices: carving shapes the final image while steam meeting rain charges closure. Micro-setting functions as environment—kettle’s whistle forces present-moment reintegration. Rust patina motif evolves from description to earned thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: each gouge cut narrows options by containing grief fragments until kettle whistle demands reintegration. Dominant stake (containing uncontainable) deepens texturally with felt cost—"hollow space become foundation." Slight passivity in reflection blocks 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rust-hued peace" (patina metaphor) and carving’s evolution, avoiding moralizing. Final line—"Here, and gone, and always here"—resonates as non-literal answer to loss. No thematic echo; "harvest" motif earns wisdom through tea leaves swirling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wood/steam/rain textures with rhythmic control ("steady hiss" to "rising urgency"). Voice modulates under pressure—carving focus vs. tea ritual. Slight repetition of "rust-hued peace" prevents 9.0 despite purposeful cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ton of muscle and tooth" replaces cliché with textural specificity. Propulsion through active verbs ("gouge bit," "steam rose"). Final line’s rhythm ("Here, and gone, and always here") delivers closure without figurative muddle. No overwriting in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms widow trope via "containing memory as lesson" angle. Emotional truth in "love transmutes" avoids sentimentality; ash wood’s specific properties matter. Risk-taking in quiet closure with conceptual repricing, though "crystallized time" borders on familiar phrasing.</comment>
