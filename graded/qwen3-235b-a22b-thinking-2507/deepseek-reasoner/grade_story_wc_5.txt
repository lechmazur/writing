<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation for preserving heartbeats is clear and embodied through ritual actions, but lacks contradictory impulses during the climax—Elara's unwavering focus misses the required internal tension. The fossilized apple placement shows character-specific choice, yet no visible struggle between urgency and precision undermines the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the sublimated map's pulse reconfigures the orchard's dormant life into tangible promise with undeniable conceptual cost ("items were gone, sublimated"). The accumulative/textural lens holds through the humming heartbeat synchronization, with the aurora's fade crystallizing the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The copper plate and safekept starlight function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image—the plate's etched lines guide the ritual, while the starlight's mercury-like flow dictates the map's creation. The subarctic cold shapes every action (e.g., "crackle of ice-laden soil" limiting movement), meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through environmental pressure (cold, fading aurora), but the dominant conflict lacks a felt cost during the sealing act. The "moving stillness" deepens tension, yet Elara's physical endurance faces no active consequence—frost on the vial or trembling hands would have made the cost unmistakable per Q4's quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the map's transformation: "charting potential life" reweights preservation as active hope without moralizing. The final pulse offers a resonant answer to "translating heartbeats," avoiding abstraction. But the "promise of spring" edges toward sentimentality, missing the 9+ nuance of earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "world of swift, precise conflagrations" versus "moving stillness," with rhythmic control in the sealing sequence ("no explosion, only a silent, blinding flash"). Compression of time ("stood for an hour") is taught early and pays off in the climax's breathless momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops and maintains propulsion, but near-synonyms dilute impact: "swift, precise conflagrations" echoes "world of swift, precise conflagrations" in adjacent sentences. Figurative language remains clear in peak beats (starlight as "liquid mercury"), though "frozen green of the aurora" slightly drifts from Elara's alchemist lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes alchemy with ecological preservation through specific, grounded details (obsidian glass shards as leaves). The flash-paper twist—using it for sealing, not fire—feels inevitable. Avoids derivative tropes via the orchard's "spectral anatomy," though the "promise of spring" finale lacks a fresh emotional inflection for 9.0.</comment>
