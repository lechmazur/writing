<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism intensifies credibly under pressure; "hope a brambled thing" embodies contradictory impulses. Kael’s engineering-driven choices reveal values, but limited interiority for secondary character caps score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "began to dissipate" crystallizes Elara’s dissolution cost. Causal lens holds tightly—"because/therefore" linkage from chalk to nebula sustains escalation without coincidence resolving stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bell’s irrigation mechanics directly constrain Kael’s choices, charging the final image ("You are the garden"). Orchards and quartz arches aren’t postcards—they enable the nebula’s mineral reaction, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: messages → repairs → bell ringing → insufficient water → sacrifice. Elara’s agency drives each escalation; dissolution cost is visceral in "poured the last of her spirit," fulfilling 9+ quick test under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"You are the garden" reweights the premise non-literally, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through chalk-to-family arc without abstraction—Kael’s realization charges closure with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ghostly POV signature ("shimmering with a need," "brambled hope") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in "tangled with fear but stubbornly growing" avoids ventriloquism; no head-hopping despite dual focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "violet and silver" nebula image does triple duty (atmosphere/theme/closure). High density in "clapper silent for decades" conveys history without telling—peak beats avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transcends ghost trope via chalk/bell mechanics: altruism becomes actionable through mineral physics. Emotional specificity ("strangers no longer, but a family") avoids generic templates, meeting 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
