<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority shines via concrete details (freight manifests vs. symphony echo), but Henry remains underdeveloped as on-page character; final choice lacks contradictory impulses in scene despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise under stars succeeds, but cost proof fails—no exact line where loss of Mrs. Gable’s intended connection becomes legible; typhoon chaos feels like convenient amnesia violating BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: locket photo constrains choices (tucking it in envelope) and charges final image (framed on table); breezy library pages mirror emotional flutter, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via meaningful deepening (letter return → photo discovery), but coincidence drives escalation (photo fall), not pure protagonist agency under accumulative lens; cost is felt but not visibly paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through photo exchange and "cycle" resonance; final line "received far more" offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though symphony’s "unsung heroes" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cargo broker noticing manifests vs. library breezes), but "cautious exuberance" is label-only; register drift in "resonant note" phrasing slightly jars occupational voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflection ("felt whimsically attentive... possibility she couldn’t name") and template cadence ("She hurried... wrote... sealed"); strong verbs offset loops, but density lags in backstory fragment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "mismatched address" trope via cargo broker specificity and photo-as-micro-setting; emotional truth in quiet connection outweighs symphony donor familiarity, though risk-taking stays within safe bounds.</comment>
