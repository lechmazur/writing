<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fractured mirror" precognition showing simultaneous hope/despair; micro-choice of reaching "with entirety of being" reveals value hierarchy shift. Epiphany slightly over-articulated but redeemed by embodied cost of world's "shudder" and dissolving dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: curse transforms into resolve as friction's "faint, almost nothing" resistance shudders through world. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds via stone sequences to eels' arrival, reconfiguring meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora isn't backdrop but functional micro-setting: its light "drunk" by painted stones enables the focal point, then "pulses softly" as earned light post-friction. Tidal bluff's peat constrains the ritual, charging the final image where dust dissolves "into the very bluffs."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore friction) tightens through Kaelen's agency: stone arrangement → eels' response → void manifestation. Cost crystallizes in the "shudder" and "tremor" of resistance—a felt physical price that reconfigures the world's state under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of balance over control emerges organically: "sacred pattern" reweighted when eels shift from "charges" to "guides," culminating in non-literal answer—"to become part of the pattern"—as dust dissolves. Zero moralizing; cost is the world's shudder, not Kaelen's feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices mathematical sequences and auroral light first, not emotions. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks with compressed syntax ("He understood now") during epiphany, while "borrowed dawn" lexicon stays consistent through transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silent, sliding things" establishes texture early. Every line multi-tasks: "fractured mirror" describes both curse and insight. Final line ("feeling the first real dawn...") crystallizes closure without abstraction—pure image propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms frictionless trope through specific physics ("resistance... faint, almost nothing") and eel herding. Risk-taking heightens stakes: lyrical math sequences feel inevitable, not gimmicky. "Borrowed dawn" specificity anchors universality without abstraction.</comment>
