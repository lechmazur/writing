<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("technically gentle" hands vs calloused history) drive micro-choices during rope reweaving; final kneeling in awe earns endurance with visible cost ("whispered names swirled like a warm breeze"). Backstory fragment on self-forgiveness anchors present stance without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the singing bronze forces irreversible stance crystallization ("forgotten were forgotten no more"), with emotional price legible in her physical collapse ("sank to her knees... tears"). Accumulative lens holds—rope reconfiguration tightens options through protagonist agency, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum constrains choice (furnace heat vs glacial air) and charges final image through light contrast (aurora vs bronze's "golden pulse"). Rope functions as micro-setting: its braids directly alter tactics during reweaving, avoiding white-room syndrome via tactile details ("dust of ages," "sweet-scented smoke").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: unpicking rope braids integrates melody into history, narrowing options to this singular method. Cost is unmistakable in the physical/emotional toll ("knees," "tears") and the sanctum’s transformation—pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "transcribed memory" becomes literal bronze song, reweighting "forgotten names" via the final chorus. No moralizing—resonance stems from the lark’s metallic tone weaving with whispered voices, offering non-literal answer to memory’s fragility without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("technically gentle" as embodied craft lexicon) modulates under pressure; rhythm shifts from meditative ("movements slow, reverent") to urgent ("poured the glowing bronze"). Minor register drift in "transcribed memory" slightly jars artisan POV, but no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "river of liquid sun" avoids purple prose through context, zero loops. One slight muddle ("silent, shifting symphony of green/violet" risks aurora cliché), but final image clarity ("light pulsed, rhythmic, like a heartbeat") remains uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lost-wax casting transforms into memory preservation via rope/card integration. Emotional specificity in "hundreds of names... young, old voices" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (craft as resurrection ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure image feels inevitable.</comment>
