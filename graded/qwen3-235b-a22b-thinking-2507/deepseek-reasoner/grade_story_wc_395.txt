<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's obsession with "where deleted files go" drives credible micro-choices under pressure; final upload choice earns closure through prior causality. Lyra's underdeveloped grief void slightly weakens secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "the weight of the embroidered patch" crystallizes her career sacrifice. Causal lens holds perfectly through upload climax; "sensed absence" motif charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Server "cavern" and patch function as micro-setting that constrains choices (lock combo) and charges closure. Final image's tactile patch weight reweights the archive's silence with concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalation driven by Elara's agency (decoding numbers → warehouse hunt) tightens options meaningfully. Minor flaw: coordinates discovery lacks sufficient causal setup, slightly softening the pressure turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sensed absence" resolves into archive's "truly complete" silence without moralizing. Final image reweights deletion as resurrection, answering "where deleted files go" through charged physicality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mausoleum of status updates," "roar that echoed through halls") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control intensifies during forensic work; no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("she uploaded... like a supernova"). Figurative language ("whispers of billion users") serves character-specific observation without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms corporate conspiracy trope through digital archaeology lens. "Sensed absence" premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
