<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "staying while leaving" choice; embodied empathy avoids labels. Minor abstraction in "profoundly altered" slightly weakens physical cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: sensory density builds toward Earned Stasis. Midnight chime crystallizes cost in "solitude no longer retreat." Closure image reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Recurring invitation/book constrains choices and charges final image ("thin volume... not been there"). Sensory details filtered through empathy ("scent of vellum") actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: "hiding" transforms from physical to existential. Midnight pressure narrows options; cost legible in redefined solitude. Single tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final book of "small errors" delivers non-literal answer to "unearth wisdom" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (library's humility), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empathy extending to whispers of place") modulates rhythm under pressure. "Cognitive frost" slightly abstract but compensated by concrete "sigh of settling page."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "listening silence" exemplifies layered density. Minor abstraction in "profoundly altered" slightly dulls physical cost, but final line recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" transforms recluse trope through specific emotional calculus. Solitude redefined as active wisdom-seeking avoids derivative safety, with risk-taking enhancing coherence.</comment>
