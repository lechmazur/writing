<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (avoidance ritual vs. desperate pull), but the feather-triggered memory flood lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in the climax beat, missing the 9.0+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("memory no longer a wound, but a compass"), though the stone's sudden decipherability via feather feels slightly convenient, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (feather texture) constrains the pivotal choice and charges the final image ("first tool of her reclaimed craft"), meeting the 9+ gate despite the mountain-bookstore's near-static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens—stone resists substitution, feather texture deepens knowledge—with visceral cost legible in "pain of remembering was the pain of awakening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "preservation as home" reweighted by the final gardening metaphor, avoiding moralizing; the "compass" image offers resonant, non-literal closure to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("swirling mercury-glass" eyes filter all description) and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "resonant hum" slightly strains the seer's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("self-woven fiction, a blanket of calm" compresses method/emotion), but "hidden thunder" repetition (3x with slight variation) creates a micro-loop in the pressure beat, blocking 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia tropes through tactile language mechanics; risk-taking (memory as physical sensation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the feather's timing edges toward convenience.</comment>
