<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation ("free an idea") lacks embodied contradiction; client's "improbable longing" remains abstract despite vivid token. Final choice (releasing ribbon) feels earned but emotional cost is underweighted in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with ribbon's placement implying conceptual cost ("balance restored"), but emotional aftermath ("calm certainty") slightly undercuts the liberation's weight. Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds through cosmic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lock of hair functions as micro-setting that charges closure (ribbon in drawer) and constrains journey. Sensory details ("colors running like wet ink") are purposeful, though "shadowed nexus" lacks tactical pressure beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing idea) tightens via fear-wall dissolution, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—locksmith's "conversation" with fear resolves too smoothly without narrowing options or visible cost during the act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hair/ribbon mechanics (enveloped secrets as physical binding), avoiding moralizing. Final image (ribbon in drawer) offers resonant answer to "imprisoned truth," though "liberated thought" risks thematic echo without deeper personal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("phantom heart," "breeze it once danced in") and rhythmic control shine. No POV slippage, though client's dialogue lacks idiom differentiation; "improbable longing" phrase borders on thematic label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; "symphony, theory, poem, revolution" achieves high density. Minor paraphrase loop ("world twisted... disorientation faded") prevents 8.8+, but propulsion remains impeccable through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "locksmith" trope through metaphysical mechanics; hair-as-lock feels fresh. Risk-taking (cosmic journey as internal process) heightens stakes, but "frightened concept" leans slightly toward abstraction without deeper human specificity.</comment>
