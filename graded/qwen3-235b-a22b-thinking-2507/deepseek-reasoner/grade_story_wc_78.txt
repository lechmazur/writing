<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Kai's flawless execution under pressure removes struggle. Motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is clear but interiority shows no conflicting desires during the storm's peak, missing the 9+ gate's requirement for contradictory impulses driving the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: storm's unraveling shows conceptual cost ("chaos had been given order"), and Kai's thrumming exhaustion + luminous lemon pluck reconfigure the premise. Accumulative lens holds throughout with density shifts from silence to "restless euphony" tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet's "etchings that seemed to move" constrains Kai's action (tracing resonance) and charges the final image (plucking the lemon as "instrument"). Driftwood ring's hum directly alters storm physics, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kai's agency: tracing fractal patterns transforms wind into "deep, melodic tone," then waves into "crashing chord." Cost is unmistakable in "body thrumming with spent energy" and the storm's conceptual pacification, though one tightening (density increase) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final lemon pluck offers resonant, non-literal answer to "can chaos be transformed?" by reweighting the core concept: the fruit as "instrument" that "played beautifully" embodies earned wisdom without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds coiled into a familiar, terrifying pattern—a spiraling void") shows Kai's specialized cognition. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from lyrical ("sea and sky bled into one amorphous indigo") to staccato ("He did not fight. He conducted.") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("amorphous indigo... bruised, fractious clouds... spiraling void") risks density overload, but high-pressure beats avoid figurative muddle. Final image ("luminous lemon") delivers crystalline propulsion with zero loops, though not quite 9.0 due to slight cadence stiffness in setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes "tide prophet" trope through specific "sketched resonance" mechanics, avoiding derivative safety. Emotional truth in transforming violence into harmony feels fresh, but risk distinction (+0.2) eludes due to Kai's effortless mastery lacking tangible struggle.</comment>
