<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in wilting trait and "lie" contract, but deeper layers of fear (beyond professional guilt) remain underexplored. Final choice earned via micro-choices like nudging floorboard, though emotional progression leans slightly tidy during map assembly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "Listen" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (silence vs. truth-seeking), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by word 50 ("glass-latticed jewel under dome"), and causal pressure tightens via protagonist agency in map assembly and Aviary venture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice: zinc fragment fits machine slot, while decaying Aviary's "skeletal remains" charge the final image. Sensory specificity ("metallic taste" of tension, "dripping lower levels") filters through calligrapher's tactile expertise, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. deception) tightens through protagonist agency: wilting forces contract abandonment, candor requirement drives admission. Conceptual cost legible in "afraid my work added to silence" reweighting her identity, though secondary pressure (sector desperation) lacks direct on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "candor as currency" reframes marriage contract lies into "Listen" resolution without moralizing. Final image reweights "lost conversations" motif into active listening, avoiding thematic echo despite high conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "ochre sky," "gilded veins dulling" reflect calligrapher's tactile world. Rhythmic control peaks in Aviary sequence ("wires glowing amber light"), compressing stress without voice drift. Zero head-hopping despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "sickening wilt begin in fingertips" shows embodied emotion. Final line "Listen" achieves maximum density. Minor deduction for "method was clear" tell-y phrasing in map assembly beat, but peak action remains visceral.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes: "wilts near dishonesty" transforms truth-teller cliché through physiological specificity. Zinc fragment's role as both map legend and machine key demonstrates organic integration, though "lost conversations" motivation borders on familiar.</comment>
