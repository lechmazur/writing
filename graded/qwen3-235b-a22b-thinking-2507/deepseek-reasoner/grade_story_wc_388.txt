<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in climax choice (destroy beauty vs truth), but embodied emotion during digging lacks specific physicality beyond "hands scraped." Final renunciation of comforting illusion earns visible cost through the dead orchard's description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: "ochre dust settled on a dead orchard" crystallizes the bleak truth Kaelen chose. Causal chain holds perfectly from diamond discovery to nexus destruction under consistent Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (illusion vs reality) and charges the final image. "Vitrified soil" and diamond's physical properties directly enable the climax action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: diamond revelation tightens options to "leave or act," with the digging climax foreclosing the comforting lie path. Cost is unmistakable in the brittle trees and pocketed diamond's final weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("comfortable lies," decaying Stillpoint), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "beauty" as "ruins of a beautiful dream" without stating a moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sepia-toned nightmare," "ochre haze") filters all description through Kaelen's debunker lens. Rhythmic compression during the digging sequence ("hands scraped... hum ceased") heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vitrified soil" and "flickering lantern" achieve triple duty. Minor mixed metaphor in "flickering violently like a bad transmission" slightly dulls the climax image but doesn't obscure closure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "stasis field as comforting lie" transforms post-apocalyptic tropes. Bold risk in destroying the beauty he sought avoids sentimental hope, with emotional specificity rooted in Kaelen's methodology.</comment>
