<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation for capturing aging's sound is concrete and flawlessly embodied ("tear through grime," "pocketing chalk"). Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at climax—Silas acts with single-minded focus rather than layered conflict, missing 9+ gate by hairline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "longing receded, then swelled" crystallizes eternal cycle with undeniable cost. Orientation anchored by "fog sculpture garden" at 98 words. Minor scope slip: "many days after" slightly blurs single-scene window but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog garden actively constrains movement ("dense fog twisting shapes") and enables sound resonance on bus hull. Rust/ivy textures charge final image as time's physical manifestation. "Flowering ivy" slightly ornamental but redeemed by closure's dissolving fog metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake tightening through Silas' agency (markers → circle → listening) reweights dominant conflict beautifully. Cost is visceral (forgetting sound, enduring longing), but lacks visible loss altering tactics—e.g., no broken chalk or lost markers to heighten 9+ escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final line ("capturing... by forever listening") reweights premise as non-literal answer to time's elusiveness. Zero moralizing; theme emerges from "hair turning white" texture. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity—aging's beauty/sadness inseparable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "crystalline clarity dissolving into mist" mirrors precognition. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("frantically... scrambled"). Slight abstraction in "profound déjà vu" prevented 9.1, but voice remains cohesive through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snap bleached branches" shows not tells. Minor synonym churn: "deep and tidal longing" echoes "profound... déjà vu" (both "deep/profound" + abstract noun). Enough to block 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope via junkyard mechanics (chalk/driftwood). Sound-of-aging premise avoids sentimentality through concrete textures ("spine bending," "joint pop"). "Junkyard prophet" edges near noir cliché but redeemed by specificity.</comment>
