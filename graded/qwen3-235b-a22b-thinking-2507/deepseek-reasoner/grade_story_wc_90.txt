<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stitch not fight" philosophy made literal, but Kwan Yin's tear appears without prior causal groundwork for the climax, slightly undercutting the earnedness of the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the doorway's emergence, but the cost of "oppressive weight vanished" feels insufficiently weighted against the scale of "accumulated sorrow of generations," slightly thinning the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recycled ship functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (thin air in old sector, groaning deck plates) and charges the final image—jade droplet on stitched photo literally reconfigures the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density of sorrow (Accumulative lens), but the resolution lacks visible trade-offs; the Kwan Yin solution resolves trauma without prior struggle or tangible cost to Elara beyond emotional labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "stitching salted grief into a key," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "shadow work" as alchemy without stating theme, though "infinite compassion" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("crystalline residue that had outlasted the eyes that cried them"), rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional shifts, zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is immaculate with high density ("fossilized fact in the databanks"), but "profound, almost physical lightening" risks therapy-speak abstraction in a peak beat, narrowly avoiding Q7 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms pacifism into tangible mechanics (light-stitching), but Kwan Yin's tear relies on familiar spiritual trope; emotional specificity elevates it beyond derivative premise.</comment>
