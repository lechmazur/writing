<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("uncertainly certain") drives action; ash-parched skin embodiment grounds epiphany. Shift from tinkerer to planter earned by compass realization, though micro-choices under pressure lack layered hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("full of uncertainty") under Accumulative lens. Patterns accumulate to reconfigure meaning; cost legible in "for the first time since the ashes fell" anchoring the shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall’s mist directly charges final image ("blessing on ash-parched skin") while constraining choices (ash blindness necessitates compass). Soil jar’s fertility reweights stakes, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating uncertainty) tightens through pattern accumulation; abandoning tools for improvisation forecloses past identity. Cost visible in ash-choked skin and conceptual shift, though escalation lacks physical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass mechanics ("pathways through atmospheric pressure"), not moralizing. Final image reweights "befriending uncertainty" as active hope without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via tinkerer’s precision ("brass pendulum swinging insistently"); ash-filtered sensory hierarchy evolves with urgency. Rhythmic control in waterfall descent ("crunch of settled cinders") modulates tension perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; "frantic dance of leaves" avoids overwriting by charging closure. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" metaphor, but propulsion remains clean through final cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of clockmaker’s precision with uncertainty navigation feels inevitable; compass transforms tropes via air-current mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens coherence without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
