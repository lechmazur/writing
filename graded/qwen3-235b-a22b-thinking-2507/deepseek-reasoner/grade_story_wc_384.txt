<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction ("weight both heavy and light") and embodied choices (blood-ink ritual, steady hands during unlayering) reveal authentic conflict. Near-miss: "forgive the unfinished life" edges toward thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing through concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "the revealed script glowed faintly" crystallizes the conceptual weight of posthumous redemption. Orientation anchors at 35 words ("marble sanctuary below"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the vellum discovery beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sanctuary actively pressures choices: stalactite drip times her patience, marble cold contrasts workshop warmth, and the rose thorn (micro-setting) charges the final image. Environment constrains tactics when she "teased at the edge of the vellum" under dripping silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (uncovering truth vs preserving legacy) deepens through textual analysis; the "hesitation in the capital 'M'" beat narrows options by revealing layered forgery. Cost is legible in "risked everything... died before he could see it through" with visible impact on her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truths are layered" realized via vellum unlayering, not abstraction. Final image ("luminous, forgiving night") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "forgive" from duty to earned understanding through specific action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: forger’s eye notices "pressure of the nib" and "spaces between words." Rhythmic control intensifies during discovery ("A whisper-thin layer began to lift") with purposeful compression. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wicked heritage rose thorn" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line ("luminous, forgiving night") avoids purple prose while charging closure. Minor deduction: "calibrated treason" slightly elevated for POV lexicon but justified as professional term.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms forgery trope through specific emotional calculus (posthumous redemption of stolen birthright). "Forgery atop a forgery" twist feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in quiet closure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
