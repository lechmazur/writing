<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara realizes the trauma caused collective amnesia ("why consciousness had retreated"), but "sensitively perceptive" remains tell-not-show; embodied emotion lacks physicality during high-stakes discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Elara grasps her mission’s weight ("diagnosis for species-wide amnesia"), with felt cost in the tapestry’s "heavy weight." Accumulative lens holds as fragments coalesce into irreversible understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The silo-library’s "bronze quiet" and "soot-blackened fireplace" constrain every choice; the tapestry fragment charging the final image ("help them find their center") satisfies the 9+ gate. Sensory details like "metallic tang of the silo" serve urgency without checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency as diary entries narrow options toward the axis revelation, with visible cost in the "heavy weight" of truth. Dominant stake (recovering lost memory) tightens coherently, though "profound nausea" description lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the tapestry’s tilted wheel reweights "last human dream" into a resonant, non-literal answer about trauma. Avoids moralizing; the final image ("one recovered word at a time") charges prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "emotional residue left on objects" and "neuron in a sleeping brain" metaphors. Rhythmic control under pressure ("fevered yet precise") avoids head-hopping, though "collective psyche had simply... stopped dreaming" edges toward clinical diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle pages crumbled at the edges" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "catatonia of the soul" (therapy-speak) in a high-pressure beat costs 0.3, but propulsion remains clean through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via historian’s lens: "walls have heard" makes memory tangible. Fresh inflection in dragons as gravitational symbols, though "species-wide amnesia" slightly echoes familiar frameworks without sufficient novelty.</comment>
