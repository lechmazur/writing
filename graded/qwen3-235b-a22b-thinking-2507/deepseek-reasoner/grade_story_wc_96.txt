<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in climax; Ezra accepts key without internal struggle despite panic. Motivation clear but molting flaw underutilized in pivotal moment. Silas's quiet pressure effectively forces stance crystallization with embodied cost (tears).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Silas's tear-tracked dust crystallizes their pact with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—textural buildup (rusted shelves, moonlight) culminates in resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchored by 38 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as micro-setting: shelves constrain access, broken skylight guides moonlight, and spectral glow charges final image. Every detail (damp-spotted books, coffee tin's rattle) pressures choices or reweights closure. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Ezra's need to order chaos vs. fear of exposure) tightens via key discovery. Agency-driven escalation: Silas's unspoken invitation forces stance crystallization. Cost is visceral (Ezra's trembling, Silas's tears) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "blooming resistance" materializes as transcribed voices, not stated. Final tears reweight "luminous fracture" into earned hope without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in embracing prison's silenced truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Ezra notices textures (damp-spotted books), Silas speaks in fragments. Stress shortens syntax ("He simply nodded"). Compression taught early pays off; no head-hopping despite dual POV moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rusted library" reappears with shifting meaning. Final line ("fracture had become luminous") crystallizes theme without abstraction. Minor deduction: "blooming resistance" slightly vague amid concrete prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms prison library trope through specific details (napkin sketches, Marcus Aurelius wedge). "Luminous fracture" concept feels fresh. Avoids safety middle by making Ezra's instability essential to rebuilding fragmented voices.</comment>
