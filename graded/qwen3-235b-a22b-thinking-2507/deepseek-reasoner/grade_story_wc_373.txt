<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (loyalty vs. professional detachment) act simultaneously in scene; final choice earned through embodied micro-choices under pressure ("delicate and swift" fingers on fob), avoiding diagnostic labels. Silas's shame crystallizes cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the *click* reweights trust's fragility, made legible by Silas's "weary shame" and Elara's "weight heavier than moonshine." Causal lens holds perfectly through because/therefore progression from failed bump to fob manipulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The antique watch fob functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must capture its sound) and charges the final image ("small devastating sound that held the echo of a broken promise"). Sensory details ("smell of salt, decay") reflect urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: false starts narrow options to the fob solution, with visible cost in Silas's "dawning horror." The tide deadline tightens tactics meaningfully, and the *click* reweights stakes through conceptual cost rather than physical confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fob's physical disintegration as metaphor for trust, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("sound that held the echo of a broken promise") delivers resonant non-literal answer to betrayal's cost without stating a thesis, embracing complexity through Silas's shame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-filtered details ("heart a frantic drum," "jerking across wet boards"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during distraction climax ("She didn’t bump into him. Her fingers...") modulate intensity without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "metallic sigh of betrayal" compresses emotional and plot weight. Final line recharges "comforting unease" with devastating specificity, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "betrayal proof" trope through sound-as-evidence mechanism. Emotional specificity in Silas's reaction ("no anger... weary shame") avoids safety middle, though premise isn't radically new. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
