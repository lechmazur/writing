<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "cautious exuberance" stated but not embodied through micro-choices under peak pressure. Tears feel earned but miss visceral struggle against self-doubt that would heighten cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pressure tightens via sensory escalation (hum → vibration → symphony) with conceptual cost ("silence rendered meaningless"). Orientation debt (dawn revealed late) applies -0.4 but closure's Charged Poise remains potent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Archive setting lacks tactile specificity ("towering shelves" generic); no object constrains choices despite ink well's presence. Cap at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty, though final image (well's glow vs dawn) charges closure weakly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (restore trust before dawn) tightens through glyph-by-glyph deepening; agency clear as she injects energy despite risks. Cost visible in colleagues' dismissal, though internal conflict with recklessness remains underdeveloped during key turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "symphonies of truth" felt not explained, final image reweights trust restoration without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo brilliantly—"concord of all that was" resonates as concrete experience, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (phonemes as "vows"), but filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stress moments lack compression; "hushed vibration" speech unrealistic when breath should hitch during intense focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("captured galaxy" simile repeated subtly); "dust-coated and nimble" borders stock phrasing. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("closed the tome"), but ink descriptions verge on overwriting in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes linguistic obsession trope through fresh "phoneme vows" mechanic; emotional truth avoids cliché. Glass ink well feels derivative but redeemed by specific integration with archive's starlight. Transformation test passed: plot fails if swapped with generic scholar.</comment>
