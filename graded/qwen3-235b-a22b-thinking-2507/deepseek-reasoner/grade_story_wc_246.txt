<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") embodied via pen twirling and "drowning in doubt" avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice inserting the pen reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in the final acceptance. But Kepler backstory remains summarized reflection without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "worthless, priceless artifact" crystallizes the shift from despair to "peace that comes not from having answers." Causal lens holds perfectly—pen insertion directly stabilizes the anomaly and reveals Elara's message. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly actively pressures choices (flickering lights trigger signal discovery), and the pen as micro-setting constrains the climax by fitting the calibration port. But occupational details of signal interpretation lack specificity beyond generic "scrolling figures."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the signal reframes the lichen as "a key," forcing Thorne’s agency via pen insertion. Cost is legible in the shift from "hollow work" to "quiet acceptance," with the anomaly’s stabilization embodying the earned trade-off between certainty and humility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "editing history through recontextualization" emerges organically from the pen/signal mechanics, avoiding moralizing. Final line—"learning how to ask the right questions"—resonantly answers the central query without stating a moral, reweighting the Kepler failure as necessary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cosmic noise," "humming silence") reflects Thorne’s scientific POV. Minor deduction for "drowning in doubt" (therapy-speak cliché), but stress-appropriate compression during signal decoding maintains rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "He inserted the tapered, exotic nib... felt a tiny mechanism click" delivers high density without scaffolding. One paraphrase loop ("meaning from experience that had defined his career") avoids penalty due to brevity and closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms terraforming-gone-wrong trope via gravitational mechanics; the pen’s dual role as comfort object/calibration tool feels inevitable. Risk-taking in cosmic signal-as-mentorship avoids gimmickry, heightening emotional stakes through specificity.</comment>
