<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pattern-avoidance struggle; "shards of glass in her mind" embodies emotional layering without labels. Final acceptance of inheritance earns closure through prior chaotic movement choices, though minimal backstory limits flaw depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "anguish melted into serene, joyful sorrow" crystallizes the cost of dissolved historical innocence with undeniable conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through escalating psychic residue density, each beat narrowing options via her method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The saffron veil constrains tactics (failing filter), while the archive's "psychic residue" actively lures her into biographical traps. Bronze prism evolves from observed artifact to resonant tuning fork in final image, charging closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten purely through protagonist agency: her zigzag path and random choices directly combat the archive's patterned lures. The cost—"loss of simple belief in history as mere record"—is legible in her real-time crossing of "a vast, experiential gulf."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the prism's transformation: "not a monument... but a tuning fork" reweights memory as active inheritance. Final image avoids moralizing while answering the central question—Khelathra's dissolution becomes "a steady, unpredictable song" felt in sorrowful joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is historian-sharp: "atoms of nostalgia" refracts light into "sorrowful hues," not generic sadness. Rhythm fractures under stress ("stepped sideways when she longed to move forward"), teaching the pattern early for payoff in chaotic navigation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fracturing the light into a thousand sorrowful hues" achieves high density without muddle. Minor cadence repetition in archive description ("its ceilings... its shelves") costs 0.2, but final line’s "new keeper of the song" shows rhythmic mastery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes via "atomized emotion" mechanics—the pagoda as tuning fork feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, culminating in closure where dissolution becomes inheritance.</comment>
