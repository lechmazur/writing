<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines in the memory ambush ("a sense memory, vivid and overwhelming, ambushed him"), but contradictory impulses lack depth; Silas's shift from reverie to action feels seamless without sufficient internal friction about his invisibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("He was the hand that offered the book") with felt cost of perpetual physical invisibility, under Accumulative/Textural lens; tape fragment’s discovery cleanly triggers the memory that reshapes his purpose without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (spooling it on broken reader) and charges closure as "treasured relic," while pipe chases enable tangible tactics like caching books behind radiators.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake ("to become visible... as a presence") tightens through Silas’s agency when memory transforms his method from delivering periodicals to caching comfort books, with cost legible in his retreat into walls despite the student’s discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Ms. Gable’s recording ("the human element is not in the system") reweighted by Silas’s final act; avoids moralizing as the tape fragment becomes "kindness itself" without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes and forgotten histories") persists under pressure; rhythmic compression during memory ambush ("a sense memory... ambushed him") avoids ventriloquism while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sapphire hush" and "ferromagnetic fragment" avoid purple prose while carrying thematic weight; final line’s metaphor ("kindly ghost in the machine") crystallizes closure without muddling cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "library ghost" trope through specific, verifiable details (pipe chases, obsolete tape reels); emotional truth in Silas’s quiet yearning avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in internal climax over action.</comment>
