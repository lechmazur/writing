<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; obsession lacks visible flaw-driven struggle despite strong embodied calm ("exhaled frustration away"). Micro-choices (breath sync, pushing harder) reveal values but flaw remains abstract, diluting cost of heartbeat's stilling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: mirror's reconfigured vision ("path of choices yet to be made") with undeniable conceptual cost ("borrowed heartbeat stilled"). Accumulative lens holds—density increase in light-flow climax narrows options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains every choice: water droplets refract light for painting, enable climax's "liquid gold" flow, and charge final image ("map of potential future"). Micro-setting elevates from tool to environmental necessity without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: frustration-to-command shift deepens knowledge ("not asking... commanding"), narrowing options to single decisive moment. Cost ("breathless," expended heartbeat) unmistakable but slightly detached from internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("bells... celebration, echoing") reweights "dusky harmony" into earned thematic answer: persuasion over force. Avoids moralizing while making conceptual cost (ephemeral possibility) resonate through concrete particulars like the mirror's shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "light as pigment," "coded lullabies" filter reality through artist-POV. Rhythmic control under pressure ("And then, it happened" shortening syntax) avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; elision taught early via sensory focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembling spectrum" to "liquid gold" progression shows high density without muddle. Final line ("simply persuaded them to listen") crystallizes theme through action. No figurative overwriting even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artist" trope via specific mechanics (prism physics, heartbeat rhythm). Fresh inflection: mirror shows not her vision but "raw" possibility. Emotional truth in quiet victory avoids abstraction—dusky harmony becomes earned resilience.</comment>
