<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows exhaustion but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal choice; "profound exhaustion" motivates refusal impulse yet answer feels under-pressured. Micro-choice of slicing twine reveals value hierarchy but grandfather's pull needs deeper internal friction. Final touch earns endurance with visible cost yet prior struggle lacks layered irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "hand on shoulder" crystallizes cost of permanent stillness with undeniable conceptual weight. Orientation perfect by paragraph one; causal lens holds throughout with no retroactive patches. Research montage slightly dilutes escalation but final descent tightens options meaningfully under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Broken lens functions as micro-setting that constrains restoration choices and charges final image with refracted light motif. Funeral parlour’s quietude mirrors protagonist’s psyche yet maritime archives lack tactile specificity. "Salt-encrusted twine" anchors early but kelp-draped columns feel postcard-like; environment shapes tactics only in lens work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chased stillness vs. answering call) tightens through protagonist agency: refusal impulse → lens restoration → descent. Research phase slightly stalls escalation but new moon sequence narrows options decisively. Cost is legible in grandfather’s preserved state redefining "rescue" as homecoming under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "permanent address" motif reframed by final image: stillness isn’t avoidance but belonging. Avoids moralizing while "distress signals" concept reweights pursuit of quiet as active communion. Grandfather’s journal transforms rescue into invitation without abstract commentary; closure offers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "funereal reverence" during lens repair; syntax shortens under deep-sea pressure. "Nearly extinct glassmakers" slightly drifts from undertaker lexicon but rhythm control during signal pulsing elevates tension. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly renders exhaustion as physical weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Hundred frantic, shimmering spectres" risks overwriting but pays off in closure’s refracted light. Zero loops or scaffold; "water-stained page" compresses backstory with propulsion. Final line’s "work was complete" avoids sentimentality through concrete action. Minor density spike in archives section doesn’t dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms sunken city trope through undertaker’s lens: "distress signals of light" feel fresh yet plausible. Emotional truth in seeking stillness avoids generic melancholy but underwater library lacks unique stakes. Bold structural choice embedding closure in discovery scene; specificity in "bone-handled letter opener" elevates beyond template.</comment>
