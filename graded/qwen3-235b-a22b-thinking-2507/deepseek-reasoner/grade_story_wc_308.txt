<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "holding both truths," but the arrowhead's "sudden, violent history imprinted" violates knowledge boundaries—unearned epiphany undermines embodied emotion during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("sacrilege" of contact), but the bird-flock method relies on coincidence rather than causal agency, narrowly avoiding resolution via luck under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Towers of bone actively constrain movement and perception ("climbed a stable arch"), charging the final image, though "centuries of dust" remains atmospheric rather than operationalizing time pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory disruption, but the wandering pulse resolution lacks protagonist agency—Kaelen stumbles upon the arrowhead, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" for meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "canyon's history was not a closed book" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing, reweighting harmony through the arrowhead’s integration as a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watched patterns in flock of birds") modulates with tension, but "violent history imprinted" momentarily breaches POV lexicon with omniscient abstraction during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in climax ("sudden, violent history imprinted") creates stock metaphor string, dulling immediacy; otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully with high density in sensory beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Fresh synthesis of "harmonic stone skimmer" and bone towers transforms tropes through specific sensory logic, though arrowhead discovery lacks bold risk—resolution feels inevitable but passive rather than actively earned.</comment>
