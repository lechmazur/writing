<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("luminous regret") and embodied motivation ("fierce hope") drive Elara’s final choice; micro-choices like stone-grasping during research reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: the stone’s metamorphosis reconfigures hope’s possibility with felt cost ("profound exertion"), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The river stone constrains choice (grounding tool) and charges the final image (galaxy-contained warmth); library’s flowering vines actively pulse with narrative-relevant light, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—discovering the shadow deepens knowledge, her dream-creation escalates pressure—making complacency’s cost legible via the stone’s transformation and draining exertion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the stone’s metamorphosis reweights "shape of hope" without moralizing; "borrowed nights" eroding ambition resonates through the shadow’s absence in modern dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") filters all description; rhythmic control shifts from measured observation to urgent creation, with "luminous regret" embodying voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sorrowful glow, like that of a dying star") propels momentum without muddle, though "fiercely personal" slightly edges toward label in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing dystopia via "shadow unbound" as creative potential; specificity of "river stone grounding" avoids tropes, with risk-taking in conceptual closure.</comment>
