<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Leo's embodied terror-to-recognition arc is strong but lacks contradictory impulses in the climax; his seamless acceptance of the supernatural misses a micro-choice where fear battles pull. Elara's motivation is clear yet her "venomous precision" remains descriptive rather than manifesting in a tradeoff (e.g., harming Leo to save the orchard). Interiority avoids labels but the grief/joy duality isn't tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: Elara's dissolution charges cost through "mournful elation" and the orchard's permanent radiance. Orientation is flawless within 120 words ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "alchemical orchard"). Accumulative lens holds—cameo appearances intensify density until the storm-triggered solidification narrows options to one decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains every choice: Leo's prism adjustments and root watering directly serve the orchard's survival, while the bead's geode universe charges the final image. Crystalline equations mirror internal states through action ("misaligned prism" reflecting Leo's confusion). Sensory details stay POV-rooted—Elara's "frosty caress" reveals Leo's gardener-hands sensitivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repaying love debt) tightens coherently under Accumulative lens: cameos escalate to solidification during the storm, narrowing Leo's options to acceptance. But pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Elara's actions dictate turns without Leo testing commitment (e.g., no moment he considers abandoning the orchard). Cost is legible in her dissolution but not actively earned by his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "debt repaid in opportunity" crystallizes through the orchard's shift from prison to crucible, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("resonant hum," "warm weight") offers non-literal resolution by reweighting the equations as renewal recipes. But "second chance" risks thematic echo; should show a single healed field crack instead of stating renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Leo notices orchard mechanics ("under-watered root") while filtering emotions through horticulture ("winter-cracked fields"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—short clauses during the storm ("She did not fade") contrast lyrical calm elsewhere. Zero head-hopping; the "lifetimes ago" reflection anchors to the bead's tactile cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "a story he had inherited... a tragic footnote" restates consecutively. "Resonant awakenings" appears three times like scaffolding, muddling peak beats. Otherwise pristine: "sun-drenched field, a laugh shared" delivers concrete propulsion. Final line ("resonant hum... warm weight") recharges motifs without cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transcends ghost-bride tropes via alchemical orchard growing equations—fresh synthesis where love debt fuels ecological renewal. Emotional specificity avoids generic grief: Elara's "mournful elation" embodies irreplaceable loss. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "black snow storm" feels derivative.</comment>
