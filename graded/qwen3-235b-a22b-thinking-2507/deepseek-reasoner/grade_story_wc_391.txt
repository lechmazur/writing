<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("searing impatience" vs sculpted patience) drives action, embodied in "restrained wildness" during measurement and dismantling. Final choice to unyoke counterweights earns cost through prior causality but motivation lacks concrete stakes beyond abstract "revolution."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dismantling the viaduct forecloses Kaelen's personal quest while creating legacy, with cost felt in "wildness... finally, perfectly restrained." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and magnetic viaduct actively constrain choices (lodestone compass spins, iron pulls boots). Final image of "field of fire" ice recharges "black glass" lake, charging closure. Micro-setting (frozen rain pearls) directly enables key discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through viaduct discovery: "bending light, paths, perception" shifts from abstract revolution to tangible cost. Agency drives escalation via calibrated sextant use and dismantling, but dominant stake ("patient revolution") remains slightly abstract until payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "sculpt patience" becomes literal dismantling. Final image reweights "revolution" as gentle redirection without moralizing. Risks thematic echo with "show his people their world was not fixed," narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flawless pane of black glass," "crystalline pearls") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from crisp ("He anchored himself") to lyrical ("dawn bled into sky") without artifacts. Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "lodestone compass spun wildly" compresses discovery. Minor register drift in "latent energy" (beat 2) slightly clashes with POV's pragmatic voice but pays off in viaduct mechanics. Zero loops; final line's callback charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist's discovery" trope through magnetic viaduct's specific physics. Fresh angle: revolution as redirection of natural forces. Avoids abstraction with "thousand crystalline pearls" detail. Derivative guardrail passed—no Wikipedia voice.</comment>
