<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (truth vs utility) drives final choice with visible cost; embodied emotion in "cog biting into palm" avoids therapy-speak. Elara's fear-to-curiosity shift earned through tool demonstration, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: Silas' withheld truth sacrifices historical accuracy for societal stability, crystallized when he transforms the cog into a teaching tool. Situational lens holds as pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (the brass cog) constrains the climax—Silas uses it to reframe the narrative, charging the final image where "fear slowly being replaced by rational curiosity" hinges on its physical manipulation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Silas' agency: competing narratives force a trade-off (truth vs utility) with conceptual cost paid in the closure beat. Pressure coheres under Situational lens as Elara's arrival crystallizes his internal conflict into actionable choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chronometer's transformation from relic to tool, rejecting moral binaries. Final image reweights "preservation" as pragmatic application without stated moral—resonant answer to "when to reveal truth" via embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sandpaper serenity" and sedimentary metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from isolation ("steady drip") to pressure ("careful splash"). Dialogue distinct: Elara's blunt "punishment" vs Silas' abrasive precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("deciphered," "biting"). Figurative language ("library," "sedimentary layers") integrates with POV without muddle. Final line's "dawning, rational curiosity" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic trope through philosophical lens: "preservation as application" avoids derivative nostalgia. Risk-taking (rejecting truth for utility) heightens stakes coherently, with sunken city specifics resisting generic "aftermath" tropes.</comment>
