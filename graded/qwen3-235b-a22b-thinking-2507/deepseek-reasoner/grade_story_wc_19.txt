<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs rebellion) manifests in embodied panic and micro-choices like gripping the doll; final renunciation of bunker mentality earned through the sprout's transformation. "Vacant blue eyes" slightly generic but offset by concrete notebook actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with tangible cost: the living sprout makes abandonment of claustrophobic identity irreversible. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density shifts from "terrifying" to "buoyant" silence during inversion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Porcelain doll functions as micro-setting constraining choices (gripping it as bunker substitute) and charging the final image ("secret promise against her thigh"). Trellis backdrop secondary but "gilded hush" evolution directly pressures the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of openness vs peace through silence) tightens via gravity inversion forcing stance crystallization. Agency in forcing eyes open during panic creates irreversible trade-off; cost made legible through the sprout's permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: cataloged silences reweighted by inversion's "potential" flavor. Final image (leaf as "secret promise") resonates without moralizing, avoiding binaries by showing father's world as incomplete not wrong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "flavors of silence" lexicon; rhythm modulates from staccato panic ("Panic seized her throat") to lyrical awe ("roaring, vertical silence"). Zero POV slippage despite high-stress shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "calm pulling taut like a rubber band" exemplifies high-density metaphor. Figurative language sparse but potent in peak beats, with final line ("no longer afraid of its quiet") avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via sprout during gravity inversion—fresh synthesis of claustrophobia and silence cataloging. Emotional specificity in "buoyant hush" avoids generic uplift, with risk-taking in making silence the active force.</comment>
