<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stoic mask" vs "resonant sorrow") powers choice to destroy; embodied grief in "poured every ounce of hope" avoids label-speak. Slight underdevelopment of "sensitive" trait during high-pressure dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "twilight now held not just embers, but a seed" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of shattered stagnation. Orientation flawless; Accumulative lens held through successive attempts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember Nexus constrains choices (obsidian floor's cold, cinders) and charges final image; crozier functions as micro-setting driving dissolution. "Forest shadow" light directly contrasts amber mist, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through "successive approximation" attempts narrowing options; cost of "destiny shattered" legible in final transformation. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens with visceral pressure in dissolution sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: crozier's transformation embodies "creative destruction" without moralizing. Final image reweights stagnation as "seed" with resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct alchemical lexicon ("atomic bonds dissolving," "vivify") modulates under pressure; "profound silence" line shows rhythmic control. Slight register drift in "convoluted formula" phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silent, shimmering wave" demonstrates high density without muddle. Single minor artifact: "powdered starlight" edges toward template cadence in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creative destruction" as subtraction alchemy; Ember Nexus avoids fantasy clichés. Risk-taking in making annihilation the path to life feels inevitable through prior causality.</comment>
