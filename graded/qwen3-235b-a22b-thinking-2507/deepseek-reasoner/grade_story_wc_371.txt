<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "find the sacred in the ordinary" drives concrete actions (crumbling bread, planting), but Anya remains underdeveloped as a pressure point; "heuristically gentle" reads as label without trade-offs. Interiority stays observational ("pang of loss") without layered contradiction under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise: the businesswoman's "uncommodified grace" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (ephemerality of sacred moments). Accumulative lens holds—repeated plantings deepen pressure without causal gaps. Cost is unmistakable in "fragile forgiveness for the sin of forgetting."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fossilized bread constrains choices (crumbling into gritty dust dictates gardening method) and charges the final image. Palace courtyard supplies seeds but doesn't actively pressure tactics; "overgrown" description stays atmospheric rather than altering moves. Sensory details ("oily paper," "gritty dust") are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: each planting deepens commitment to honoring loss, narrowing Elara's options to action without permission. The businesswoman's interaction makes stakes visceral ("uncommodified grace"), with conceptual cost in the fragility of the moment. Agency is clear, though trade-offs (e.g., risk of being caught) remain untested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: bread→flowers→"uncommodified grace" reweights "sacred in ordinary" without moralizing. Final image ("sacred... in a single flower grown from lost bread") delivers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids sentimentality via concrete acts (crumbling bread, scratching dirt) and conceptual cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("noticer of creeping normality") shines in details like "brittle and stained with oil" wrapping. Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical for reflection ("tenuous absolution"), clipped for action ("scratched a small hole"). Anya's sparse dialogue ("milled their own flour") feels character-particular without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "It did not soften, but turned into gritty, fragrant dust" achieve high density. Final line ("They had uncloaked it, together") recharges opening premise with precision. Minor over-telling ("reverence of a eulogy") avoids penalty by landing within 3 lines of embodied action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms guerrilla gardening trope through bread-as-seed medium and "uncommodified grace" as sacredness. Businesswoman's non-picking of the flower is a bold, quiet risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates; every detail serves the core premise of loss-as-fertility.</comment>
