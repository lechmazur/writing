<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("holding herself together" vs. envying fluidity) drives the crisis choice; laser pointer as crutch shows embodied flaw. Slight therapy-speak in "compulsion beyond duty" prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "grace to move through them" crystallizes stance shift with conceptual cost (her worldview shattered). Orientation flawless; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through spore crisis escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm actively constrains movement (plexiglass barrier, fungal shelves) and charges the final image—"ghost of a smile in the bioluminescent glow" reweights security through setting. Micro-setting essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully during crisis: her rigid vectors vs. his fluid navigation forecloses her "containment" path. Cost is visible in the laser pointer's recontextualization as "crutch," though spore crisis borders on convenient complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (his calm override vs. her panic button), not abstraction. Final line reweights "security" as movement rather than barriers—resonant, non-literal answer avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct spatial perceptual signature ("lattice of invisible lines," "geometry was all wrong") modulates under stress. Minor register drift in "profound silence when the world held its breath" prevents 9.1+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("navigated," "slipped," "receded"). "Quiet wildfire" metaphor avoids cliché by charging her mental shift. One near-duplicate stem ("never spoke, never made eye contact") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "familiar strangers" trope through spatial perception lens and security specialist stakes. Risk-taking (quiet crisis resolution) heightens coherence, though epiphany leans familiar; specificity in mushroom farm mechanics saves freshness.</comment>
