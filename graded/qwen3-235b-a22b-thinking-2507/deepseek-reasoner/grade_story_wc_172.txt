<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (egg warmth revelation, release over shatter), though "fractured grace" borders on abstract labeling. Final renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost in relinquishing control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "relinquish his claim" crystallizes stance with felt cost in "debt he could never repay." Orientation clear by paragraph 1, Accumulative/Textural lens held through salt flat's acoustic properties shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as active micro-setting: cracks guide movement, acoustics dictate the premise, rain erases footsteps. Final image of egg as "dark eye on widening map" charges closure through environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (authentic echo vs. manufactured legacy) tightens under Accumulative pressure. Thunder lull creates live clock, warmth revelation forces deepening. Minor deduction as thunder coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve the core choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "ghost was not in the air, but in him" reweights extinction legacy without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via specific stakes (egg release) and irreversible cost (erased footsteps).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked porcelain plate," "dendritic pattern") modulates under pressure. Minor filter verb ("he felt") in warmth revelation slightly dulls immediacy, but rhythmic control in climax ("He held the egg aloft...") elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "white dust coating his immaculate trousers" exemplifies textural density. One abstract phrase ("fractured grace") in mid-beat deducts 0.1, but final line's crystalline clarity preserves propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "guilty billionaire" trope through specific acoustics premise and emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though drought's ecological critique remains slightly familiar despite fresh salt flat execution.</comment>
