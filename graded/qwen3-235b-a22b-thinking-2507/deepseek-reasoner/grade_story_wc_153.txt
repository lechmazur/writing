<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pride vs need for forgiveness) act simultaneously in condensation scene; tears of release show embodied cost. Abandoning letters earns renunciation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes "within the decision" with visible cost (abandoned letters, tears). Accumulative lens holds perfectly: sensory density peaks at condensation revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mangrove leaf surface actively enables condensation message; moonlight healing constrains timing. Final image charged by silt/leaf/shard interplay—environment shapes every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via accumulative pressure (singing paths, leaf condensation), but escalation lacks one tangible narrowing of options before climax. Cost (emotional release) unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final leaf message reweights "fierce tenderness" without moralizing; abandonment of letters embodies earned renunciation. Theme emerges from mangrove/condensation particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("tea-dark water," scars as "souvenirs"), but "fierce tenderness" phrasing slightly overwrites peak moment. Rhythmic control flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mist weep from shard/beading on leaf" compresses ritual into two propulsive lines. Highest density in climax: "words written in water and light" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of gargoyle shard (prayer/weather) + mangrove leaf creates fresh emotional conduit. Risk-taking (condensation messages) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
