<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels: "ache in her bones" embodies silence's cost; contradictory impulses (fear/desire) act simultaneously when she touches the bear. Final choice earned through scribe's precision aligning with creator's intent, with visible cost in "poignant ache for the girl she had been."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the bear's chord reconfigures silence into "music" with undeniable cost ("making peace not with failure, but with a dream waiting"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the silence's density escalation forecloses retreat through sensory pressure, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal sculptures constrain choice (gentle movements to avoid shattering silence) and charge closure: final "rain and second chances" scent evolves from earlier petrichor, making the recurring object indispensable to the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally: silence's "glacial hush" deepens into the bear's manifestation, tightening options until her gear-push choice forecloses retreat. Cost is unmistakable in the "poignant ache" as she confronts buried ambition, driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "frozen mechanism in her soul" → bear's stilled gears → chord reweighting silence as "music." Final image ("rain and second chances") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: horologist's precision ("central gear," "mainspring") colors observation. Syntax modulates under pressure—long reflective clauses fracture into "A click sounded" during the climax, maintaining rhythmic control without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density: "air thick with petrichor nostalgia" weaves setting/emotion/backstory. Peak-beat clarity in "she gave the smallest, bravest push"—strong verbs and textural specificity propel closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: the bear (meant to "comfort, not frighten") subverts automaton expectations. Emotional truth in "making peace not with failure, but with a dream waiting" grounds universality through horologist-specific details, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
