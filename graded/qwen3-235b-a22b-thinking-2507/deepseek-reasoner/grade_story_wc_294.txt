<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; scavenger pressure underdeveloped as secondary character. Final renunciation earned but micro-choices during confrontation lack visible value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with felt cost ("weary understanding"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through money motif. No causality breaks; orientation clear by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Circus train functions as micro-setting: lion cage enables hiding, decay informs territorial markers. "Dusky harmony" evolves to stars, charging final image. Lacks constraint on one key choice to reach 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Leo’s agency (three money throws) under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "weary understanding" and abandoned strongbox. Dominant stake (breaking cycles) tightens meaningfully through protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from currency motif and cyclical imagery; avoids moralizing via action ("walked forward"). "Paths circle" reflection edges toward thematic echo but integrated with physical movement, dodging penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("polished calm," tactile money details) with rhythmic control. Minor filter verbs ("he felt") and uniform scavenger voice prevent 9+; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("serpent of peeling paint"). Slight overwriting in "dusky harmony" but no closure impact. No figurative muddle; final line’s propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "breaking cycles" through currency-as-artifact. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: generic setting would fracture emotional logic.</comment>
