<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (aloof intimacy vs. yearning) acts in scene during shell painting; micro-choice to leave rather than take the shell earns renunciation with visible cost. Slight underdevelopment of how flaws compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("revealed a part of her soul") under Accumulative/Textural lens; "lighter than she had in years" crystallizes the reconfiguration. Orientation clear by 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cave environment constrains choice (cannot replicate grandeur, paints shell instead) and charges final image; "impossibly clear water" and seashells directly shape tactics and closure. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling artistic promise) tightens meaningfully in cave chamber; agency-driven deepening as she paints the shell "as the cave felt" reweights options with felt cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of shell on stone altar offers resonant non-literal answer to "paint the truly felt" without moralizing; nostalgia/aloofness reweighted through concrete action. Avoids thematic echo despite high concept density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("chronicler of weathered wood") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from urgent dashes ("wind whipped her hair") to meditative cadence in cave. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt and ancient stone filled her lungs" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("visual echo of a promise") serves pressure without muddle. Final line recharges "temporary eternity" motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden cave" trope through specific emotional calculus (nostalgia as burden/gift); "painted shell as testament" is fresh inflection growing from established particulars. Avoids safety-middle in bold renunciation.</comment>
