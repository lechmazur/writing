<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied expertise (thumbed dictionary, "wanderingly exact" precision) but lacks interior contradiction under pressure; flawless competence undermines stakes. No visible cost in her Earned Stasis endurance weakens final causality despite coherent motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures cosmic opposition through linguistic synthesis, but conceptual cost remains abstract despite golden light imagery. "Felt cost" requirement fails—no exact sentence/image shows paid price, violating Q2 cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: dictionary constrains choices (definitions as "stitches") and charges final image (closed book preserving cycles). "Papyrus scrolls humming with dead stars' knowledge" embodies stakes through tactile, lived-in specificity that shapes arbitration tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation lacks protagonist agency—the Principles' struggle forces arbitration, but Elara's resolution feels preordained rather than earned through her choices. Stakes deepen texturally (golden light, intertwined smoke) but cost remains conceptual without tangible tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "spiral" reconfiguration: definitions become action ("stitches in grand reconciliation"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("spiral forever turning") resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact") modulates with pressure; rhythm tightens during arbitration. Minor register drift when defining chaos/order ("potential for all forms") edges toward diagnostic speech but remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density—"orreries of long-vanished solar systems hung frozen in brass" does triple duty. One paraphrase loop ("journeying inward while walking out") in high-pressure beat triggers −0.3 artifact penalty, blocking 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic mediation resolving cosmic duality avoids trope clichés. Risk-taking (quiet resolution via dictionary) heightens stakes coherently; "spiral arbitration" feels inevitable yet new through specific tool-driven execution.</comment>
