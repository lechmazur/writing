<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but emotional range narrow beyond melancholy. Final shift to "keeper of the ledger" earned through causality, yet no visible struggle with role beyond tapping anxiety. Coral memory fuels search but remains unconflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "slow, irrevocable thefts" crystallized in taped atlas and new records. Accumulative lens holds through data-pattern accumulation. Minor flaw: "delayed revelation" occurs off-page, slightly weakening causality despite effective payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station actively constrains choice (isolation forcing self-reliance) and charges closure: "taped it to the wall... measured beat against the metal hull." Sea's "sigh" evolves from background to emotional mirror. Micro-setting (atlas, tapping surfaces) directly shapes final image without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why paths disappear") deepens from geographical to existential through protagonist-driven escalation: atlas discovery → frantic data cross-referencing → conceptual realization. Cost ("profound, quiet heaviness") legible in closure. Pressure lacks one visible trade-off; deepening sufficient but not maximally tightened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: salt-poisoned marsh, taped atlas, "sound both drifting and moored." Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "paths disappeared" as irreversible loss without stated moral. "Slow thefts" risks thematic echo but saved by earned resonance through coral/memory integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "aluminum desk, glass of gauge panel, cool steel wall" filters professional bias. Rhythm modulates from staccato tapping to deliberate beats under pressure. "Periodically eternal" slightly jars lexicon but redeemed by consistent voice. Zero POV slippage; compression taught early via "periodically eternal" cycle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold: "pebble dropped into still pond of his routine" compresses impact. Minor overwriting ("bone-white branches reaching for a sun that only cooked them further") and abstract phrasing ("quiet, persistent hum") in early beats. Zero loops; final line’s cadence ("drifting and moored to deep, undeniable truth") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: environmental witness trope transformed via Accumulative structure and specific setting (monitoring station). "Periodically eternal" redefines time perception; atlas discovery avoids disaster porn by focusing on quiet accumulation. Emotional truth in "slow thefts" surpasses surface novelty. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
