<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in scientific precision ("silicate," "titanium tweezers") and embodied melancholy ("sweet sadness," muscles aching from cold) creates authentic contradiction between duty and grief. Final endurance earns visible cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: hologram's vanishing crystallizes Elara's role as witness to two lost worlds with visceral cost (physical endurance, miners' impending arrival). Accumulative lens holds through countdown intensification without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moon summit constrains choice (star alignment specificity) and charges final image; titanium tweezers enable grain retrieval. "Diamond-hard stars" and plummeting heater demonstrate sensory hierarchy under crisis. Environment shapes tactics relentlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving witness to vanishing beauty) tightens through countdown slowing and miners' dawn approach. Agency in enduring cold creates meaningful deepening; physical cost (aching muscles, stinging eyes) visibly alters tactics toward the alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through parallel acts of documentation (craters/lost civilization) without moralizing. Final image—"carried a last, precious photograph for two species"—resonantly answers "what survives?" through concrete particulars, avoiding false equivalence with miners' indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific lexicon ("silicate," "millennial dance") with poetic observation ("craters like faint silver thumbprints"). Voice modulates perfectly from clinical (grain analysis) to lyrical (alignment moment) under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "amber pulse" to "sustained soft glow" shows rhythmic escalation. Textural specificity ("diamond-hard stars," "recycled breath") replaces abstraction. Only minor register drift in "stark lunacy" (intentional poetic license) avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "alien message" trope via lunar science specificity and poignant parallel of two vanishing worlds. Bold quiet climax (hologram's 1-second vision) heightens stakes through emotional restraint rather than action, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
