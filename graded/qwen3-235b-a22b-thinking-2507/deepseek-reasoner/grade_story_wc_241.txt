<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs inherited compulsion—drives every choice; her trembling hands lighting the lantern embody micro-choice under pressure. Near-echo of "failed mystic" slightly edges toward thematic statement but remains grounded in her POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands unmistakably: dust motes crystallizing myriad possibilities into one sunlit streak reweights the premise with conceptual cost of understanding. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—clues accumulate density toward the lantern's superposition revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mica lantern constrains choice (must be held to window) and charges the final image; rainwashed library's beeswax scent and wet window directly enable the clover-melancholy transformation. Micro-setting isn't backdrop but active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single deepening—lighting the lantern—narrows options under Accumulative lens, transforming "sharp" melancholy into layered understanding with visible conceptual cost. Her agency (ignoring scientific skepticism) forecloses rejection path while charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lantern's superposition metaphor, not statement; final dust motes offer resonant non-literal answer to "seeing the world as it could be." Avoids moralizing—cost is the "terrifying, beautiful weight" of probabilistic vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: notices probabilistic patterns ("cryptic scrawls as notations"), academic framing ("tangible model of superposition") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control in climax ("two, then three, then a cascade") avoids cadence loops while teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clover melancholy" evolves from bitter to layered without muddle. Final line’s dust motes recharging prior motifs demonstrates high density—every phrase does triple duty (e.g., "gleaming city" implies rain’s cleansing and emotional residue).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms gambling trope via probability theory lens; "mica pane revealing superposition" is specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in making math visceral ("poet of probability") heightens stakes without gimmickry—the lantern’s physics is indispensable to closure.</comment>
