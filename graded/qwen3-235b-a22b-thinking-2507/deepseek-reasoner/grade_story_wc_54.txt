<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's "functionally creative" trait drives tangible choices (sextant as calibrator), but emotional embodiment during climax lacks physical sensation—steam's heat on skin would heighten cost. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy (prioritizing conduit alignment over fatigue), yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped beyond professional focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis: the steam plume's "sign of life" crystallizes entropy-to-potential with felt cost (implied future labor). Causal lens holds perfectly—each step (sextant discovery → solar mapping → valve adjustments) narrows options toward the self-sustaining system. "Quiet victory measured in degrees" charges the final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The spaceport's fractured dome and capillary pipes actively constrain choices—light angles dictate sextant alignments, permacrete echoes emphasize isolation. Sextant's brass coldness and calibration function charge the climax when steam rises from "barren planting bed," making environment indispensable to the closure's physical reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around transforming entropy into purpose; the capillary repurposing tightens options meaningfully. Cost is legible in "profound focus on integrity" during labor, but the "three days" ellipsis softens tactical stakes—showing a specific struggle (e.g., rusted valve resistance) would deepen the price paid for resurrection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "equations of hope" becomes literal solar calibrations, not abstraction. Final line reweights "entropy" via steam's "quiet victory," avoiding moralizing. Sextant's shift from relic to functional tool embodies the non-literal answer—navigation repurposed for nurturing—but secondary "maze" motif lacks full integration with closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct engineer POV: "fractured dome glass" (not "shattered"), "capillary pipes" (not "tubes"). Syntax tightens under pressure ("Steam began to curl... Then, a miracle"). Only minor flaw: "stoic wonder" slightly drifts into label-speak, though redeemed by immediate action ("cleaned lenses and opened valves").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "beam of light pierced... striking... bounced, then split" propels physics with rhythmic precision. Figurative language serves function ("graveyard of grandeur" contextualizes decay). Deduct 0.1 for "puzzle out new equations for hope"—slightly abstract for engineer's thought, though motivationally apt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant as solar calibrator transforms space-exploration trope into sustainable engineering. Avoids cliché by grounding "hope" in fluid dynamics. Risk-taking (quiet climax without dialogue) heightens stakes coherently, though "carnival left town" feels underutilized. Derivative safety avoided via specific capillary mechanics.</comment>
