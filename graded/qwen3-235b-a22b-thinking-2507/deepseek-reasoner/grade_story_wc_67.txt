<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) manifest physically in brush control and embodied grief; the final witnessing choice is earned through her process. No second character limits relationship dynamics but single-POV baseline is fully met with micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the dissolving ash reweights "safety" as illusion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to the sneeze's inevitability. Cost legible in "powdered ash settled as faint dust upon the floor".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The porcelain mask constrains every action (must hold steady) and charges closure as the dissolving portrait's ghost; rocking chair's stop creates live environmental pressure. Micro-setting qualifies as "tool" under gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake crystallization tightens via environmental pressure (rocking chair stop → stillness) and the sneeze's consequence, narrowing options to witnessing. Cost is visceral in the portrait's dissolution, though protagonist agency is observational rather than active.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: ash portrait dissolving reweights "mirage of safety" without moralizing. Final dust-on-chair image delivers non-literal answer to transience, avoiding sentimentality through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "brittle, terrifyingly beautiful mask") with rhythmic control under pressure; syntax compresses during high-stakes dusting ("Each movement was a meditation"). No head-hopping; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "gust of air, insignificant in any other room" shows high density. Slight register drift in "profound quiet" (abstract for POV) prevents 9.0, but closure beat ("powdered ash settled") maintains crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "art about loss" trope through specific mechanics (ash portraits, mask as stencil); the sneeze's destruction feels earned by established fragility. Avoids sentimentality with "sacred, temporary grace" as fresh inflection.</comment>
