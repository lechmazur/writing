<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines ("hard sob rose... came out as soft sigh") and micro-choices like prying the fragile box lid deepen her flawed resolve. But "bargained innocence" concept lacks visceral, pre-closure enactment of the trade-off's physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("innocence she had bargained was the belief that she could always win") under Accumulative lens. One tightening via ash release crystallizes the stance shift, though the celestial dance risks slight thematic overreach in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box functions as micro-setting, constraining her delicate handling ("fragile, but her movements... tender") and charging the closure when emptied. Ash scent and moonlit ridge ground the atmosphere, but celestial motifs verge on over-symbolism without fully constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her reflection on the ashes, narrowing options to witnessing rather than saving. The cost ("belief in her own infallibility") is legible, but escalation relies solely on internal realization without tangible pressure beyond the box's physical fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash-as-metaphor without moralizing, with the final release reweighting "bargained innocence" as "profound understanding." Avoids sentimentality, though "translate pain into universal language" borders on thematic echo in the reflection block.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots scuffing," "cold ash scent") and rhythmic control under pressure ("hard sob... soft sigh") elevate voice. Reflection stays anchored in tactile cues, though "enlighten the silence" momentarily strains toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ropey burn stretched from her temple" exemplifies textural specificity. But "hard softness" repetition risks thematic echo, and "enlighten the silence" slightly muddles the prose in a high-pressure beat without sufficient pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-translation through firefighter specificity avoids cliché, with ash release as bold, earned resolution. Lacks one transformative inflection beyond the core metaphor to reach 8.5+, though "carrying" reframes heroism with emotional truth.</comment>
