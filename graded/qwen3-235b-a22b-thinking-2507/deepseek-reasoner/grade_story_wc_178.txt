<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "empirically ironic" thrill and "I am deciphering" climax; closure choice (accepting burden) earned through micro-choices like tracing the square under threat. Priestess pressure crystallizes his hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: calculation directly counters chant, leading to Earned Stasis closure where "accepted burden" legibly reconfigures stakes. Cost crystallizes in final image ("solemn secret") without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Tile functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must calculate patterns) and charges closure ("weight now a solemn secret"). Sensory details like "smoldering vellum" evolve with pressure, avoiding static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when priestess appears: discovery shifts to survival, then understanding. Kalanu's agency drives escalation (calculation counters magic), with cost undeniable in "not gained power... accepted burden" closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "encrypted devotion" becomes literal key, answered non-literally by final guardianship acceptance. No moralizing; "burden for it" reweights "covenant" with conceptual cost without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: astronomer notices "cuneiform wedges" and "constants." Rhythm modulates under stress (shorter sentences during chant), with final line recharging "frugal" motif through "solemn secret."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("thrill that was empirically ironic" conveys layered meaning). Final line crystallizes theme without stating it; "ochre light" to "solemn secret" creates resonant bookends with zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic square as prison lattice reframes "command" trope. Emotional truth in scientist confronting limits via "sum of opposite corners" command. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3 distinction).</comment>
