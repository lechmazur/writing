<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (recoiling then holding ground), but "complementary opposites" risks over-articulation in climax. Tears as rekindled existence deliver visible cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("tears streaming... for first time in years"). Causal lens holds flawlessly from Rin's instruction to integration. History stabilization crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating dojo actively constrains choice as temporal anchor, while the brain jar's physical handling (recoil → hands on glass → darkening) charges the final image. Micro-setting drives the entire arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen's agency: his shift from "I can't" to welcoming the torrent narrows options decisively. Cost is visceral in the tears' specific ambiguity ("not of sadness or joy").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("calm as bowl/storm as water"), avoiding moralizing. Final tears reweight numbness as paralysis versus "profound existence" without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "continents bleed" and "screaming aether." Rin's razor-sharp diction contrasts Kaelen's hollow syntax, with rhythmic compression during integration ("grief so deep it could drown stars").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "symphony of a life lived" shows high density without muddle. Final line ("feeling the entirety of his past") avoids cliché through precise specificity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "clone" trope via neural integration premise. Emotional specificity in "tears not of sadness or joy" avoids sentimentality, though ego death concept borders on familiar territory.</comment>
