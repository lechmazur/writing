<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "orders clear: report... but fragment felt like a plea," with embodied empathy driving her choice; micro-choices like recoiling shadows show consistent traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("reconstituted a broken future into a mended present"), but "weighted breath" repetition slightly dulls the final image's uniqueness under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard’s frost-bitten apples and groaning ice constrain choices (e.g., shadows recoiling from light), charging the final image where ice groans "faithfully" as active setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from observation to valve intervention; cost is visceral in "reconstituted broken future," though moral calculus could deepen the valve-tradeoff moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal’s "diagnosing the present" reframing fate as solvable pressure—no moralizing, but "map empathy onto action" borders on label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice remains distinct under pressure ("calmly intuitive, mind a still pool"), with perceptual signature in "cloudy, scratched mirrors"; no POV drift despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Weighted breath before reply" repeats verbatim in climax, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls closure; otherwise crisp propulsion and sensory specificity elevate prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "anomalous courage" with municipal engineering avoids cliché, though "shadow-laced peacekeeper" leans on familiar archetypes without radical transformation.</comment>
