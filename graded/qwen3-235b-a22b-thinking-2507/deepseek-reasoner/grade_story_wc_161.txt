<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "reinvents personal history daily" versus trembling with purpose; embodied emotion in dust mote mapping as anchor, though "across learning to trust again" borders on diagnostic phrasing risking 0.3 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she no longer needed to map them" crystallizes stance shift with visible cost in the post office walk; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with paper trails tightening pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains choices (ledgers in dusty boxes) and charges closure via dust motes' reprise; meteorite's "impossibly heavy" weight functions as body-object constraint, though bookshop details lack occupational specificity affecting higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: paper trails investigation narrows options from isolation to risky exposure, culminating in the post office walk where "looking the clerk in the eye" delivers unmistakable cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "echo of lost songs" evolving into "new fragile note" without moralizing; final image reweights prior material as Conceptual Repricing where dust motes symbolize relinquished control with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "map the swirl of dust motes" reflecting Elara's controlled chaos; rhythmic control peaks in closure ("charting a different course... messy, dangerous, beautiful heart"), though "across learning to trust again" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; meteorite description ("cold and impossibly heavy") achieves high density without figurative muddle; final line's cadence shift ("preserving a song... new fragile note") delivers propulsion while charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon training (controlled chaos) with paper trail investigation feels inevitable; meteorite as extinction echo transforms "trust" trope through specific emotional calculus, though geologist's offstage fate limits freshness.</comment>
