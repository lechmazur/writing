<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in curiosity as both strength and vulnerability; embodied choices under pressure (picking photo, following pulses) earn the promise with visible cost ("box heavy in her arms"). Slight tell in "greatest vulnerability" label slightly mars otherwise concrete motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flawless causal chain: photo → hearing aid → whisper → box discovery → release. Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost ("duty was now to speak") and legible causal escalation under Causal lens. Orientation anchors by 100 words with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium actively pressures choices: mossy tiles enable silent movement, loose tile hides box. Hearing aid functions as micro-setting constraining tactics. Final "mist parting" charges closure image, satisfying 9+ gate through environmental constraint on action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (truth vs. silence) tightens when whisper reveals architect's crime, forcing Elara's promise. Agency-driven escalation under Causal lens with visible cost in physical burden and duty shift. "Box heavy in her arms" makes cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: buried reports reweight "incidental heroism" from quiet tracing to speaking duty. Final image ("speak, to protect the voice") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight deduction for "incidental heroism" label risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reeling hush," "vaporous tendrils") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control excels in whisper sequence ("fractured and terrified: '...don't let him...'"). Minor scaffold in "Her motivation, as always..." slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines multi-job ("thick, vaporous tendrils coil around skeletal remains"). Final line ("The dead had called, and she had answered") charges closure with crystalline rhythm. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" transforms ghost trope through specific occupational lens. Emotional truth in "burdened by truth" avoids derivative safety middle. Fresh synthesis evident but premise retains familiar haunting elements limiting 9+ eligibility.</comment>
