<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in Pascal’s tail repair; "war within" slightly edges toward label-speak but micro-choices (shedding bitterness, aligning tail tip) concretely manifest values. Final renunciation of vengeance earns through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure tightens via sensory density (mist, adhesive viscosity) toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "the injury was her fault" and meticulous repair. Orientation clear by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workshop functions as micro-setting: warm lamp enables tail repair, tools constrain action. Final "shimmering stillness" recharges mist’s meaning with earned cost. Body (Pascal’s shifting skin) charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake crystallization (self-respect vs compassion) deepens through tail repair’s physicality. Agency drives escalation, but "shed layers" method lacks early signaling to fully constrain mid-beat tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through tail repair’s evolution: "apology," "mending with intention." Final image reweights "fragile convictions" without moralizing. Cost in "temporary bonds worth repairing" avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices adhesive viscosity, color shifts on Pascal. Rhythm modulates from fragmented ("silence and mist") to flowing during repair. Zero POV leaks; stress compresses diction organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor abstraction in "conviction... lay shattered" risks scaffold, but redeemed by concrete action. No fatal loops; "single-hair brush" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wildlife handler’s trauma reframed through chameleon biology. Emotional specificity ("guilt that threatened to paralyze") avoids templates. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
