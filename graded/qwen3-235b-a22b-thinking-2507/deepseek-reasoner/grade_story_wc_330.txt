<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows quiet persistence through action (singing despite disuse), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; closure choice to carve is earned yet internal conflict remains surface-level without deeper friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within 100 words; Charged Poise closure lands with palpable cost in "air charged with potential" and tools' "familiar weight," holding Accumulative/Textural lens through mist-to-light progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carousel horse as micro-setting constrains choice (initiating carving) and charges final image; "tap-tap-tap" reweights silence from emptiness to creation, satisfying 9+ gate through tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency (singing → vision → carving decision) deepens stakes under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "charged with potential" air, though pressure lacks one tightening that forecloses an option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "tap-tap-tap" offers resonant answer to "silence as possibility" without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete actions (singing, carving) and reweighted halo fragment, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sound-focused details ("crystalline ring," "rough from disuse"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure with purposeful fragments ("a moment stretched thin"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-perfect density but minor overwriting in "bruised purple sky" and "scabrous metal" slightly blurs physical logic; no loops or scaffold, though "halo fragment" description risks figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned circus trope through carpenter's silence; risk-taking in quiet closure feels inevitable, with "wind bells" chime transforming silence into creative catalyst without gimmickry.</comment>
