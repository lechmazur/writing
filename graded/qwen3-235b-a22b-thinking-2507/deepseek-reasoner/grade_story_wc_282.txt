<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; motivation shifts too smoothly from mapper to singer without struggle. Grief embodiment strong ("aching loss, almost a scent") but micro-choices under pressure absent—no hesitation when touching the fossil or altering her device. Final endurance earned but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly (fossil's color shift, "keeper of stories" crystallization) with felt cost. Lens ambiguity past midpoint—Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid—triggers -0.3 deduction despite strong Charged Poise ending. Orientation clear by para 2, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal cave network functions as micro-setting: the fissure forces physical transition that enables emotional climax, and the emotion mapper tool directly charges the final image ("ears still ringing"). Salt/stone sensory details avoid genericity by filtering through Elara's professional focus on "lingering psychic residue."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightening is exemplary Accumulative escalation: placid blue maps → crimson overload → sound transformation. Protagonist agency drives the deepening ("adjusted her device, synced readings"), with cost unmistakable in the cello note's "infinite sadness." Single meaningful intensification perfectly scaled for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—no moralizing. The fossil's transformation from "reliquary" to "partner" offers resonant answer to ecological grief without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality via specific sensory translation ("cello-like note," "gold pulse").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("taste of salt," "flickered wildly" mirroring emotional overload), with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "factually mystical" (academic diction) slightly jars established voice. No POV slips; compression taught early via sensory shorthand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wave of profound, aching loss" avoids cliché through embodied specificity. Nominalization in "methodically heat-mapped emotions" is the sole hairline flaw. Final line ("beautiful, terrible music of memory") achieves high-density propulsion with crystalline closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms relic trope via ecological grief made tangible through quantum-adjacent tech. Emotional specificity in "infinite sadness and acceptance" avoids generic elegy. Risk-taking (sound as translated emotion) heightens stakes coherently—removing the cello note would break closure's emotional weight.</comment>
