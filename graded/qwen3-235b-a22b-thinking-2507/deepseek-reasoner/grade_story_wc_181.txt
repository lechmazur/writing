<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her scholarly curiosity versus terror of predestination, embodied through micro-choices like snatching back from the fruit. Slight emotional summary ("philosophical panic") prevents 9.0 despite otherwise concrete, character-particular voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the cameo resolving into her face reweights inheritance as active choice. Orientation anchors by word 40, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through the journal’s real-time scripting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The astral orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint—shifting soil pressures her footing, pulsing fruit dictates her hesitation. Crystalline bark and nebula fruit charge the final image, making environment indispensable to the closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around forbidden knowledge pursuit, tightening when the journal forces the fruit/home choice. Escalation via protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in her transformation ("knowledge flooded... as a new way of seeing").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blank cameo’s evolution—inheritance as choice, not receipt—without moralizing. Final image reweights "nonlinear inheritance" as self-creation, resonating through concrete action ("carve it with her own decision") rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scholarly precision ("gloved thumb," "ozone and nectar") modulates under stress into fragmented urgency. Rhythmic control in high-pressure beats (e.g., "She needed to think, to break the narrative") avoids uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful density ("cheerful and profound wrongness"), but paraphrase loop in "beauty suffused with brightened disquiet, a cheerful and profound wrongness" incurs minor scaffold penalty in Q7.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope through specific, grounded choices: cosmologist’s bathroom habit, pistachio shell cameo. Emotional truth in her hesitation ("hand no longer hesitant") avoids generic templates, with risk-taking heightening coherence.</comment>
