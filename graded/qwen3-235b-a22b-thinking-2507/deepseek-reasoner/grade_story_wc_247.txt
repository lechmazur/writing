<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied motivation ("hum in her blood") and contradictory joy/sorrow avoid label-speak; grandfather's memory-pressure drives choices without therapy jargon. Micro-choice raising camera toward city shows hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when engine cuts out—cost visible in grandfather's fading. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: silence density builds then shatters, reweighting stakes via her mapping. Minor deduction for speedboat's abrupt stall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor isn't backdrop but active constraint: moon-path guides her framing, water textures define musical mapping. Camera (tool) charges final image—lowering it after victory crystallizes earned solitude. Micro-setting essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from preserving harmony to defending it against violation; her agency in mapping the noise's silence drives escalation. Cost is grandfather's departure—conceptual price of victory. Slight convenience in speedboat's stall prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars: "joyful sorrow" tone avoids moralizing, while final image of secret music echoing in her soul reweights silence's value without stating it. No thematic echo—pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: camera viewfinder shapes all description, rhythm mirrors musicality ("deep, resonant tone began to swell"). Minor deduction for one elevated phrase ("fractured only by bobbing lights") edging toward writerly voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero drumbeat rhythm; "shimmering path the moon cast" exemplifies textural density. Deducted for synonym loop: "fragile vault of her own mind" followed by "preserved only in..." repeats fragility concept unnecessarily.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language/music mapping transforms familiar tropes; risk-taking lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight deduction as speedboat's "lonely need" motivation borders on predictable emotional shorthand.</comment>
