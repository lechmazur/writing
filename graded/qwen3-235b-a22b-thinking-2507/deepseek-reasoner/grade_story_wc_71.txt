<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("fingers touched it, the ambient sounds vanished") but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice earned yet no meaningful trade-off shown during ritual participation shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds ("house breathed with her, content") with legible cost in purpose shift, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure tightening—the confluence vision occurs without resistance or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (shard of hush) constrains perception during key beats, yet bay/spring details remain decorative; final "lap of water" image charges closure but setting never pressures choices beyond supplying the stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding house aliveness) deepens via object discoveries, but escalation lacks visible cost until the very end; pressure grows too smoothly without narrowing options or complicating tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through objects ("love lingers as tangible energy"), but direct statement ("inadvertently profound truth") risks Thematic Echo; final image avoids moralizing yet insight lacks layered complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality of silence," "hushed blaze") with rhythmic control; voice modulates perfectly from watchful to companionable tone without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density ("brittle tissue," "perpetual cool hush"); only minor register drift in "inadvertent archaeologist" and borderline mixed metaphor ("hushed blaze") prevent 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of haunted house trope through positive residue of love; "shard of hush" elevates concept, but ritual object-hiding feels familiar without transformative risk-taking in execution.</comment>
