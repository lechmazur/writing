<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation for intergenerational support drives all action; embodied contradiction in "solemn grace" masking desperate scanning eyes shows interiority under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the bell’s echo crystallizes "We are not alone" with conceptual cost of shattered isolation, validated by Accumulative/Textural lens where patterned donations reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bell’s physicality—"smoky patina," "polished handle"—constrains Elara’s choice (not ringing it initially) and charges the final image; terrain details ("mud-caked," "choked vines") shape movement and mood organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s failed run leading to the bell’s discovery; pressure accumulates via donation pattern until the declaration reconfigures "hope" from scarcity to partnership with felt cost of lost anonymity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell’s transformation: "partnership, not charity" avoids moralizing; final echo reweights donations as collective resilience without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV filters sensory details through communal urgency ("hunger for hope," "wind humming like mournful choir"); rhythmic control peaks in the bell declaration’s cadence without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thin broth," "mud-caked," and "smoky patina" exemplify textural specificity; final line’s echo delivers propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes via "anonymous donations as partnership" synthesis; the bell’s irreplaceable role in reframing hope feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-hedging.</comment>
