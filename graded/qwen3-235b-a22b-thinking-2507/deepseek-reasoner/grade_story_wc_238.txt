<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (apology vs. fear of rejection) embodied through micro-choices like placing the bottle while voice trembles; visible cost in Leo's tears and enduring orchard loss. Slight pacing dip in Leo's shift from flat refusal to nod, but strain of induced current scene mitigates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the scent of apples remained" crystallizes reconnection against orchard destruction. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to glowing music; orientation anchors within 100 words. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting charges closure by releasing orchard essence that persists beyond ritual. Archive constraints choices (sheet music enables reconnection); "dust motes danced... not falling" exemplifies purposeful sensory selection reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: dawn deadline and induced current ritual deepen knowledge (mother's music revealed), narrowing options to emotional reconnection. Cost legible in Leo's tears and "orchard is falling" line; agency clear in Elara's ritual initiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "reconnect the memory to the joy" crystallizes without moralizing. Final scent/image reweights loss with resilience, avoiding thematic echo; orchard's song persisting offers resonant answer to "silence after you wrote what you did."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "cathedral of forgotten sound" filters setting through Elara's exorcist lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("a sharp stone in her shoe" to fragmented ritual descriptions); dialogue subtext ("They’ll turn her orchard...") avoids exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scent began to weep into the air" exemplifies high-density prose doing triple duty (action, metaphor, stakes). Final line’s specificity ("scent of apples remained") avoids abstraction; rhythm accelerates during ritual then breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" trope transformed through induced currents as emotional tool. Fresh inflection: scent coalescing with sheet music makes memory tangible. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("tarnished silver filigree") avoids genericity.</comment>
