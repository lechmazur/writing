<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (grieving joy he seeks), embodied emotion via "mournfully eager" and "arms aching," but micro-choices under pressure lack deeper hierarchy—e.g., no visible tradeoff between precision and rawness during the leaf-blowing ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "weathered and healing" laughter reconfigures absence into new music. Accumulative lens holds tightly (sound density → fragile giggle), but "mournfully eager" trait isn’t tested under peak pressure to elevate causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel constrains every choice (sound multiplication forcing ritual), and the pull cord’s reappearance charges closure. Micro-setting triumph: "colorful dust" on Silas makes environment inseparable from emotional transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally (silence → spectral lullabies → laughter) with visible cost in "macerated past." Agency-driven escalation excels, but the giggle’s emergence risks slight coincidence—though wife’s silhouette justifies it under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "tending to the unspoken" via wind, not words. Final laughter as "counter-melody" reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality by embracing weathered imperfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crimson, gold, ochre" as calendar pages) and rhythmic control (mechanical roar vs. fragile giggles) shine. Minor deduction: "spectral lullabies" edges toward stock phrasing, slightly diluting voice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("yanked the cord. The engine sputtered..."), but repetitive leaf color listing ("crimson, gold, ochre" twice) creates a scaffold loop. Final line’s "macerated past" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual through sound physics—leaf blower as conductor’s tool feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk distinction: industrial destruction creating new laughter heightens stakes while honoring emotional truth. No derivative tropes.</comment>
