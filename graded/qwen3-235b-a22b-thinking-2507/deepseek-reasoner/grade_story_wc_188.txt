<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in profession ("designed not for applause but for awe"), embodied doubt during fuse lighting, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; micro-choices under pressure feel authentic though limited by single-beat conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight lifted, filtered away by remembered joy"), orientation clear by 50 words, Accumulative lens held through atmospheric deepening; minor deduction for cost legibility slightly softened by poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice (mosaic dictates firework design) and charges final image ("radiant rain watering stone petals"); sensory hierarchy perfect for urgency—kerosene smell cutting dust, silence thickening before ignition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens (doubt → "Remember" → ignition), dominant stake ("defy hopelessness") tightened meaningfully; deduction for visible price paid during process being implied rather than dramatized (e.g., no tool loss or time cost).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Remember" motif reweighted in finale ("night was no longer empty"), no moralizing; final image offers resonant answer to hopelessness through light-as-memory without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sanguine light bled," "soft profound thump"), rhythmic control under pressure (compressed syntax during doubt), no head-hopping; deduction for slight register drift in "gravity of hopelessness" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("grinding powders and mixing compounds" avoids synonym churn), propulsion via cadence shifts; minor deduction for "profound melancholy clung to mortar" bordering on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms artist-heals-place trope through specific constraints (mosaic blueprint, kerosene knot); risk-taking in quiet climax feels inevitable. No safety-hedging—flaws (doubt) compound before earned resolution.</comment>
