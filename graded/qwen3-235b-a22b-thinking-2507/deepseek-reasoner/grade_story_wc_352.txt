<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; motivation clear but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction beyond "time slipping away." Prism-mind trait drives action yet remains purely cognitive without emotional tension (e.g., no fear of failure warring with duty).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "permanent, vigilant flame" crystallizes options with felt cost during the leap ("hung between two states"). Causal lens holds throughout, though gravity reversion timing slightly strains physics without prior rule-establishment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices decisively: inverted gravity forces timed exit, luminous fungi’s pulse dictates pace, and mist-cloud floor enables access. Final pod image ("tiny, steadfast star") charges closure by reweighting the "latent blaze" motif through concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time-limited access) tightens through the fungi’s flickering warning and tremors, forcing the escape leap. Cost is legible in the threshold limbo moment, though gravity’s mechanics lack visceral consequence beyond physical peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance emerges organically from the seeds’ function and final "vigilant flame" image, avoiding moralizing. Central question ("how to guard against forgetfulness") resolves non-literally through the pod’s integration into consciousness, though "sleep of forgetfulness" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured light into constituent truths") colors all description, with syntax tightening under pressure ("ran back," "groaning"). Minor register drift in "biological clock" anthropomorphism slightly disrupts the archivist’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("clandestinely luminous" efficiently conveys setting/stakes). Final paragraph’s "memory of inverted world... permanent flame" achieves resonant cadence, though "latent blaze" repetition in opening/closing edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work with physical quest: "prism-mind" transforms trope into active problem-solving. Risk-taking (gravity inversion as plot engine) heightens stakes coherently, avoiding gimmickry through meticulous causal logic.</comment>
