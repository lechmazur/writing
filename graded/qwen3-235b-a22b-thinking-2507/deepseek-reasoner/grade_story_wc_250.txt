<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's silent empathy manifests through tactile teaching (mirror/shutters), avoiding therapy-speak; Elian's embodied conflict—trembling hands to aching arms—shows silent voice finding expression. Minor deduction: Kael's backstory lacks contradictory impulses beyond the core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("arms ached but spirit light") under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via Elian's agency weaving light patterns. Orientation anchors by line 3 (canal guardian, rain-slick dock), avoiding disorientation penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dock’s rain-darkened planks and water surface constrain choices (mirror reflections, light patterns), directly charging the closure’s "borrowed constellation." Dental mirror functions as micro-setting, transforming from tool to voice conduit without ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes (Elian’s voice/silence) tighten through his agency—clumsy rope pulls to intentional storytelling—under Accumulative lens. Physical cost (aching arms) and emotional vulnerability crystallize the trade-off; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light-weaving actions, not moralizing; the final "borrowed constellation" reweights "silence as cage" into resonant answer. Avoids sentimentality by rooting hope in concrete effort ("trembled" to "spirit light").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature ("spiralingly calm grace," "stillwater tension") filters all details; rhythmic control peaks in shutter sequence ("Open, closed, open, open"). Compression ("half-spoken secret") teaches pattern early, paying off in closure’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wavering pinprick of the evening’s first star" multiplies meaning through concrete image. Final line’s "borrowed constellation" recharges "value of stars" with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms mute-child trope via canal-specific light-weaving: dental mirror as star-catcher reframes silence as canvas. Risk-taking (dialogue-free communication) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors freshness.</comment>
