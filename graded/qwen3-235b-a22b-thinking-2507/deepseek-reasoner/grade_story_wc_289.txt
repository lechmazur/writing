<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("borrowed room" heart vs. professional detachment), but pivotal shift from ghostwriter to architect lacks concrete struggle; the nest discovery triggers immediate resolve without showing her wrestling with exposure risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: projected words on temple/pond reconfigure private/public with undeniable cost ("no longer keeper of secrets but witness"). One hairline slip—the thrush nest coincidence complicates but doesn’t deepen her agency before the art decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lotus temple actively charges closure: its white surface becomes the canvas for projected secrets, while lily pond’s reflection doubles the meaning. Vellum’s translucence—a micro-setting tool—constrains the lantern’s mechanics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake ("find the thread") tightens when the nest reveals physical proof, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; her leap to public art feels passive despite the conceptual cost. Agency shines in vellum choices, yet the thrush’s role edges toward coincidence complicating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "roots of lilies" → "magnificent tapestry" avoids moralizing. Final image ("thread was real, and she was holding her end") answers the central question non-literally, with conceptual cost in her identity shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew on spiderweb" as professional hazard) and rhythmic control elevate quiet moments, but "prone to seeing metaphor" slips into label-speak during peak tension, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "light bloomed through the twig spiral" shows concrete action. One mixed metaphor ("ghost in the machine of the heart") risks clarity, but closure’s "beam of light" redeems it with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "ghostwriter" trope through ecological lens—secrets as lily roots. Risk-taking in quiet closure (projected words vs. speech) feels inevitable, avoiding sentimentality with raw fragments like "terrified and brave only for you".</comment>
