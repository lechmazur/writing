<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction (rational forager vs. desperate seeker) drives choices; embodied fear when pocketing the eye shows visceral cost. Hunter’s underdeveloped motivation slightly weakens the climax’s relational stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the creek swallowing the eye crystallizes sacrifice of psychological safety. Causal lens holds perfectly: discovery → upload → confrontation → joint destruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ravine orchard actively constrains choices: mud slows movement, creek enables destruction. Final image (waters swallowing truth) charges closure through setting’s physicality, fulfilling Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from muted psychic echo to weaponized virus; Elara’s agency in uploading data then destroying it narrows options meaningfully. Cost (shattered hope for safety) legible in final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "occlude" shifts from truffle-based coping to burying truth. Final image reweights safety as collective sacrifice, avoiding moralizing despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (truffle forager’s earth-focused POV) modulates under stress. Hunter’s whispered dialogue carries subtext without breaking voice; psychic distance shifts intentionally during confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "storm-soaked earth" and "psychic echo" compress worldbuilding. Slight register drift in "involuntary truth of the sensation" risks abstraction but recovers with concrete creek imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy virus reframed as craving psychological safety, not chaos. Buried architectural plans as weapon (not cure) transforms trope; specificity of Amaranth truffles grounds the premise.</comment>
