<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows Elara’s conflict between foresight and the pilgrim’s void through concrete micro-choices (placing pearl, altered sight), but motivations lack deeper contradictions beyond archetype. Pilgrim’s quest is dramatized via the tear and pearl, yet emotional progression remains slightly abstract in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "Elara finally saw—not with her clairvoyance... but with her own eyes" reconfigures her perception under Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor deduction as the "unseen force" question feels slightly convenient despite lyrical execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choice (path’s shifting resonance) and charges the climax via overlapping shadows on jet wall, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Final image’s "dust motes dancing in the pearl’s light" makes environment indispensable to closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through perception’s reweighting (mundane vs. prophetic visions), narrowing options to sharing rather than seeking. Cost is visible in Elara’s altered sight, but conflict lacks tangible pressure escalation beyond internal shift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: spiderweb/dew images answer "magnify everyday magic" without moralizing. Final line’s "witnesses to the magnificence" offers resonant non-literal closure, avoiding sentimentality while charging the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shimmering threads of potential futures") and rhythmic control elevate tension, though "joyous participant in the world’s simple marvels" slightly overwrites peak emotion. Voice modulates perfectly with pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous cave pearl, perfectly spherical" exemplifies textural specificity. One hairline slip: "joyous participant" edges toward sentimentality in climax, slightly dulling closure’s immediacy without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane magic via oolith and musical crystals avoids tropes, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Emotional specificity in "child’s first successful whistle" elevates familiarity, though core premise lacks radical novelty for 9.0.</comment>
