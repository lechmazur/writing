<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict; "earnestly studious" trait manifests as skill but no contradictory impulses or flaws complicate choices. Epiphany ("carrier wave for time") feels unearned without prior struggle, bordering on diagnostic label-speak despite strong embodied actions like tracing notepad impressions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—dawn's arrival reframes the hum's significance with conceptual cost ("sliver of truth pulled from silent air"). Orientation is clear by 100 words, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven density increase; the "shift" occurs passively rather than through accumulated pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamp's hum functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method and charging the final image. However, the bonsai labyrinth remains atmospheric ornament—its "blooming" detail doesn't pressure choices or alter tactics, narrowly missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing dawn's resonance) tightens via dawn's approach, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; visions happen *to* Elara rather than arising from her choices. Cost is conceptual (ephemerality of captured truth) yet feels unmoored from active trade-offs, weakening pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the notepad's transformation from recorder to "translator," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("dense, beautiful, incomprehensible pattern") offers non-literal answer to time's layered nature. Capped at 8.7 due to Q4's weak escalation limiting thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in stationer's tactile focus ("pages thick with textures"), with rhythm modulating to the hum's fracturing. Minor register drift in "incandescent restraint" slightly disrupts voice, but compression during visions maintains controlled density without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Early template cadence ("She carried... She sought...") slightly dulls momentum, but later prose achieves high density with clean propulsion. No artifacts in closure beat; final line ("descended as the world began to wake") avoids cliché through precise verb choice. Strong but not flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and temporal layering—bonsai scale mirrors time's compression—avoids derivative tropes. Transformation test passed: swapping "bonsai" for generic garden breaks micro-setting logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning distinction within band.</comment>
