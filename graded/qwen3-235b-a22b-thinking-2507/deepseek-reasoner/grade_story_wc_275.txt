<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—dread versus calm action—drive every choice; soldier's embodied fear (ragged breath, white knuckles) shifts credibly to stillness through the dome's pressure. Final renunciation of violence earned by her ritual, with visible cost in his "raw fear" subsiding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: soldier’s "breathing slowing, his eyes clearing" crystallizes the cost of surrendering violence. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (mist, roses, quiet) tightens to reweight "quiet" from emptiness to potential, with the dome’s peace as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Desert rose farm functions as micro-setting that charges the finale: the thorn-stripped bloom’s "tranquil blaze" against dirty armor reconfigures stakes. Every detail (grit crunch, engineered perfumes) filters through Elara’s priorities, constraining her choice to offer a rose, not water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency—her cultivated peace forces the soldier’s sheathing—a single tightening that forecloses violence with visceral cost. Dominant stake (weaving continuity) signaled early, pressure accumulates texturally to the irreplaceable cost of his raw fear yielding to calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: "quiet" sliver reweighted in the finale, rose’s "tranquil blaze" answering "what replaces chaos?" without moralizing. Final line "good harvest" resonates as earned wisdom from thorn-stripped blooms, avoiding binaries by honoring pacifism without redeeming violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures (grit, rose color), avoids skyline. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato under threat ("Elara did not run"), fluid in calm—while compression during crisis ("She saw him then...") maintains voice coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where "tranquil blaze" reprise recharges meaning. Final line "good harvest" distills theme without abstraction. Figurative language sparse but potent ("void where data-streams once buzzed"), with rhythm varying to match pressure—no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes "post-apocalyptic pacifist" trope through specific ritual (bone slivers) and desert roses as active agents. Risk-taking—quiet climax without violence—heightens stakes, with "senselessly perceptive" dread transformed into tangible continuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
