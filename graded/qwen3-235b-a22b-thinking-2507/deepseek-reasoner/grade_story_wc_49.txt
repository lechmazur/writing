<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior causality. No visible cost to character beyond situational resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (alignment passing), but cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence makes the price legible. Causal chain holds though escalation lacks meaningful tightening of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vine tendril functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (conduit for machine) and charges the final luminescence image. Sensory details vivid but "damp earth" cliché slightly generic; environment doesn't constrain tactics beyond plot device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with harvest moon deadline, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the machine succeeds without her adaptation. Cost ("alignment passed") visible but not felt through character choice; pressure tightens only via external timer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restoring sacred practices emerges through vine/song metaphor without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer, but thematic weight leans abstract—lacks concrete cost to Elara that would deepen the "whole again" resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers tingling," "smudges on cheeks") and rhythmic control shine, but stress compression fails under peak pressure—diction remains lyrical when tension should heighten, missing rhythmic shift at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean prose with purposeful variation, but minor scaffold ("gathering hush" → "listening hush") and metaphor repetition ("spinning golden stories") dull closure beat. No loops, yet density slightly overwrought during machine activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk tinkerer with nature mysticism avoids eco-fable clichés through brass-disc mechanics. Bold risk in machine-as-solution, but premise ("ancient magic saves land") remains familiar without transformative moral calculus.</comment>
