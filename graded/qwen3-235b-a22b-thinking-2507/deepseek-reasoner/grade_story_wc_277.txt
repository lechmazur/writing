<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("preserve" vs "discover") powers the arc, but "fundamental, generational sin" uses abstract label-speak without embodied cost during peak discovery. Micro-choice of writing the confession earns closure, though emotional progression lacks visceral layering in the ledger moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory degradation ("solemn playfulness curdled") to Charged Poise closure. Orientation debt (night setting revealed at para 3) costs −0.4, but final image reweights legacy with undeniable conceptual cost through the pen's lightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (rosewood nib) constrains choices—its weight shifts from comfort to accusation to tool—charging the final image. Observatory brasswork/telescope remain postcard details without altering tactics, failing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: archival digging narrows options to confession, with visible cost in legacy collapse. "Orbits of regret" evolves from metaphor to tangible pressure, culminating in the ledger entry's irreversible knowledge shift that reconfigures all prior meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: observatory transforms from "sanctuary" to "monument to falsehood," avoiding moralizing. Final act of writing offers non-literal answer to truth's cost, though "curated falsehood" risks label-speak without deeper sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers found the familiar weight," "hours bled together") modulates under stress. "Solemn playfulness curdled" uses clinical phrasing during crisis, violating the "no therapy-speak" rule and dulling emotional immediacy in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "profound, chilling solemnity" stacks abstract labels without embodied cost in high-pressure discovery. Final line’s "light in her hand" delivers crystalline propulsion, though earlier figurative density risks muddling the ledger reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms legacy trope through specific objects (rosewood nib) and astronomical motif. Emotional truth anchors the fresh angle, though observatory setting leans slightly generic. Bold risk in quiet closure where writing becomes rebellion without tidy resolution.</comment>
