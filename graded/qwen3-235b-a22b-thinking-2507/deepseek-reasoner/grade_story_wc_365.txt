<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "professional curiosity" sharpening to "desperate need," with embodied cost ("mind frayed") earning her final sigil choice. Flaw: minimal physicality under stress beyond "jerked hand back," slightly weakening micro-choices during jumps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: shard discovery → universe jumps → Earned Stasis with visible cost ("profound, simple gravity of failure"). Closure lands via the green sigil—a Resonant Reconfiguration charging the final image with conceptual weight of absorbed regret.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the green glass shard (tool/object) constrains every choice and charges the final sigil. But spaceport details beyond the workbench feel sparse, missing chance to deepen environmental pressure on her search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—redirecting jumps forecloses paths as the shard grows warmer. Cost crystallizes in the man’s "decades" of regret, made visceral by her "frayed" mind. One tightening suffices for length, though moral calculus could deepen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the shard’s journey: shattered → whole → cold → sigil. Final line ("deepest repairs... in silent dockyards of the heart") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo via earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer of the intangible," synesthetic tapestry) modulates under stress—jumps compress syntax to "She focused again, and again." Slight register drift in "profound, simple gravity" but stays character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phantom scent of ozone" to "cold piece of glass" shows through image. Figurative language serves pressure ("graveyard of starship skeletons"), with rhythm accelerating during jumps. Closure image ("green sigil") recharges the shard with perfect density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sci-fi conceit (parallel universes) transformed into emotional archaeology. Shard’s journey avoids trope via specific stakes (a "stupid" lie’s weight), with risk-taking (lyric sci-fi) heightening coherence. Transformation test passed—replace "sensory map maker," story collapses.</comment>
