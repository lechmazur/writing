<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Statue's contradictory impulses (certainty vs. new understanding) act simultaneously during movement; embodied emotion via water/kelp/pearls avoids labels. Final choice earned through prior knowledge of column niche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "tone animate lifeless of the garden shifted"; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern breaks. Thread solution slightly edges toward convenience but statue's prior knowledge salvages causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water pressure and pearls constrain choices and charge final image; micro-setting (column fracture) directly enables closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (e.g., phosphorescent kelp as timer/lullaby).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning of vigil) tightens through revelations; historian's thread action drives irreversible deepening. Cost legible in "weight of water not as burden but blanket" but escalation slightly softens at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image (pearls as constellations) offers resonant answer to "purpose" without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete particulars. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked pearls," "sigh of settling silt"); rhythmic control during revelation cascade. Slight register drift in "chemical memory" momentarily distances POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("sloshed the last breath"). "Three hundred and forty-two" risks unmotivated precision but anchors closure. Final beat's "hummed in harmony" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Underwater city trope transformed through specific mechanics (threading fracture); emotional truth in "statue had always known." Ampoule's foxglove stain provides verifiable freshness without quirk.</comment>
