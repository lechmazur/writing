<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "she had not been wrong to fight, just as they had not been solely monsters"; embodied remorse replaces therapy-speak. Slight backstory summary in para 1 risks over-tidiness but micro-choices (kicking shard, draping mirrors) ground her shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "burnished sorrow... no longer a weight; it was a lens" crystallizes her stance with visible emotional cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift during storm peak, though temporal storm mechanics don't actively constrain final action beyond setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: mirrors directly constrain choice (covering prevents chaos), while the shard's refraction enables glyph reinterpretation. Final image ("shard’s coolness a promise") charges closure through tactile specificity, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redefining civilization's legacy) tightens via shard discovery, but Aris remains off-page antagonist. Cost is felt ("her own revolutionary failure mirrored") though academic dispute lacks tangible consequence beyond internal shift; escalation driven by agency but price stays conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard's evolution: from "mythical" artifact to vessel of collective guilt. Final line reweights "burnished sorrow" into active lens without moralizing, answering central question through concrete action (holding shard as "promise") rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "time... shimmering, auroral curtain" and "dancing stars upon the walls" reflects her poetic lens. Minor register drift in "profound sadness for a path that could not be unchosen" borders on abstraction but rhythm modulates perfectly under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "boil and writhe" and "burnished sorrow" show textural precision. Slight overwriting in "innumerable touches" on shard, but final line’s "last wish of a dead culture" avoids sentimentality through concrete action (holding shard). Peak-beat clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "archaeologist finds truth" trope via remorse-as-redemption angle. "Burnished sorrow" synthesizes temporal physics and emotional archaeology into fresh premise; baroque asteroid setting feels necessary through mirror ritual’s causal role in discovery.</comment>
