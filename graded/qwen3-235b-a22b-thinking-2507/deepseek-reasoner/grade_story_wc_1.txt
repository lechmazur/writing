<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs curiosity) drive every choice; embodied emotion in "scorched testament" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of glass art earned through prior causality with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost: "art would now be one of invisible light" reconfigures purpose while abandoning luminosity. Accumulative lens held impeccably through frost patterns and ledger progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Canyon frost patterns constrain choice (only visible at dawn), furnace reappears as future lens-maker resource. Final image of melting frost charges closure by making the map’s transience thematic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition (frost grooves, ledger marks) narrowing options to one path. Cost legible in her relinquishment of glass art for lens-making, altering tactics immediately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scorched testament" evolution from destruction to preservation. Final image reweights "purpose in pauses" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via concrete action (lenses over glass).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in artist’s noticing ("intricate patterns in morning frost"). Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented sentences during discovery, no head-hopping despite reflective backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silvered with delicate rime" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s "invisible light" crystallizes theme without muddle, propulsion maintained through active verbs like "hum in sympathy".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "knowledge smuggler" trope through frost-based navigation and "invisible light" art. Bold risk in quiet closure where abandonment of craft becomes thematic inevitability.</comment>
