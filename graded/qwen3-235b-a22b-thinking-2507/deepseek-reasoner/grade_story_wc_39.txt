<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: wistful sorrow drives action without diagnostic labels. Final choice (translation over repair) earns closure with visible cost in "gleaned redemption" epiphany. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: single crystalline note joining symphony reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("not fixed the past but gave it new voice"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; cost legible in final paragraph. Orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: salt-crusted music box and glass jars constrain every choice, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy perfectly calibrated—sandpipers' "chittering gossip" vs. foghorn's "resonant groan" reflects urgency. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silenced history) tightens through sound-blending sequence. Pressure escalates via protagonist's agency: dissonant jars force "sweetening" labor. Cost crystallizes in epiphany about "gleaned redemption" foreclosing restoration fantasy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>Theme emerges organically: "lonesome splendor" evolves from wistful artifact to "shared inheritance" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise—translation as intergenerational bridge—avoiding false binaries. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature mastery: poet notices sounds as textures ("percussive thump" of heart). Rhythm modulates from fragmented dawn actions to flowing symphony climax. Zero head-hopping; diction stays within poetic lexicon ("nascent light," "lonesome splendor").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "soft, whispering breath" of grass jars multiple functions. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("pure and perfect, weaving itself") delivers propulsion without muddle. Opening/ending lines anchor voice/stakes with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "translating silence" via sound jars avoids cliché through specific mechanics (foghorn as cello, sandpipers as flute). Emotional truth in valuing imperfect transmission over restoration. No trope echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
