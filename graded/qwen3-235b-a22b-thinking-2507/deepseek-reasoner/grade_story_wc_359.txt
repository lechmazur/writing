<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation and embodied emotion but lacks contradictory impulses; melancholy stated rather than tested through micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance feels earned yet insufficiently conflicted for top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (pillar's transformation), but the wave of perception's abstract nature weakens tangible stakes. Accumulative lens holds, yet cost legibility falters in the "silent force" resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as active micro-setting: its glassy resonance constrains Elara's song and charges the final mandala. Every sensory detail (frozen organ pipes, internal light) evolves with plot pressure, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder as necessity) tightens through Elara's song intensifying the cavern's response, but the cost remains externalized; her personal sacrifice lacks visceral on-page weight despite the pillar's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tangible particulars (colors as emotions, ice-to-mandala shift), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "hush" as "satisfied peace," but the conceptual cost of global transformation feels under-embodied for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cascading ribbons of silver," "sculpted hush") reflects Elara's synesthesia. Rhythmic control escalates with the song's intensity, and purposeful compression (no dialogue) serves the accumulative lens without loss of clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("spear of indigo light," "swirling vortex of auroral light") propels momentum. Minor overwriting in climax ("brilliant, blinding white note") slightly muddles physicality but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of synesthesia and ice resonance feels fresh, but "certify wonder as essential" leans toward thematic echo. Emotional truth elevates trope, yet risk-taking stops short of full conceptual boldness required for 9.0+.</comment>
