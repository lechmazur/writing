<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through mechanic's lens ("calloused hands," "worn smooth lever"), contradictory impulses (practical engineer vs. abstract theorist) culminate in earned renunciation of linear time. Slight underdevelopment of pre-climax tension prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "quiet, absolute certainty settled into her bones" reconfigures time's nature. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density tightens to cadence shift at "She pulled it," with twilight constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass lever (tool) constrains choice (must pull at twilight) and charges final image. "Icy warmth" environment guides perception ("raised goosebumps") and crystallizes in "wings at rest/time in flight" closure, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's rewiring under Accumulative lens; twilight window narrows options to one fleeting moment. Cost unmistakable in "quiet certainty settling into bones," though slightly abstract. Dominant stake (proving temporal coexistence) tightens relentlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ending reweights premise through "wings at rest/time in flight" contrast—a resonant, non-literal answer to time's nature. Theme emerges from hologram layers and Griffin-Moth vision without moralizing; conceptual cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mechanic notices "worn smooth" lever, "mechanically warm hum." Rhythmic control peaks with short sentences at climax ("She pulled it. For a moment..."). Minor abstraction in "subdued awakenings" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("rewiring," "pulsing," "flickered"). Final line recharges wings motif with "time... forever in flight." One abstraction ("profound awakenings") barely touches closure, avoiding severe penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanic proving temporal theory via station's biology. Griffin-Moth vision grounds abstraction; quiet revelation risks sentimentality but earns emotional truth through specific tools. Risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
