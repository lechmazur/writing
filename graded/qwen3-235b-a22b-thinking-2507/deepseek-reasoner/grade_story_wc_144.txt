<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Contradictory impulses (calm focus vs. high-stakes urgency) manifest in micro-choices like requesting water under time pressure. Weakness: Limited internal conflict beyond professional duty; "magnetic calm" slightly abstract without deeper emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands with undeniable cost: the horn's timing ("anchor lifts in three hours") crystallizes the time pressure as Elara's patch succeeds. Causal lens holds perfectly through water-test diagnosis to repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ceramic bowl) directly constrains choice: submerging the drone enables auditory diagnosis. Final image ("speck of purpose against the grey mist") charges closure through atmospheric pressure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency under causal lens: time pressure narrows options to the water test, then the wire patch. Cost is visceral via the horn's timing and her intense focus, reweighting the dominant stake decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "patch, not rewrite" philosophy embodies perception beyond sight. Final image ("decoded song leading the way") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though thematic complexity could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("map of sound and pressure") modulates perfectly under pressure; rhythmic control in "her hands flew" sequence. Zero filter verbs or register drift despite high-stakes focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("heartbeat of warmth in the cavernous, cold iron belly" does triple duty). Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Minor abstraction in "magnetic calm" redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "blind savant" trope through specific mechanics (water refraction diagnosis). Fresh synthesis: blindness as superior perception for auditory decoding feels inevitable, though risk-taking stays within bounds.</comment>
