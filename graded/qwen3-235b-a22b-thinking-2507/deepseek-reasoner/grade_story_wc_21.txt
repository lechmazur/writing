<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's embodied trauma (ghost-smoke sensation) and contradictory scholarly urgency vs ethical caution drive choices; micro-choices arranging debris reveal hierarchy of truth over safety with visible cost at lagoon's edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: sentinel's dissipation reconfigures options when Elias writes "YOUR TRUTH IS SAFE" with felt cost in "sacred covenant" duty shift; Causal lens holds via diary decryption triggering retrocognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon's non-reflective property charges final image—showing past strategy not death—and constrains Elias's beach debris dialogue, transforming setting from obstacle to truth-revealer under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when phantom sentinel halts at first message; Elias's agency in crafting debris dialogue narrows options to parley, with cost legible in "ghost-sensation of smoke" foreclosing naive historical recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "I KNOW WHAT THEY TOOK FROM YOU" reweights "truth vs myth" without moralizing; final image of zeppelin carrying "searing truth" answers central question through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("ozone," "sun-bleached driftwood"); compression during retrocognition ("world dissolved") taught early pays off in closure's sparse shell-message cadence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "searing reverie" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in embodied smoke sensation, but "quiet victory wrested" slightly overwrites final propulsion despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as active parley with trauma; risk-taking (retrocognition as embodied trap) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming "obsidian lagoon" from cliché to tactical constraint.</comment>
