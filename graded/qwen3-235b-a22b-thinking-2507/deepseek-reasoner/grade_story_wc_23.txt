<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "raw solace that was both gift and torment" and embodied emotion via bronze's "familiar comfort." Final choice earned by prior causality with felt cost: stranded but no longer lost. Avoids therapy-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "still stranded, but no longer lost" crystallizes reconfigured options with conceptual cost (drowned past as chartable void). Accumulative lens holds; density increase in pendulum scene reweights stake. Cost proof: "geography of loss finally had a true north" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Starlit station constrains choices (hydraulic failure, moon alignment) and charges closure via lunar pendulum. Micro-setting bronze censer foot directly enables the build action. Sensory hierarchy—tactile bronze, visual moonlight—reflects urgency while avoiding symbolism. "Silent, expanding bog" mirrors internal state through perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (antenna realignment) tightens through moon-phase constraint and hydraulic failure. Escalation driven by agency: "build a new way" crystallizes stance. Cost is palpable—"physical ache" of emptiness—made legible in final image. Single deepening (transcending hydraulics) suffices for length; coincidence (call) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "charting the void they left behind" reweights loss without moralizing. Final image—"geography of loss finally had a true north"—offers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo; complexity embraces "shape of loss itself" without false equivalence. No abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "mind a quilt of dead-reckoning" filters world through navigation. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during frantic build—"braided copper wire, its tip a spent cartridge casing." Elision (voice's origin) taught early and paid off in closure tone. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion: "She wouldn't fix... she would transcend it." Figurative language ("mind a quilt") serves Accumulative lens without muddle. Final line’s cadence shift ("guided by a voice... weight of all that was gone") recharges motif. Minor register drift in "telluric currents" (-0.1) doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific "geography of loss" angle. Emotional truth in "raw solace" avoids templates. Fresh synthesis: bronze censer foot (prayer vessel) repurposed as pendulum foundation. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "reverse migration" feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
