<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the shift from technical analysis to embodied empathy ("it was not the tool, but he himself"). Motivation intensifies through micro-choices like pressing his palm to the wound, though flaw depth (over-reliance on tools) lacks fuller exploration beyond initial frustration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the fragile "intensely quiet crescendo" crystallizes reborn music with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: pressure builds via sensory density (cracks as score → ghost vibration), though the hedgehog timeframe doesn't tighten tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator charges the final image ("simple tool in hand"), and petrified bark constrains Aris's actions. Strong professional perception ("percussive drip of sap") but no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond the immediate strumming act, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through one meaningful intensification: the shift from analyzing cracks to becoming the conduit. Cost is legible in "the world had forgotten: understanding"—conceptual price of fragile reconnection—but the hedgehog timeframe misses escalation opportunities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "he had not forced the music; he had simply listened" offers resonant non-literal answer to silence's cost. Zero moralizing; final image reweights "empathy in motion" through concrete action without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("didn't hear notes, but entire movements") modulates rhythm masterfully—from languid stillness to staccato "A single, pure note." Minor filter-verb use ("he let his breath slow") is voice-motivated and unobtrusive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver thread of sound weaving through the gray grove" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("cathedral of stillness"), though "lighter than a moth's wing" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "tree-song sculptor" trope transformed via porcelain insulator's resonant physics. Emotional specificity avoids abstraction ("ghost of vibration, a plea"), though hedgehog timeframe feels slightly derivative despite thematic integration.</comment>
