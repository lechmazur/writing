<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her solitary quest versus inherited connection; micro-choice of hairpin reveals hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in epiphany ("dawning hush now complete") risks diagnostic label-speak but earns closure through concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: journal revelation reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("profound faith, not solitude"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—light observations tighten pressure toward the violet beam’s discovery. Orientation clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral window actively constrains discovery (light angles dictate timing); amber pavilion evolves from setting to active motif in final choice. Micro-setting details (hairpin, worn flagstone) charge closure. Meets 9+ gate via environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s daily observations under Accumulative lens; violet beam tightens options to "investigate or ignore." Conceptual cost legible in shifted worldview, but pressure buildup lacks one visceral narrowing moment before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: flowers’ "silent pact with hidden world" reweights solitude as faith. Final mural plan offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Journal entry avoids thematic echo by grounding insight in concrete moth-pollinator biology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("angel’s eye was a tiny, flawed bubble") with rhythmic control during discovery scene. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via pigment-stained hands motif. Slight register drift in "umbral tenderness" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spectral violet onto the stone floor" crystallizes momentum. Minor overwriting in "slow and sodden thaw" dilutes tension, but final line’s "tribute in gold and violet for the moths" achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms trope via etched glass as "map of light" and moths as unseen pollinators. Emotional specificity in "loneliness of her work" avoids generic quest. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
