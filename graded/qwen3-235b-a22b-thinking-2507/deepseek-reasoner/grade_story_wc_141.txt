<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in synthesis of grandfather’s cosmic search and father’s intimate craftsmanship; final choice to play feels earned through memory-triggered micro-choices. Epiphany edges toward rapid resolution but avoids diagnostic label-speak via embodied hum-in-bones imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: compass fading signifies ephemeral truth internalized. Orientation clear by 120 words; accumulative lens holds through hum’s intensification. Memory transition ("world shifted") lacks concrete trigger, slightly weakening escalation causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned observatory’s dome acoustics and half-finished cello actively constrain choices—dust motes, grit, and skeletal architecture charge the final image. Micro-setting as essential tool: cello’s unfinished state necessitates her completion, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: touch triggers hum, shell-focus crystallizes stance. Cost legible in compass fading (ephemeral truth internalized). Grandfather/father debate over-explains stakes, diluting pressure’s organic accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "music in the space between" crystallizes via cello-string vibration, not moralizing. Final image of raw note joining hum offers resonant, non-literal answer to riddle. Zero thematic echo; ambiguity embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gloomy cheerfulness," "bruised twilight") modulates perfectly with pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from flowing reflection to staccato action ("boots scuffing," "bow frayed"). Slight lexicon drift in "reimagines past conversations" momentarily distances POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dust motes danced in last slivers of light" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "whisper of the old one’s close" recharges opening motif flawlessly. Minor cadence stumble: "resonant hums... providing the bass note" slightly disrupts flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "cosmic music" trope through specific objects (child-painted shell, ephemeral compass) and cello’s literal/figurative duality. Emotional synthesis of science/art feels fresh; avoids safety middle by embracing ambiguity as active choice ("play along").</comment>
