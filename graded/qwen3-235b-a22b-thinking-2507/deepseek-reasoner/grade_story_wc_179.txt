<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion (Kael's "hardened knot of resentment") and contradictory impulses (clinging vs release) drive the pivotal cylinder-handoff beat. Slight abstraction in "teach resentment to release" motivation prevents 9+; cellular memory concept borders on diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by physical jolt reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael's released breath crystallizes stance crystallization with visible cost ("fight drained from shoulders"). Orientation clear by 100 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation. Cost proof evident in "fractured piece was enough to remind his cells of wholeness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (music box cylinder) constrains the climax: broken pin causes dissonance that directly triggers Kael's emotional reversal. Library's "soundless sanctuary" pressure enables the quiet confrontation, and nebula window evolves causally with the shift, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening via deepening: cylinder's dissonance intensifies Kael's resentment before release, narrowing options to acceptance. Escalation driven by Elara's agency ("tapped his chest") under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in his "weary acceptance" foreclosing rigid resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through Kael's cellular memory reaction and the final image ("shift felt less like ending"). Avoids moralizing; "shifting grace" concept reweights prior pain through embodied experience. Final line offers resonant answer without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stones groaning as physics softened like wax") reflects Elara's scheming nature. Dialogue carries subtext ("child's toy" vs "map") with intentional indirection. Minor register drift in "cellular memory" phrasing barely avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; exceptional density ("reality shifts, the very stones... groaning as physics softened like wax" does triple duty). Slight figurative muddle in "bypassing conscious resistance" redeemed by immediate physical jolt. Final line recharges dust mote motif with perfect cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "broken object" trope via specific mechanics (reappearing pin, cellular memory). "Shifting grace" angle on reality shifts feels fresh through Kael's physicality. Risk-taking heightens stakes but stops short of 9+ distinction; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
