<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied professionalism shines through micro-choices (tone bar precision), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her flawless execution feels slightly idealized without visible struggle against grief or doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Arthur’s death crystallizes love’s transcendence with visceral cost ("chest still"), sustained under Accumulative lens where sensory density (scent, music) reweights mortality without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vinyl shard constrains Elara’s method (no turntable), charges the final image ("memory now complete"), and the hospice’s cloud-filtered light mirrors Arthur’s transition, fulfilling the 9+ gate for setting-as-tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory deepening (ozone scent to gardenia perfume) narrows options to Elara’s improvised music, with Arthur’s life as felt cost; agency-driven under Accumulative lens though time pressure lacks visceral tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard’s reprise: "hymning the mundane" rejects grandeur for love’s worn authenticity, with the final image reweighting "broken thing to make something whole" as a resonant, non-literal answer to mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s perceptual signature ("clean, sharp aroma of ozone") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, though "serene hospice music therapist" description edges toward label; no POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ghostly and warped" note implies memory) with clear propulsion, though "pulsing stillness" repetition slightly muddles the final beat’s clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes through the vinyl shard’s specific logic—love as fragmented, tactile sound—not abstraction; the "broken to whole" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
