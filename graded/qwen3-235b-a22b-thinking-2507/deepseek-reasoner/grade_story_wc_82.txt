<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in clumsy paper folding vs. skilled glasswork, embodying grief's duality. Micro-choice to "transform not fold" compels higher stakes through tangible craft. Avoids therapy-speak; embodied sorrow in "lopsided, pathetic" cranes. Slight over-articulation in "she would transform it" costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing: luminous crane's ascent reweights grief as sacred monument with visceral cost ("weight of sorrow leaving"). Causal lens holds perfectly—gem polishing enables light transformation. Orientation anchors in 38 words; cost proof in "spirit descend while ascending" crystallizes stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: flawed amber's polishing dictates light diffusion quality, charging final image. Island's gravitational dance mirrors emotional state, not mere backdrop. Sensory specificity ("ozone and jasmine") filtered through lantern-maker's priorities. No static description; every detail pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief transformation) tightens via gem-polishing mechanics and island's descent/ascension. Agency drives escalation: shifting from paper to light reconfigures options. Cost is visceral in "luminous torment" of the crane's beauty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete craft: "stained-glass beautiful" memory becomes non-literal answer to grief. No moralizing; final crane image reweights "luminous torment" as sacred release. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in amber's glow and glass architecture. Earned wisdom through "monument" realization, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "fingers stained with pigment," "subtle geometries of light" reflect lantern-maker's POV. Rhythm modulates under pressure—"The work consumed her" compresses time organically. Slight repetition of "luminous torment" (beat 3 vs. 8) costs 0.2; otherwise flawless voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("She blew the glass... her breath giving shape to pain"). Final paragraph's cadence ("circled... ascended... felt her spirit descend while ascending") achieves rhythmic perfection. Minor density in "central floating isle" description costs 0.1; no figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via specific craft logic: gem polishing affects light diffusion, origami failure necessitates 3D solution. "Radiant crane" avoids cliché by being tangible light, not ghost. Fresh synthesis of lantern-making physics and emotional release feels inevitable. Risk-taking in luminous embodiment heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
