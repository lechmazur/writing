<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bleak exhilaration" and hunger stone reinterpretation, but motivation ("step beyond fate's design") remains slightly abstract without deeper personal stakes. Final choice earned though conceptual cost lacks visceral punch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "slow exhale of low tide" transforms from ending to "pause before an inward breath" with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density build to radiance reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: hunger stone exposure pressures tactics, lighthouse becomes machine, yoyo's "concentric patterns" constrain choices. Tide functions as live clock altering Elias' actions, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through "groan of protesting physics" to "terrible and beautiful potential" of radiance. Agency clear in assembly, cost legible in "might-have-beens" with conceptual weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (yoyo reverse-engineering = alternative paths). Final image reweights hunger stone's "sentence" into "statistic" without moralizing, embracing complexity of "terrible and beautiful potential".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "joy sharp and lonely as shard of glass" and "air humming with pressure that had no sound." Rhythmic control under pressure flawless, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "latent radiance" passage achieves high density: "not a light that shone upon something, but a light that was something" shows purposeful variation. Minor cliché ("frantic slash") saved by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through yoyo-orrery mechanics. Emotional truth in "bleak exhilaration" avoids generic ambition. Final reconfiguration of hunger stone feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
