<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices: fingers tracing carvings reverse her thinking, rejecting "fortress of fact" for invitation. No label-speak; epiphany earned through stick’s physicality. "Uncommonly serene" repetition slightly mannered but doesn’t undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Conceptual Repricing: "reverse the expectation of a single truth" with visible cost (abandoned defense for complicit audience). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to epiphany. Meteor hush reweights silence from empty to "full of echo," charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radar dome’s "meteor hush" constrains the epiphany, transforming silence from affront to sacred space. Stick’s texture and weight drive the reversal; final image’s "echo of a story" recharges dome’s emptiness. Micro-setting (stick as tool) charges closure irreducibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when stick reversal crystallizes her ethical shift: "not to present clean truth, but create space." Cost is visible in abandoned anger and strategic pivot to pamphlets. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, though dome’s pressure could deepen tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stick’s reprise: "give readers the story stick" avoids moralizing while reweighting ethical storytelling. Final image’s "echo of a story yet to be told" resonates non-literally—truth as communal act, not artifact. No thematic echo; complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is calligrapher-specific: "give of paper," "drag of a nib," "deliberate flow of ink." Rhythm modulates from "bruised twilight" to epiphany’s "half-lit flickering." No head-hopping; compression (puppet show reflection) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush" avoids cliché via concrete charge. Final line’s "echo of a story" crystallizes theme without overwriting. Slight register drift in "uncommonly serene grip" but no closure impact—prose remains taut, image-driven, with strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ethical storytelling reframed as audience complicity, not artist purity. Radar dome and story stick transform tropes—Cold War relic becomes truth-telling vessel. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity (puppet shows, woodcuts) avoids abstraction.</comment>
