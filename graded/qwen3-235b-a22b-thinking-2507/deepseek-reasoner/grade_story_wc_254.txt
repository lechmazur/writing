<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("cold sting of the cell" textures), micro-choices under pressure authentic. Lacks relationship crucible as no second character present; single-POV baseline fully satisfied with contradictory impulses (exile pain vs stone's patience) crystallizing in purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolved boundaries = sacred act), Accumulative/Textural lens held consistently. Minor escalation flaw: "tremor of certainty" lacks sufficient causal weight as turning point despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (palms on quartz) and charges final image (page as "dark leaf"). Sensory hierarchy masterful: geological vibration ("hum clarifies into complex chord") filters through poet's bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic freedom vs rigid boundaries) tightens through protagonist's agency (touching quartz), with felt cost in dissolved self/stone boundaries. Escalation driven by Accumulative lens: density increase in sensory data reweights "sacred barriers" concept with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("paraphrase of stone’s song"), not moralizing. Final image reweights premise: "sacredness found not in upholding barriers, but in... dissolution" offers resonant non-literal answer without stated moral, avoiding thematic echo flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cloud-shadow poet" lens) with rhythmic control under pressure ("air holds a lantern-moth hush"). Elision of external world taught early; psychic distance shifts intentionally during quartz immersion, modulating voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("shock, not of pain but of pure frequency" compresses sensation). Minor register drift in "pure information" slightly abstracts peak beat, but rhythm variation ("violet in twilight") maintains propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through geologic metaphor ("pressure creates light"). Fresh inflection: boundaries dissolving as sacred act feels inevitable in hindsight. Avoids abstraction via specific, verifiable details ("rough texture of suppression order"), resisting derivative premise.</comment>
