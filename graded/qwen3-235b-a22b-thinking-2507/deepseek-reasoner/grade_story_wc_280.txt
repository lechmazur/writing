<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (eternal repetition vs connection) manifest concretely in her coin-drawing gesture; Leo's micro-choice—hand placement without taking—reveals hierarchy of values through embodied action, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Elara's dissolution via "grateful release" smelling of "rain-washed petals" crystallizes the stakes, with the solidified coin embodying the earned reconfiguration of her fractured timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tarot coin constrains every choice—from Elara's initial draw to Leo's non-grasping touch—and charges the final image ("cool and solid in his palm"), transforming from unused prop to symbol of completed story with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through sensory echoes (music → rope → rigging failure) narrows options under Accumulative/Textural lens; Leo's agency in anchoring timelines with his hand creates irreversible cost—Elara's dissolution—felt through synesthetic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "encore not in applause but in connection" avoids moralizing by crystallizing in Leo's hand-over-coin gesture, with the final coin image reweighting the entire premise through earned sensory resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in synesthetic translations ("crunch of gravel tasted stale bread"), but "synesthetically blessed" momentarily drifts into clinical diction before immersion in Leo's sensory POV restores consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "he saw the coin, The Fool facing up, where it had fallen" achieve high density by merging action, symbol, and stakes without figurative muddle even in peak rigging-failure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost trope transformed through synesthesia-as-connection mechanism; the tarot coin's unused-prop-to-solid-relic arc feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking (sensory ghost lore) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
