<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elvan's reticence and observational nature drive credible choices; embodied emotion ("chill that had nothing to do with sea wind") and micro-choices (scanning periphery) reveal contradiction between solitude and duty. Limited internal conflict during action phase prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("The wick is spent. I am fading") under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by para 1; ghost's fading and ship danger make cost legible. Slight convenience in "read the letters" note prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sea glass and cairn function as micro-setting that constrains choices (Elvan deciphers stone message) and charges final image. Sensory details ("moaning wind," "rain-slicked dock") reflect urgency without checklist. Occupational detail light but sufficient for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (ship safety) tighten through letter revelations under Accumulative lens; Elvan's agency in relighting lamp creates visible cost (ghost's fading). Pressure intensifies via density shift in logbook entries. One decisive deepening fully sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "bottling safety" emerges through sea glass/cairns without moralizing; final cairn reweights "luminescent ache" into earned protection. Closure image answers central question non-literally. No thematic echo despite poetic language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant," salt-spray world) with rhythmic control during crisis. Slight register drift in "spectral hand" phrasing undercuts voice purity. No dialogue present; psychic distance shifts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cold, dead eye" metaphor consistent through climax. Final line ("silent friend to the voice in the glass") recharges sea glass motif with propulsion. Figurative language sparse but precise in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via textual accumulation (letters) and stone cairns; emotional specificity in "bottling safety" avoids cliché. Sea glass system feels organic, not checklist. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
