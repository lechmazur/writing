<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (protecting artist vs. community expectations) crystallize in the climax with visible cost ("weight of trust"), though "boldly sympathetic" trait leans toward label over embodied demonstration in middle beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "light holding the gentle, persistent ache"; Accumulative lens holds through patterned clue accumulation (clay smear, broken reed) tightening options toward the weaving decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reed medium constrains the pivotal solution (sculpture on obsidian arbor), charging the final image; crystalline orchard's static role slightly limits pressure on choices despite vivid texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency when Elara chooses creation over exposure, reweighting "belonging" with felt cost; communal search mechanics lack specific pressure on mid-beat tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (weaving collaboration), not statement; final image reweights "grafted self" with emotional cost, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss with "webs of kinship" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminescent moss," "hum felt more than heard") modulates under pressure, though "boldly sympathetic" intrudes as authorial label disrupting voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; peak-beat density ("sculpture glowed, a testament...") avoids figurative muddle while advancing stakes; "singular, desperate need" slightly edges toward label but not in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "street artist" trope through reed medium and communal context; risk-taking heightens stakes but "grafted self" metaphor lacks total inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
