<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in face-blindness ("places held more memory than people") drives concrete choices, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; closure earned through visible cost of watching the projection fade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("left only the plain, aged wood behind"); causal lens holds perfectly from coin discovery to acceptance of limits; orientation anchored by line 15 with functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree trunk library functions as active micro-setting: condemned status creates time pressure, oculus enables lens, and "plain aged wood" finale charges closure; environment constrains every choice from search to crafting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: coin discovery tightens options, lens crafting raises stakes, projection failure forces renunciation; cost unmistakable in "beautiful, heartbreaking limit" realization and fading sky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through projection's failure: final image of "uncapturable blue" reweights the quest without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in concrete particulars of the lens straining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractally precise" touch, dust-moted light) modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "fractally precise" repetitions slightly jars voice consistency during high-stakes crafting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("fracturing," "coalesced"); single hairline slip: "fractally precise" appears 3x without deepening context in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "ephemeral beauty" trope through specific constraints (face-blind artist, tree library); risk-taking in lyric precision heightens stakes without gimmickry; fresh angle treating sky-capture as physical craft.</comment>
