<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "brazen calm" manifests in precise wire-wrapping micro-choices under mortal pressure. Contradictory impulses (systematics vs. wild plan) fuse in the copper circlet act, earning her peaceful demise with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "She did not have six months; the endeavor had taken the last of her." Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density (deep water pressure, branch grooves) tightens into irreversible connection, foreclosing her path with embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Living stone pillars function as active micro-setting, constraining Elara’s tactics (copper conduit) and charging the final image (oaks embracing wires). Sensory details like "copper cool against her temples" filter through her botanical expertise, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interspecies respect) escalates through protagonist agency: wiring sequence narrows options as strength fades. Cost is visceral—"tidal pull on her dwindling strength"—culminating in her life as the price, reweighting the orchard’s final state under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: copper wires woven into living branches reprice "remodel" as symbiotic integration. Avoids moralizing; final image ("humming through stone and sap and copper") resonates as non-literal answer to coexistence without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: botanical precision ("soil compositions, grafting techniques") modulates into lyrical compression during connection ("slow, immense pressure in her mind"). Psychic distance shifts intentionally as copper circlet activates, sustaining voice under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("glinting metallic vines," "perennial thoughts") propels momentum. Final line’s rhythmic cadence ("stone and sap and copper") avoids figurative muddle, with "tenderly grown" offering textural specificity that charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "dying legacy" trope via specific method (copper wiring) and organic payoff (oaks embracing wires). Emotional truth in her calm precision avoids generic heroism; synthesis feels inevitable when branches integrate the human-made, resisting abstraction.</comment>
