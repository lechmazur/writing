<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fighting disquiet vs understanding it) embodied in micro-choices like waiting attentively; the pendant's rejection earns closure with visible cost in the fraying boundary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the boundary's flare and solidification reconfigure displacement as connection with conceptual cost; accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the throw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains every choice—muffled sound forcing attentive stillness, gravel path becoming celestial mosaic—and the pendant's corrosive cold directly charges the final image of solidified walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (stability vs decay) tighten through the boundary's fraying; Elara's agency in hurling the pendant narrows options with felt cost (the library's fragility), driving escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the boundary's reconfiguration: "homesickness was a connection" crystallized by the solidified library, avoiding moralizing while reweighting displacement as resonant empathy without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("temporary ghost in perpetual mist") with rhythmic control; misty lucidity modulates voice under pressure, though "dimensionally homesick" slightly strains lexicon in one peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sheath of glittering ice," "luminescent skin") with clear propulsion, though "dimensionally homesick" risks conceptual abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "homesick for stability" as cosmic fragility; risk-taking (lyric dream logic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with the boundary's fraying making emotional truth specific and indispensable.</comment>
