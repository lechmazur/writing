<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dread-tinged thrill vs. trying to clamp laughter) drive the climax. Final realization earned through wick's transformation and ship's survival, with visible cost in altered worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "laughter was not a curse, but a compass" crystallizes stance with felt cost (wick's change, redefined purpose). Hybrid lens holds through causal storm escalation and textural shadow reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse shadow actively constrains choice, creating the safe channel. Final image of glass wick's "steady, enduring glow" charges closure through micro-setting evolution from obstacle to symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Silas' agency (trimming wick, fighting laughter) under hybrid lens. Cost legible in wick's transformation and shifted understanding: "old ways giving way" forecloses previous role with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shadow/light duality; final image of glass wick reweights "ancient shadows" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing wisdom via action: steering into darkness saves the ship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadowed elation," "crystallized wick") with rhythmic control during storm. Minor register drift in "transmuted into a slender rod" slightly disrupts voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "waves like black mountains" avoids cliché through context. One borderline ornate phrase ("a silent omen he did not understand") in low-pressure beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope via prophetic laughter and shadow navigation. Risk-taking (laughter as salvation signal) heightens stakes coherently; specificity ("print newspaper relic") avoids genericity.</comment>
