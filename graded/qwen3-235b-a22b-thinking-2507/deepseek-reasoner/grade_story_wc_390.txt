<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; competence feels unearned without struggle. "Logically emotional" trait stated but not dramatized as trade-off in choices. Final endurance earned but journey misses irrational layer crucial for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visceral cost: "chest heaving" and surrendered sunset crystallize transience. Causal lens holds perfectly—ship's thrum necessitates counter-wave, which demands precise tuning. Persistent time constraint shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crypt keeper's key charges final image ("key still in hand" post-victory). Ice floes actively pressure choices—grinding creates sonic problem Elara must solve. Micro-setting (lens rings) constrains action via "hair's breadth" adjustments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by agency: ship's crescendo forces final ring adjustment, foreclosing confrontation. Cost unmistakable—physical ("chest heaving"), temporal (sunset surrender), and conceptual (artifact's song transformed). One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image reweights theme: "no longer just keeper; part of song" avoids moralizing. Subtext in gesture—key used for tuning, not locking. Sunset shift from threat to serene light earns resonance, but secondary thematic depth limited by scope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: engineer's precision ("harmonic offsets") blends with poetic observation ("mournful symphony"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress—long setup sentences fracture into clipped crisis phrases. Pattern taught early, paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("teeth worn smooth by generations" implies history in 7 words). Final line recharges opening motif. Minor scaffold in setup ("mission was logically emotional... defied cold reason") slightly tells but justified by theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic physics as emotional defense avoids magic-system clichés. Transformation test fails if "sonic absolution" swapped for generic magic—specificity is essential. Bold risk elevates stakes through technical precision, not violence.</comment>
