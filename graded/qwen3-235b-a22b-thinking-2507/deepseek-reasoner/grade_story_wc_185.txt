<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hammered repose" masking deep anxiety; micro-choices (whispering into ice) reveal hierarchy of values as stone responds. No therapy-speak—embodied emotion in "vibrated in the teeth" and "fragile needle stitching through noise" grounds the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the bloom’s expansion forecloses destruction (cost: hum pacified, not erased), with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding via density escalation in ice resonance. Orientation anchors ("harmonic caves," "Mapkeeper") by word 20, avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ice crack patterns) constrains choice—her method hinges on examining fractures—and charges closure as "silver constellation." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: crisis narrows to ice’s "frosted web," then expands as silence blooms, avoiding symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: examining ice patterns (beat 1) → whispering (beat 2) → resonance (beat 3) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is undeniable—the hum becomes "respectful bass note," not gone—reweighting stakes via the bloom’s pacification, not annihilation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: the bloom’s "weaving absence" reweights "storm vs quiet" into interdependence. Final image ("keeper of equilibrium") answers the central question without moralizing; no thematic echo—realization arises from the stone’s pulse, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "ripple-marked face" noticing pressure in ice fractures, "static hum that vibrated in the teeth." Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato during struggle ("she persisted"), fluid at resolution—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "fragile needle stitching through noise" (action + metaphor + stakes). Figurative language serves pressure: "bloom of hush" crystallizes concept without muddle. Minor deduction: "profound peace" slightly abstracts in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "silence vs noise" trope via specific mechanics: ice patterns as resonant amplifier, silence as active "weaving." Risk-taking (making quiet a living force) heightens stakes—energy beings harmonized, not defeated—without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
