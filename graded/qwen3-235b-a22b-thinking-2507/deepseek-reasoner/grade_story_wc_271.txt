<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied trauma specificity excels: jaw tension, flinching shoulders, and bark-focused micro-choice reveal contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Final acceptance of the photo as "evidence" earns visible cost through somatic reclamation, though minor room for deeper internal conflict in the endurance moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "planting" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("joy had existed... could exist again"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; cost proof is irrefutable in the photo's reweighting from "cruel joke" to "evidence" amid the sea cliff setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arboretum functions as essential micro-setting: pine bark texture actively constrains choice during panic ("traced a specific groove") and charges the final image ("wind-sculpted trees"). Salt scent and wave sounds evolve from sensory details to tactical tools against trauma, meeting the 9+ gate through concrete pressure on her stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by somatic agency under Accumulative lens: jet sound triggers neural pathway cascade narrowing her world to terror, resolved only through embodied choice. Cost is unmistakable in "iron bands around ribs loosening" and redefined relationship with the photograph, with no convenience or coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "anchor optimism in realism" through concrete action—gardening and photo ritual—not abstraction. Final "planting" image offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, though "realism" label in setup slightly risks thematic echo, avoiding full 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: stress compresses diction ("all she could do was freeze") while calm expands sensory detail ("rough, yet sun-warmed"). Minor deduction for "somatic markers" phrasing bordering clinical register in peak beat, but voice modulation under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm masterfully mirrors panic-to-calm transition. "Map of tension written through somatic markers" risks clinical tone but is redeemed by immediate physical demonstration. Final line "planting" achieves earned simplicity with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms PTSD tropes through arboretum-specific somatic anchoring and refusal of facile optimism. Emotional truth in "joy had existed... could exist again" avoids generic templates, though drone strike survivor premise lacks fresh angle despite stellar execution.</comment>
