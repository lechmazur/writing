<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in translator’s tactile precision (“kindly methodical” tracing) and embodied failure (“hollow pressure in ears”). Contradictory impulses (arrogance vs. humility) crystallize in seed-planting choice, but epiphany lacks incremental struggle; realization feels slightly accelerated for high-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: ambition “quiet, replaced by quiet, determined hope” reconfigures stakes with visible cost (abandoned decade of work). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory decay (“ozone,” “cracked soil”) to final image where cost (“touching distance from grace”) is legible on final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (planting in intact soil-bed) and charges closure (“tiny vessel of potential”). Magnetic arbor’s shattered pathways mirror internal state without overt symbolism; sensory hierarchy (ozone over scentless air) reflects translator’s observational bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition physics) tightens through protagonist’s analogical realization, foreclosing forced capture for nurtured growth. Cost—abandoned ambition becoming “ash in mouth”—charges final image. Escalation driven by agency (reinterpreting equations), but pressure buildup lacks one tangible mid-scene trade-off to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete shift: cuneiform’s “slow growth” vs. fruit’s “violent transition” reweights “physics of transition” into organic metaphor. Final image (“suspended between earth and infinite blue”) answers central question without moralizing; ambiguity in “quiet hope” avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“cuneiform translator” noticing angular script, analogical thinking) modulates under stress: prose compresses during rupture (“frantic energy”) yet retains rhythmic control. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as realization dawns (“He must reestablish...”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“electric tang of a presence now departed” does triple duty). Figurative language sparse but purposeful (“ambition... haunted by ghost of what it almost was”). Final line’s cadence (“met with patience, in their own time”) resolves with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform translation with theoretical physics avoids trope; “knowledge fruit” as cognition tool transforms redemption arc. Emotional specificity in “fractured clay tablet” analogies elevates beyond generic failure-to-wisdom. Lacks one bold structural risk to breach 9.0.</comment>
