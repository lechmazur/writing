<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("preserve unspoken words") compellingly drives silent acknowledgment climax; embodied contradiction in "tranquilly perceptive" observer becoming active preserver. Minor flaw: emotional progression slightly abstract in peak beat ("gratitude... sorrow... hope" lacks visceral sensation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: box reforming and ghosts fading crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("weight... now part of him"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned deepening of covenant imagery; cost legible in final image without declaration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned apiary micro-setting constrains every choice—bees swarm specific air patch, box placed where sand is "gritty under knees," colored light reconfigures wasteland. Final image charges closure via oasis as "graveyard of industry" transformed by light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling covenant) tightens meaningfully when ghost-woman appears, narrowing options to silent acknowledgment. Cost ("weight now part of him") is felt but abstract; escalation lacks tangible trade-off (e.g., physical exhaustion or resource loss) to elevate to 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "tangled covenant" shifts from broken glass to seamless whole, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("tranquil silence... finally eloquent") resonates non-literally as answer to "unspoken words" premise without stating wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("honey-thick unspoken words," "sun-bleached sand") modulates under pressure; syntax compresses to fragments during climax ("He knew what he had to do"). Zero head-hopping; focalization stays locked in Silas’s quiet observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "colored light... set dead earth ablaze" shows with textural specificity. Minor flaw: "gratitude for labor, sorrow for loss" in climax risks abstraction but saved by immediate physical anchoring ("sand gritty under knees").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via beekeeping lens—"tangled covenant" as stained glass reframes symbiosis. Risk-taking (silent climax) heightens stakes, but "ghosts of bees" slightly echoes familiar magical realism without sufficient fresh inflection to breach 9.0.</comment>
