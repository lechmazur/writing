<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "cartography of scars" manifests through embodied choices (reading brother's poem, voice woven into storm). Contradictory impulses (compliance vs witness) crystallize in the "rarefy" realization. Lacks one visceral physical detail during peak stress to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the released poem as "scar upon flawless skin" reconfigures truth's role. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through storm imagery culminating in the ventilation shaft release. Minor convenience in timer's reset timing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory and darkroom timer constrain choices (15-minute window, wind carrying poem). Storm shifts from backdrop to active participant—lightning enables reading, gale disseminates words. Final image ("scar upon flawless skin") charges closure through micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth preservation vs dissemination) tightens when "preservation is not enough" realization reframes her agency. Escalation driven purely by protagonist's insight under accumulative lens; cost is irreversible release into danger. No redundant moves—every beat deepens the central pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scar" motif reweighted in closure: truth as wound, not balm. Avoids moralizing by making the poem’s release a "scar upon flawless skin"—a resonant, non-literal answer to censorship. Brother’s vanished presence deepens complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") filters all description. Minor register drift in "ozone scent" (slightly clinical) disrupts voice cohesion during peak tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with storm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cartography of scars" repetition functions as intentional motif. High density ("voice a frail but steady thread woven into roaring tapestry") propels momentum. One borderline purple phrase ("seed cast onto fertile lightning") prevents 9.0 but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms censorship trope through "rarefy" as alchemical action and observatory-as-laboratory framing. Emotional specificity ("mask of compliant anonymity felt thin") avoids generic rebellion. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry—release hinges on prior particulars.</comment>
