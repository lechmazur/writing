<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("quiet desperation") with under-embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure strong but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension at peak stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: moth capture crystallizes her obsession with visible cost (city's destruction), under Accumulative/Textural lens where density shift reweights silence's value.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Infinity pendant (tool) constrains choice and charges final image ("time now her own"); canal system and giant's breath evolve causally to pressure tactics without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through temporal density (pendant's dissonance, giant's shallow breaths), but pressure lacks one tightening choice that narrows options before climax; cost legible but escalation slightly muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("wings etched with forgotten stars") reweights "silence predated sound" without moralizing; theme emerges through uncaged note's liberation, avoiding abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("iridescent scale of a fish not existed for a thousand years") with rhythmic control; stress compresses diction ("world stuttered") while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured rhythms of the world" exemplifies high-density propulsion; only minor abstraction in "reluctant sculptor" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-manipulation via sound physics; "borrowing from giant's nap" transforms trope through specific stakes, though moth risks archetypal familiarity without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
