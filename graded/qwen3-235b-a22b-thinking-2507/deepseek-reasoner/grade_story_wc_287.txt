<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (wistful sadness/pragmatic renewal) act simultaneously during soil preparation; final choice to plant light earned by ritual with visible cost in "vulnerability still there but protected." No therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "sadness for the beautiful, fleeting thing—was still there, but now protected." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; petal drop to starlight reweights loss with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lockmaster’s tooth constrains choice (scoring packets/aerating soil) and charges final image (shattering moonlight). Harbor’s "black glass" mirror directly shapes emotional arc—micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: rose’s absence → ritual → light creation. Dominant stake (transforming loss) tightens through biological timeframe; cost ("protected vulnerability") legible in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ending reweights premise through starlight constellation—no moralizing. "Cultivated tiny constellation" offers resonant answer to darkness; thematic cost ("sadness still there") emerges from concrete actions, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "vertical patchwork of terracotta and green," "rhythm of oars" motif modulates under pressure. Compression taught early (biological timeframe); zero head-hopping, lexicon consistent with gardener’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shattered by silver trails" achieves high density without muddle. Final line’s "rhythm of oars" reprise propels closure—no figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith’s tool repurposed as star-maker transforms loss into light. Specificity (bitting gauge fractures) avoids cliché; emotional truth in "protected vulnerability" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
