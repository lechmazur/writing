<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "archivist of ruin" motivation shift; embodied emotion in trembling fingers redesigning cards avoids therapy-speak. Final mosaic realization earns endurance with visible cost: transformed but persistent "luminescent ache" as creative fuel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "it was no longer a symptom of grief. It was the gentle light..." reconfigures despair's meaning with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via wall constrictions and card assembly, narrowing options to redesign.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Forgotten lighthouse library constrains choice: constricting walls force retreat to worktable, perpetual twilight illuminates fragments. Final image charges closure—"luminescent ache" transformed from grief symptom to creative light through tactile card assembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: walls constrict (pressure), she chooses redesign over repair (turn), creating Tower/Star synthesis (deepening). Cost is legible—"luminescent ache" persists but transforms, charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through card assembly: "a self... could be a mosaic" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image reweights "luminescent ache" as creative necessity, offering resonant answer to fragmentation—truth in intentional design, not forced wholeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fractured pieces" vision shapes all description. Rhythmic control under pressure—"groaning walls subsided" to focused silence—teaches compression early. No head-hopping; lyric fragments pay off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "luminescent ache" evolves meaningfully across beats. High density: "serene, upturned palms of The Star" fused with "plummeting Tower figures" does triple duty (action/theme/image). Final line’s "darkness... where new light could be born" avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: portrait artist’s fractured vision applied to tarot fragments creates organic metaphor. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure’s conceptual cost feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
