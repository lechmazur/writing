<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied trauma ("copper in mouth," "living cartography") with authentic contradiction between fragility and resilience. Epiphany risks thematic echo but saved by concrete action—the dropped strap embodies mercy as variable. Slight over-articulation in "mathematics of mercy" phrasing edges near therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the reflection reweights penance into self-mercy with undeniable conceptual cost when the strap falls. Accumulative lens holds relentlessly—every sensory detail accumulates toward this crystallized moment where his trauma becomes the equation's solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest actively constrains choices (luminescent path guides movement) and charges closure—the fractal fungi and sine-wave vines become the "mathematics" he seeks. Final image of his reflection refracted in violet light makes environment indispensable to the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: his proprioception shifts from curse to tool as he collects "variables," narrowing options toward the pedestal. Cost is visceral throughout—each step a "calculated agony"—culminating in the strap's release, which forecloses his penance with tangible physical/emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by making mercy a "variable" discovered through lived pain, not stated doctrine. Final image reweights the premise: the obsidian reflection transforms penance from external debt to "life already paid in full," with cost legible in the strap's silent fall—no tidy morals, only earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: every detail filtered through enhanced senses and trauma ("proprioceptively alight," "fluorescent pollen"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress—short, jarring phrases during spasms; flowing cadence when observing patterns. No POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines do triple duty (e.g., "bioluminescent fox—made him freeze and brace" advances plot, character, setting). "Living cartography of his own pain" shows rather than tells. One borderline abstract phrase ("systematic unmaking") compensated by immediate concrete follow-up ("raw data of existence").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms trauma narrative via math lens: not "inner peace" but mercy as a "derivable function." UV forest's glowing geometry feels fresh because details serve theme—fractal fungi aren't ornament but active variables. Risk-taking (conceptual penance) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise edges near familiar recovery arcs.</comment>
