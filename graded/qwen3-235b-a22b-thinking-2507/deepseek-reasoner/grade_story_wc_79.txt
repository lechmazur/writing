<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (academic vs. desperate need) drives micro-choices like studying patterns, but "sunwashed dread" leans toward label-only emotion without sufficient embodiment during peak gate-cracking tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with ironclad because/therefore logic: whistle pattern discovery → fracture song → surgical gate split. Cost is legible in the "weight of imprisonment lifting" and shift to "daunting light," foreclosing isolation with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turtle-shell micro-setting constrains the climax (vibrations traveling through shell) and charges the final image (cartographer of possible); reed whistle’s physicality shapes every key choice from discovery to gate-cracking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s agency: his pattern-language insight directly causes the gate’s fracture, narrowing options from futile force to surgical sound. Cost is unmistakable in the dread-to-daunting-light shift under causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (fracture song → connection song), not moralizing; final image reweights "lost expedition" as a path via the watchers’ spirals, offering resonant non-literal answer without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in cartographer’s pattern-focused noticing ("recurring, misunderstood pattern"); rhythmic control intensifies during whistle play ("pure and thin, a vibration... through the shell"), with no head-hopping or voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "sunwashed dread" in early description risks abstract labeling; minor register drift from Kaelen’s expertise ("sacred geometry") to lyrical phrasing slightly dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms isolation tropes through turtle-shell specificity and pattern-language mechanics; risk-taking (sound-based gate solution) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional truth in quiet drive outweighing surface novelty.</comment>
