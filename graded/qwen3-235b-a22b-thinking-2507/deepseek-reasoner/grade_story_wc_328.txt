<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bitterness that had fueled her... dissolved") manifests in embodied micro-choices like letting the arrowhead "pull her apart," avoiding therapy-speak. Final renunciation of bitterness earns closure through causal links to the phone's confessions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation clear by line 3 ("herbalist's underground garden," "cryptid researcher"). Closure is Earned Stasis: Elara's metamorphosis forecloses her investigative path with visible cost (human form gone), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where warped physics accumulates toward transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: misting-system water droplets' orbit shifts from atmospheric detail to active participant in the transformation. Final light's "playful" motion charges closure by reweighting ghost-pepper blossoms from scent anchor to cohabitation space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara's decision to "not fight" the arrowhead's pull crystallizes the dominant conflict (bitterness vs wonder) with felt cost (unraveling/re-knitting). Escalation driven by her choices under Accumulative lens, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: the final line ("the joke, she now knew, was beautiful") reweights "cosmic joke" from bitterness to harmony without moralizing. Closure offers non-literal answer via the light's playful motion, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope thawed") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "profoundly altered" slightly dilutes voice consistency at climax, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "water droplets... halted, coalesced... began a slow, waltzing orbit" demonstrates high density. One scaffolded phrase ("bitterness that had fueled her—the laughed-at papers...") triggers -0.3, but closure imagery remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic horror tropes through "harmony untamed" lens with specific botany details. Risk-taking (cordless phone as cosmic conduit) heightens stakes coherently, but "cosmic joke" phrasing edges toward recognizable territory, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
