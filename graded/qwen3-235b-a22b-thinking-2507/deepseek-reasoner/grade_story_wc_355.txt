<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the shift from acquisition to connection; "doubt crept in" edges toward emotional summary but the grandfather's quote earns the empathy arc with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: abandoning the catalog for human connection. The Accumulative lens holds perfectly as frequency tuning tightens pressure toward the sighing click.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brass clasp functions as micro-setting—constraining choice through vibration and resonance—charging the final image when it releases. Workshop details avoid white-room syndrome by tethering to Elara’s tactile process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: cataloging silence becomes secondary to recovering unspoken words. The single reversal (shifting from forcing to understanding the lock) narrows options with visible cost—her life’s work deferred for the diary’s truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silence-as-absence versus words-as-regret, crystallized by the grandfather’s line. Avoids moralizing by letting the fireworks’ visual counterpoint reweight silence without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "feeling frequencies" and "silence within the hum"; rhythmic control peaks during tuning sequences. No head-hopping, with psychic distance tightening under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Dramatic and utterly genuine relief" triggers slight redundancy; otherwise clean propulsion. Figurative language stays purposeful ("silence within the hum"), but minor scaffold in doubt paragraph costs 0.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes silence studies with emotional archaeology—transforming the "catalog" trope through tactile resonance. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by the click.</comment>
