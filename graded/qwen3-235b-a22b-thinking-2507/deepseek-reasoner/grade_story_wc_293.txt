<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's photographer-specific interiority ("dynamic aperture adjusting to light") grounds her motivation in embodied contradiction—seeking truth through broken tech while rejecting easy epiphanies. The fiddler's underdeveloped agency slightly undermines the relationship crucible, but her final choice to photograph mist over mystery earns visible cost through the plate's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the developed plate reconfigures the vanishing into "faint, beautiful echoes" with undeniable conceptual cost ("the hitchhiker was gone, but the possibility... was now permanently fixed"). The fiddler's coincidental appearance strains the Accumulative lens's pressure coherence, narrowly avoiding a causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The wet-plate camera and mountain pullout micro-setting constrain every choice—the car's mirror and pine branch in the pixelated plate directly enable the climax. The "swirling mist" evolving from atmospheric detail to canvas for traveler echoes charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's perceptual shift from "never knowing" to "sculpting possibility," but the fiddler's intervention feels externally imposed rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The cost—permanent loss transmuted into art—is legible yet the resolution lacks the earned friction required for 8.8+ under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scaffold metaphor's evolution: from photographic failure to structural truth in the plate's grid, culminating in the non-literal answer of "echoes" charging the final image. Avoids moralizing by making the plate's silver-and-glass permanence the resonant answer to transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("her mind a constant aperture adjusting to light"), but the fiddler's "scaffold wrap flutters" line strains plausibility with its abstract diction, momentarily breaking voice consistency. Otherwise, rhythmic control under pressure ("a human-shaped void in the world") teaches its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density until the climax beat where "the method was not to find the man" uses abstract diction inconsistent with Elara's tactile POV. This filter-verb stack slightly dulls closure's immediacy but avoids the -0.5 penalty by not clustering ≥3 lines, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing tropes through antique wet-plate photography's organic "pixelation," making the scaffold metaphor feel inevitable. The risk of Accumulative structure pays off via the plate's evolving role, with specificity ("collodion glass flake") anchoring universals without abstraction.</comment>
