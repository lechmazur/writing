<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elian rejects "efficient training" to touch the keystone, embodying his "sacred in the simple" drive through micro-choices like repurposing blanket straps. Final vigil earns endurance via tactile cost ("cold seeped into his bones"), though internal conflict could deepen during mist walking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Elian’s choice to guard the spire forecloses guild compliance with visceral cost ("cold seeped into his bones"). Causal lens holds perfectly—"unstrapping" supplies enables preservation, tightening options under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains every choice: the keystone’s warmth against bitter air forces insulation tactics, while "brilliant dimness" evolves from atmosphere to thematic embodiment in the final vigil. Micro-setting (leather straps) charges closure through purposeful reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when keystone’s glow fades post-mist walk—Elian must protect it from dismantling. Agency-driven escalation: his blanket-wrapping choice narrows options to solitary vigil, with tangible cost ("cold seeped into his bones") charging the final image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "conserving possibility" gains weight via Elian’s blanket ritual, not abstraction. Final image reweights "sacred in the simple" as active resistance, though "conserve possibility" phrasing slightly edges toward tell in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices "muted silver coin" sun and "pathetic echo" of gardens, filtering world through his undervalued lens. Rhythmic control peaks during mist walking’s "silent, swirling grey," with elision taught early and paid off in spire’s return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: "He poured the last of his will... into a basic, sustained cooling charm" compresses emotion and action. One minor scaffold in "overwhelming, profound, and utterly simple" slightly dulls mist walking’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automation tropes: "hand-watered rose" and mist walking as "feeling, a becoming of the vapour" transform familiar ideas. Risk-taking (rejecting efficiency for vigil) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes slightly in final paragraph.</comment>
