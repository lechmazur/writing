<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("hollowed out by grief," "heart a drum of fear") with embodied contradiction—Elias's passivity versus the guides' insistence he carries what he needs. Final choice to climb earns change through causal progression, though guides lack individual depth beyond atmospheric function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias finds "unused courage" on the ridge with visible cost ("no strength left," mist-veiled path). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density tightens from river to vigil to ridge, reweighting stakes via the star's fading light. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (star stamp) charges closure: its twilight glow guides the climb and dims as purpose fulfills. Environment constrains choices—indirect routes avoid swift channels, veiled ridgeway demands faith in the star. Sensory details ("blue flame," "crumbling shale") filter through Elias's exhaustion without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming grief-fueled paralysis) tightens via Elias's agency: the ridge climb crystallizes stance under pressure. Cost is visceral ("heart a drum of fear," "no strength left") and shapes tactics—relying on the star's light. Escalation deepens through Accumulative lens, narrowing options from river to solitary ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the star stamp reweights from toll to inner compass. Final image ("star-dusted delta," dimming star) offers resonant answer to "unused courage" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in physical struggle ("one foot after the other").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("river's leash," "silt-colored eyes") with rhythmic control matching journey's pace. Voice modulates under pressure—compression during ridge climb ("mist veiled the summit") preserves immediacy. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Elias's sensory depletion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("dip of an oar," "tenacious moss"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle ("star... fragment of twilight sky"). Final line ("wind and profound peace") recharges opening's "river's leash" with earned cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ferry trope through specific logic: ticket punch star as toll/internal compass. Emotional truth anchors universals in Elias's unnamed grief. Risk-taking in quiet closure avoids gimmickry—ridge climb synthesizes physical/spiritual struggle into singular, inevitable image.</comment>
