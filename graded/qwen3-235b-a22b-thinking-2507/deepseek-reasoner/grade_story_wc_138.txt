<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in millennia of loss drives credible change from boredom to solemn understanding; micro-choice (stepping into vortex) reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. Slight abstraction in "solemn understanding" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "profound silence" replacing "hushed thunder" crystallizes the shift from boredom to purpose. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory/conceptual density build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (warped geometry forces vortex entry) and charges final image ("shimmering walls... with new eyes"). Sensory details vividly filter through immortal POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through solar storm's live clock tightening decisions; cost unmistakable in "profound silence" replacing hushed thunder. Escalation minimal but sufficient under accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (solar wind echoes, crystal spires as cosmic resonance); final image "reason to say hello again" reweights "after goodbye" without moralizing. Epiphany earned through visceral experience, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ancient eyes," dimensional awareness) modulates rhythm from lethargic to urgent. Minor abstraction in "solemn understanding" slightly dilutes emotional texture under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("floor yawned open not into a pit"). Final paragraph's "profound silence... no longer bored" achieves crystalline closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality trope through "after goodbye" lens; specific details (prismatic escondite, amulet's green veins) transform cosmic themes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
