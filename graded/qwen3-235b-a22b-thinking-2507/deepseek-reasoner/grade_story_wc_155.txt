<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (despair vs memory-triggered hope) act simultaneously when touching the fragment; final choice to create with film is earned through visceral taste memory and micro-choices like climbing walls. No therapy-speak despite emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("light began to fade... but the feeling remained") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Fog-to-light density shift reweights stakes, though "knowledge network" mechanics slightly obscure causality in one beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog functions as active constraint enabling the film medium and charging the final image ("learn how to see in the dark"). Ruined orchard details (rusted rods, brittle branches) concretely shape tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single deepening—realizing light itself is the medium—narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the fading installation yet enduring communal emotion, fulfilling Band 8.8+ requirement for felt price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line reweights "pensive mirth" into earned wisdom without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (apricot fragment → light-weaving), avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo despite high emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("soul a canvas of colors," taste of "dusty sweetness"). Rhythm modulates under pressure: frantic clauses during installation build to crystalline final line. Zero POV drift despite memory intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "ghost of a feeling so potent it was almost pain" avoids therapy-speak through embodied specificity. Final line recharges "see in the dark" with crystalline clarity. Peak beats use sparse, precise diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light physics and memory activation transforms "artist's block" trope. Fog-enabled film technique feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity ("old woman wept, remembering") avoiding generic uplift.</comment>
