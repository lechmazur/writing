<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from hunter to keeper; embodied emotion in "breath pluming" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: "profound joy surged" slightly labels feeling where deeper contradiction could have heightened stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with sextant's collapse as felt cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory escalation, though the "invite not capture" pivot slightly over-explains where subtext could have charged more.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog and frost actively constrain perception and ritual timing; "glass mountains" tone charges the final image. Micro-setting triumph: sextant's physical decay mirrors the dream's resistance, directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the sextant's escalating fragility and frost's fading light, narrowing options to her breathing rhythm. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though the dream's "wild" resistance lacks deeper causal escalation beyond sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mirror's transformation from prison to home; "tenant not prisoner" crystallizes without moralizing. Near-miss: "she was not a hunter but a mirror maker" edges toward tell where pure image could have resonated harder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent air," "skeletal trees bore blossoms of glowing silver") modulates perfectly with tension. Rhythmic control in breathing sequence embodies her focus; no head-hopping despite deep interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost began to glow more intensely" shows through action. Minor density risk in "crystalline, immense, and perilously fragile" but payoff in final image saves it. Propulsion never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artisan craft and dream physics feels inevitable; the sextant's broken state transforms tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes—using a ruined tool for delicate work—without gimmickry, charging the closure.</comment>
