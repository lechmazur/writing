<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (accepting low luck-score while actively mending through ritual) drive her endurance. Final choice to polish despite official’s warning earns closure through visible cost: his shattered worldview. Strength lies in embodied motivation ("gardens know their gardeners") made visceral via marble ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): garden recognizing Elara crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost ("he had no metric for what he was witnessing"). Orientation flawless by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ritual density culminating in transcendent light. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as active constraint—its "blooming withering" state pressures Elara’s choices. The marbles as micro-setting charge the climax: "exploded into a constellation of captured light" reweights the dominant stake. Environment directly shapes the final image’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: polishing ritual deepens stakes until the official’s arrival forces crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in his closed device—a visible worldview collapse. "The garden was not responding to luck. It was recognizing her" reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: polishing cracks embodies finding value in struggle. Final image ("victory silent, elaborate, and complete") reweights "luck" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "they cannot measure a conversation" crystallizes insight through character voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elara notices "thorn-scars," "velvet pouch," and "brittle leaves" with gardener’s specificity. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences at climax ("She simply smiled...") heighten tension. Zero head-hopping; voice remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies purpose ("hands were a map of thorn-scars" establishes history + character + setting). Final line’s propulsion ("victory silent, elaborate, and complete") avoids figurative muddle. Peak-beat clarity in "boundary between vine and dresser blurred."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "magic realism" through grounded mechanics: marble ritual isn’t magical but psychological/communal. Emotional truth in "commemorating small victories elaborately" feels inevitable. Fresh angle: luck metrics as social control countered by embodied practice.</comment>
