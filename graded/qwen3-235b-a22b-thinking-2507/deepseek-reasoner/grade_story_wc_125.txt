<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for time's texture is clear but abstract; "heart a battlefield" is label-only feeling triggering diagnostic penalty. Contradictory impulses under pressure lack embodiment—no simultaneous physical/emotional micro-choices during the rope disruption that reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: disrupting the pattern forecloses time-unraveling with visible cost ("quiet, profound sadness," erased lineage). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure deepens via layered meaning (rope/light/clay convergence), not causality. Cost proof: "weight of his decision" crystallizes consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto’s clay strata mirror the rope pattern, charging the final image ("rope just a relic"), but setting doesn’t constrain choices—e.g., no spatial limitation forcing hurried decisions. Misses 9+ gate: environment enriches theme but doesn’t alter tactics during the critical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael’s agency: arranging rope triggers vision, deepening stakes from abstract desire to annihilation of hope. Cost is unmistakable ("entire future lineage erased"), but moral calculus lacks competing goods—prison escape backstory feels thin, muting the dilemma’s visceral weight until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rope’s frayed fibers whispering "desperation," tapestry metaphor reweighted as "responsibility." Avoids moralizing; final line ("weight... new kind of poetry") offers resonant non-literal answer. Slight drift toward abstraction in "infinite connections" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust that glittered under twin moons," "heart beating a rhythm"), but abstract labels ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") dull immediacy during peak pressure. Rhythm varies effectively, yet stress-induced compression (e.g., fragmented syntax during vision) is missed, muting emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("He saw that the pattern he’d made mirrored...") and near-loop ("shudder... deepening of silence") in mid-beat, but zero artifacts in closure. High density overall—"frayed rope whispering of desperation" avoids purple prose. No figurative muddle; final line’s cadence elevates without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through tactile focus ("texture," rope as key) and fresh moral weight (erasing a "gentle people’s" lineage). But energy beings feel derivative, and grotto vision lacks novelty. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, yet synthesis isn’t transformative enough for 8.5+.</comment>
