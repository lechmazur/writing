<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: altering course for the gear then weaving data shows shifting values. Final renunciation of passive archiving earns closure with palpable cost ("heavy weight in her being"), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Slight underdevelopment of "sentimentalist" motivation pre-discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable cost: "troubling serenity... filled with new purpose" reconfigures the garden’s meaning. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as data integration deepens stakes. Minor pacing stumble in the "new pattern" discovery moment slightly weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden functions as active micro-setting: sonar pinging shapes navigation and echoes in closure, while "falling petals" time constraint alters tactics. Recurring gear charges final image ("heavy weight" becoming key to purpose). Sensory selectivity masterful but could deepen physical constraints earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: gear’s predictive model transforms archiving into active search, narrowing options to "searching for the break." Conceptual cost legible in "gilded cage" realization. Pressure tightens via knowledge deepening, though discovery moment lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "weaving data into magnetic fields" embodies the non-moral answer to cyclical doom. Final image reweights serenity as "patient purpose" without stating thesis. Avoids thematic echo despite "light that did not fade" phrasing skirting sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sonar-driven navigation shapes all description ("ripples of precise data"). Rhythmic control modulates perfectly to emotional beats ("quiet sigh of falling petals"). Minor register drift in "predictive model" phrasing briefly disrupts cosmic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("unleashed a torrent," "threading poetry"). Figurative language sparse yet potent ("gilded cage of failure"). Technical phrasing ("infinitesimal variables") slightly jars but doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope via cosmic scale: gear as both tombstone and compass synthesizes novelty. Emotional specificity in "deep melancholy" avoids abstraction. Nebula garden setting slightly familiar but redeemed by active micro-setting integration. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes.</comment>
