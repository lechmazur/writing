<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("nervously confident") embodied through trembling hands yet clear ritual speech; micro-choices (silent apology while digging) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost in the nail's transformation. Slight deduction for overly tidy emotional progression from dread to peace without intermediate friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: "experimental weather station" not anchored until paragraph 3 (~150 words), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Earned Stasis via ghost's dissolution) lands with conceptual cost (fulfilled nail's inertness) under Hybrid lens, but causality gap: why coordinates were instantly locatable on modern map weakens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" evolves from atmospheric cliché to active constraint (swelling fears, muting moss) that directly charges the final image (clean wind scouring air). Recurring copper nail's verdigris light and physical weight constrain choices during retrieval and ritual, fulfilling 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clearing ancestor's name) tightens through ritual performance, but pressure lacks escalation under Hybrid lens—dread remains static environmental pressure rather than compounding opposition. Cost (nail's purpose fulfilled) is legible but not visibly reweighted through protagonist agency beyond the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image (clean wind scouring stagnant air) resonantly answers "broken balances" theme without moralizing, reweighting jet stream shift through localized human action. Avoids thematic echo despite Elara's declaration; legacy restoration emerges implicitly from copper nail's inertness and wind's tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: librarian's map-focused noticing ("faded ink," "topographical map") and weather-station hum shaping sensory hierarchy. Tense stability falters slightly when ghost materializes ("air tightened... grew sharp" shifts to past-perfect rhythm without psychic distance shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Quiet, burning thing" risks stock phrasing but redeemed by immediate concrete action (tracing ink). Zero loops/scaffold; "spongey dread" evolves lexically ("absorbing fears," "weight of failure") with purposeful rhythm shifts. Minor deduction for "immense relief" bordering abstract in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical exoneration via literal "anchor" object within climate disaster framework. Bold risk in making atmospheric dread the active antagonist; specificity of "rubbery moss" and "verdigris light" transforms tropes. Closure's wind avoids symmetrical satisfaction by acknowledging jet stream remains broken.</comment>
