<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through concrete embodiment ("chronologically homesick heart ached... for a specific irretrievable moment"). Micro-choices like placing the nautilus segment against glass reveal value hierarchy. Slight abstraction in "resonance she had spent a lifetime recapturing" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: exhaustion-fueled collapse with visible cost ("profound weariness... but smiling") reconfigures meaning ("homesickness gone, replaced by arrival"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to dawn alignment. Cost legible in "exhaustion hit her... sent her to her knees."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (nautilus shell) constrains choices as "tuner" against glass, charging final image ("curled beside warm nautilus shell"). Spire and frozen lake actively pressure tactics via mirrored horizon mechanics. Meets 9+ gate through object-as-setting that alters outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("succeed before exhaustion") tightens via accumulative escalation: sensory deepening (grey sky to lavender/blue ice) and memory layering narrow options. Visible cost in collapse alters final state (sleep replaces striving). Agency clear in superimposing hum despite no physical baton.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "conductor of unheard symphonies" becomes literal via memory-conducted vibrations. Final image reweights journey without moralizing ("homesickness gone... profound sense of arrival"). Avoids thematic echo; fortune cookie integrated as motivation, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath a pale ghost against cold transparent wall") shows character-particular noticing. Rhythm varies naturally (short clauses for tension). Psychic distance shifts intentionally during memory layering. Elision of grandfather's voice taught early and paid off at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("world was a study in monochrome" does triple duty). Final image avoids purple prose. One hairline slip: "sublime, silent meeting" slightly abstract but redeemed immediately by concrete action ("saw it—the memory and the moment were the same").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific precision ("logarithmic spiral") and mystical resonance. Emotional specificity ("tears froze on her cheeks as she sculpted the air") avoids wonder clichés. Transformation test passed—changing names/setting would break spire-ice-horizon mechanics.</comment>
