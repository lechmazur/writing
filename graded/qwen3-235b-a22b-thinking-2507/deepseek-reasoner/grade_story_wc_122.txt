<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness drives every choice; embodied emotion shines when tears "streamed down her face" during drumming. Minor flaw: "voice she never trusted" lacks prior concrete demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when she abandons the needle for resonant peace, with undeniable cost felt in "music recorded forever backward in her bones." Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through sensory buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drum cavern’s vibrations literally constrain choices and charge the ending; "taut hide" and waterfall hum force tactile engagement. Micro-setting functions as environment, body, and tool converging to reconfigure her world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through sensory escalation: leaf-crunch vibrations to drum’s "primal voice." Cost crystallizes when abandoning the needle forecloses old solutions for new language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mirrored hush" transforming from void to canvas via action, not moralizing. Final image ("enthralled by the vibration of living") reweights silence without stating a thesis, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "crisp air whispered of endings" renders sound tactile. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when drumming syntax compresses to visceral fragments ("sorrow... joy... release"). Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("silence so complete it reflected...") slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise impeccable density: "backward recorded songs" delivers dual sensory/conceptual work without scaffold or loops in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deaf music teacher premise transforms tropes through vibration-language specificity. Risk-taking (quiet climax via tactile resonance) heightens stakes coherently; "filament of hush" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
