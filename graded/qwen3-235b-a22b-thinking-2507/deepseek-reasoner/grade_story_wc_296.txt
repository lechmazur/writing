<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's guarded pride manifests in embodied contradiction—her "warlike serenity" shatters when touching the frozen confession, revealing withheld guilt through visceral action ("it shatters, and the released words echo"). Micro-choice to integrate (not destroy) the seed earns the climax with visible cost in her vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vortex rings deepen pressure (shredded petals → frozen calm), culminating in Earned Stasis where redirecting the seed's hunger reconfigures consumption with felt cost ("she had to unbend further, to open"). Closure crystallizes options via conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cursed lake's vortex constrains every choice—Elara walks water to enter, rings dictate tactics, and the seed's integration clears the water. Final image ("The lake was still, and so was she") charges closure through environmental mirroring, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (heal grove vs. confront guilt) tightens through Accumulative escalation: the vortex's contraction after the confession shatters forces the seed integration choice. Agency is pure protagonist action—redirecting hunger with visible cost in her emotional uncoiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme ("consumption isn't always evil") emerges through concrete action: seed consumes rot, forest grows through consumption. Final image reweights the concept without moralizing—Elara's forgiveness "starting with herself" resonates as a non-literal answer to mirrors hiding truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Druidic perceptual signature shines: "ancient trees into its gyre like splinters" filters nature through her expertise. Rhythm accelerates in the vortex approach ("shredded petals... splintered trunks... frozen calm"), modulating under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silence... a physical weight" avoids cliché through specificity. "Spectral, crystalline sculpture" slightly over-ornate but justified by POV—no figurative muddle in peak beats. Propulsion peaks with "She pushes it into the soft earth."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "druid heals nature" trope via psychological depth: frozen confession as crystallized guilt feels inevitable. Emotional specificity ("capacity for forgiveness starting with herself") avoids redemption templates, synthesizing magic and regret into fresh stakes.</comment>
