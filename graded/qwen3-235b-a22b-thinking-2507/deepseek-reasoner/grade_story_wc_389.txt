<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "gritty determination" vs. "whimsical hope," with micro-choices like chalk transcriptions revealing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of centralized broadcast feels earned, though Unified Dawn's rise lacks sufficient prior vulnerability buildup to fully ground her despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: her voice dissolving into "a secret passed on the wind" reconfigures options under Accumulative lens. Unified Dawn's jamming tightens pressure organically, though their emergence feels slightly convenient rather than causally inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt portico transcends setting to constrain choices and charge closure—it evolves from prison to lens to final image where rain/hum carry refracted meaning. Sensory details like "sapphire shards" and "gritty chalk" serve urgency, though cloud-veil city below remains underutilized physical anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: jamming forces fracturing broadcast, a meaningful deepening that narrows options while changing message reception. Cost is unmistakable—"her voice dissolving into static" charges the final image with conceptual price of decentralized truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: prophet's words distorted then fractured, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("a puzzle unfolding forever") reweights "variant allegiance" without stating morals, though "nascent faith" slightly overstates thematic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"lightning fracturing into sapphire shards," static "slithering"—with syntax compressing under stress ("She made her choice"). Minor POV drift in "nascent faith" slightly distances voice from character's immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crackle of equipment tuned to fragmented frequencies that slithered" exemplifies layered density. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction. Near-miss: "whimsical hope" / "stubborn whimsical belief" risks subtle repetition but deepens in context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms signal tropes through "variant allegiance" as active principle—resolution via dispersal, not victory. Cobalt portico's evolution and stormlit observatory as pressure-cooker showcase organic synthesis. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
