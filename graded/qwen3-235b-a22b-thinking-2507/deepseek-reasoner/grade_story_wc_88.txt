<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradictions ("jaded wonder curdled into painful clarity"), but the erased-record backstory lacks active constraint on choices. Final micro-choice to hand over baseball without excuses earns visible cost through grandson's hardened face. Slightly thin flaw integration beyond "thief's fingers" label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: grandson's "dawning of jaded wonder" crystallizes empathy's fragility with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds rigorously from erased record to delivery. Only hairline slip is baseball's time-travel convenience, mitigated by early setup in newspaper discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting, charging the final image ("fragile ember" echoing "delicately robust" glow) and supplying discovery light. However, cave geography lacks tactical constraint beyond lamp failure; spatial choreography remains generic despite sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindling empathy) tightens meaningfully when Elara chooses connection over excuses, foreclosing survival tactics. Visible cost in grandson's struggle between disbelief and wonder. Escalation driven by agency under causal lens, though internal conflict lacks external pressure spikes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: baseball's journey reweights "labyrinth of choices" without moralizing. Final image ("fragile ember") offers resonant answer to empathy quest, avoiding thematic echo. Cost is conceptual—time-travel proof challenging lifelong bitterness—felt in grandson's face.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in newspaper misalignment reading and "jaded wonder" phrasing. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in cave sequence ("lamp flickered and died"). Minor deduction for "thief's fingers" cliché, but voice remains consistently character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ethereal blue light pulsed from intricate fungal patterns") propels without muddle. Final line’s "fragile ember" achieves textural specificity. One borderline purple phrase ("delicately robust") avoided cost-dulling through thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms time-travel trope into empathy calculus. Baseball's "message in a bottle cast backwards" feels inevitable, with risk-taking (quiet cave climax) heightening stakes. Emotional specificity passes transformation test—swapping names would break the grandson's visceral payoff.</comment>
