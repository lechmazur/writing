<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fear of missing moment" vs exhaustion) drives micro-choices; embodied emotion in "weary eyes" avoids labels. Misses one micro-choice during vision onset where panic could yield to trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: blank canvas reweighted to "invitation" via conscious stillness. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; "remembered stardust" vision crystallizes options with felt cost in "trembling and irrevocably changed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora archway functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("portal through which cosmos gazed back"). Sextant's "weight in hands" constrains choice during star alignment, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightening through exhaustion ("eyelids heavy but fear of missing moment") deepens under Accumulative lens. Cost crystallizes when frantic energy yields to "calm certainty," altering her creative approach with visible reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "remembered stardust" becoming embodied paint. Final image ("figure composed of billion points of ancient light") reweights premise without moralizing, achieving resonant non-literal answer to creative block.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "silent music of spheres" and aurora's "bleed of green/violet." Near-slip: "shadowed rapture" risks abstraction but saved by concrete vision details. Rhythmic control peaks in painting sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "profound peace of one who has finally come home" edges toward sentimentality but avoids it through concrete action ("hand began to move"). Propulsion flawless despite lyrical density in vision sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's block" trope via cosmic integration. Sextant's mystery enabling revelation feels fresh; "remembered stardust" synthesizes physics and creativity with emotional specificity. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
