<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction in "hand hesitated" then urgent sketching shows micro-choices under pressure. Final reclamation earned by tactile compass rose interaction, but confusion-to-curiosity shift slightly under-struggled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "confusion began to transmute" crystallizes stance with "strange and terrible curiosity." Accumulative lens holds via density buildup (streaks→rivers of time), though fleeting star glimpse edges toward convenient pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: viewport's temporal distortion directly constrains sketching action, while compass rose on vac-suit sleeve charges closure. Sensory selection ("hum of failing systems," charcoal scratch") filters through astronaut's urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when sketching shifts from copying chaos to "interpreting it," narrowing options to active reclamation. Cost is felt in confusion's transmutation, but the lodestar glimpse slightly softens agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete evolution: "true north" reframes from fixed point to process via sketch mechanics. Final image ("echoed with scratch of charcoal") delivers non-literal answer to navigation question without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in temporal distortion details ("luminous brushstrokes," "ghost of breath"). Rhythm modulates perfectly from contemplative to urgent, though "profound confusion" slightly abstracts before concrete follow-up.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "temporally stretched light was not a curse" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line's cadence ("echoed with the scratch... promising more maps") charges closure, with only minor abstraction in "profound confusion" costing 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation sci-fi with intimate ritual: transforms "true north" trope through specific context (temporal distortion). Emotional truth in using ancestral charts to combat existential disorientation elevates familiar survivor setup.</comment>
