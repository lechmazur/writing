<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "doubt seeped" vs. "would not let fear freeze her hand," with embodied cost in aching hand and hand hovering over parchment. Micro-choice to write despite heresy risk earns closure, though "pure and sharp motivation" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the tremor proves conceptual cost ("not an ending, but a commencement") under Causal lens. Because she writes, the lake groans—visible cost reconfigures stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain every choice: ice is the starvation constraint, lake vibrations enable her model. Kingfisher feather’s "relic from a time when things could still fly" charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her predictive modeling narrowing options to writing the blueprint. Conceptual cost—risk of heresy and hand’s physical ache—is unmistakable, though secondary "old ways" conflict lacks full dramatization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "innovation born of the constraint" crystallizes in the aquaculture blueprint’s final period. Ending reweights ice not as death but "frozen ground of the real," avoiding moralizing while resonating with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific ("geothermal charts") blends with poetic ("pregnant with possibility"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato doubt versus flowing modeling—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "house of cards" metaphor serves character logic. Propulsion accelerates through "each word was a step," with final line’s "frozen ground of the real" achieving high density. "Groundedly imaginative" slightly jars but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" transforms tropes through specific stakes: mapping unknowns to seed icy aquaculture. Emotional truth in writing-as-prevailing feels inevitable, with risk-taking (no sword, only sentences) heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
