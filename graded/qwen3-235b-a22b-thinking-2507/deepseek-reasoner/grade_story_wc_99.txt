<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied grief ("pull deep within her chest") and contradictory impulses (seeking color while fixated on horizon) feel authentic; Kaito slightly functional as catalyst but earns weight through the compass revelation that transforms her stance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: compass needle pointing to her heart crystallizes the "cerulean regret" transformation with undeniable cost ("washing it clean, leaving behind something new"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first drip of rainwater to final shore imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Islet setting actively constrains choice—the compass directs movement to the workshop, and "wet wood and peat" air charges the lace discovery; micro-setting (shingled workshop) becomes essential pressure point for the thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency: her failed attempt to "diffuse pain" forces tactile engagement with lace, narrowing options to acceptance; the "solid, aching mass" of regret evolves into "color of peace" with felt cost in the compass's final heartbeat-like pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars—lace knots as "language of thread" show unspoken apologies without moralizing; final image ("color of peace") reweights the "cerulean regret" with earned resonance, avoiding thematic echo through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara's grief-filtered observations ("empty sea that stretched toward a forever she could no longer see"); rhythmic control mirrors placid tides then tightens during the lace revelation, though Kaito's "tides of remembrance" line edges toward thematic tell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line propels ("sorrow as vast and blue as the ocean" crystallizes emotion without cliché); final line ("washed anew on a familiar shore") delivers crystalline closure with no figurative muddle, though "cerulean regret" repetition slightly risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms bonsai/ghost ship tropes through tactile specificity: lace as emotional map feels fresh, avoiding sentimentality by rooting "unspoken apologies" in hitches and loops; risk-taking (conceptual compass) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
