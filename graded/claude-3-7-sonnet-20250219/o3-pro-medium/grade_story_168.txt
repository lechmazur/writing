<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maribel is a vivid character whose "ruthless" approach to flower arranging extends brilliantly to her methodical decoding of ancient glyphs. Her intellectual spontaneity manifests in compelling ways—her theories about flowers and constellations, her unconventional methods. The narrator's "watcher" role creates an effective dynamic, though their own motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped compared to Maribel's distinctive presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot builds coherently from arrival at the stone circle to the discovery and decoding of the rock art. The use of wilting flowers to distinguish true glyphs is inventive, and the narrative achieves satisfying closure when the map is revealed and the characters become "guardians." The pacing occasionally feels rushed when transitioning between significant revelations, but maintains overall coherence within the constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work creates a liminal, mystical setting. The stone circle, moorland, and "stalled sun" establish a suspended reality where ancient knowledge can emerge. Sensory details are masterful: the music from a distant festival, the glowing green sap on stone, the final echo of the breaking comb. The marriage of modern elements (plastic comb, van) with mystical archaeology creates compelling temporal dissonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story excels in its layered metaphors and imagery—particularly the recurring motif of pauses between verses as moments of revelation, and flowers as celestial witnesses. The central tension between ancient knowledge and modern observation resolves beautifully. Language is precise and evocative: "grey pillars cast long commas over the grass," and "roots count seasons in petals not numbers." The story invites reflection on how we access and interpret lost knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns with its distinctive voice and unconventional connections. Metaphors are fresh ("absorbing her sentences the way stone absorbs lichen") and the premise is genuinely original. Some sentences occasionally drift toward excessive lyricism ("polite anarchy granting us room to rewrite forgotten heavens"), but the consistent tone and thematic coherence suggest authentic authorial vision rather than algorithmic construction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The integration of assigned elements feels remarkably organic, with the flower arranger's skills repurposed for archaeological discovery and the comb becoming a tool for revealing hidden knowledge. The story's brevity feels intentional rather than limiting, creating a concentrated mystical experience. The lingering impression of becoming "guardians" of ancient celestial knowledge provides substantive thematic resonance beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
