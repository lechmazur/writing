<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Joryn's character is remarkably well-crafted within the word constraint. His role as an obituary writer for the living gives him immediate depth, while his consistently rebellious nature manifests in concrete actions and choices. His motivation to restore the lost art form provides a compelling drive that shapes his decisions. The character's connection to the mask and pipe organ feels organic rather than contrived. What prevents a higher score is the limited opportunity to see his internal conflict; we understand his purpose but get only glimpses of his emotional journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot structure demonstrates exceptional cohesion. The narrative moves logically from discovery (the mask) to understanding (the pipe organ's purpose) to action (creating the obituaries) to resolution (preparing to spread revolution). The labyrinth of choices concept is brilliantly integrated as both literal setting and metaphorical framework. Every element serves the plot progression without feeling forced. The pacing expertly balances action and revelation, avoiding both rushed exposition and narrative drag. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear causality throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building achieves remarkable depth through precision rather than excess. The giant's bookshelf setting works perfectly with the revolutionary timeframe, creating a microcosm that mirrors the larger world's tensions. Sensory details are exquisiteâ€”from "dust-furred spine" to the "metallic scent of ink and thunder." The pipe organ chamber within the giant's hollow spine creates a layered metaphor that enhances both setting and theme. The atmosphere of "lucid frenzy" perfectly complements the revolutionary context while maintaining internal logic throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through its layered metaphors and symbolic depth. The obituaries as catalysts for courage rather than death markers is a brilliant subversion. The prose achieves literary quality without becoming self-indulgent, employing fresh imagery ("scrolls of condensed mist coiled into his satchel like obedient dragons") that enhances rather than distracts. The theme of art as revolutionary act resonates profoundly. The story excels at showing rather than telling, allowing readers to feel the significance of each action through consequence rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its central conceit and execution. The writing avoids formulaic patterns and predictable tropes, instead crafting a fresh magical system with internal logic. The mask's changing expressions and the pipe organ's manifestation capabilities feel inventive rather than derivative. Occasional moments of slightly purple prose ("letting rebellion steady rather than shake him") and some overly precise descriptors prevent a higher score. However, the emotional nuance and consistent tone demonstrate authenticity throughout, with metaphors that feel specific to this world rather than generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, integrating them so naturally that they feel essential rather than imposed. The elements serve the narrative rather than constraining it. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a concentrated experience rather than an abbreviated one. The story leaves readers with resonant questions about art's revolutionary potential and the power of imagining alternate futures. The writing demonstrates both technical skill and creative innovation, particularly in how it transforms the obituary concept into something transcendent rather than morbid.</comment>
