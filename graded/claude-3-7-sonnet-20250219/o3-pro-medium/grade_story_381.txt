<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hushed necromancer Lorin has clear motivation tied to his brother's memory, effectively using necromancy as a tool for personal cartography rather than power. His preference for whispers over chants creates a distinctive personality, though his emotional depth feels somewhat constrained by metaphorical language rather than allowing raw vulnerability to emerge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from cave exploration to necromantic communion in the theater-like chamber, creating a satisfying emotional arc within the word constraint. The parallel between mapping physical caves and emotional resolution provides thematic unity, though the transition from mapping to the spectral theater feels slightly rushed, with some logical connections requiring reader inference.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is exceptionally rendered with sensory detailâ€”shimmering neon dust, glowing calcite blades, and resonating crystals create a vivid underworld. The juxtaposition of subterranean silence with concerts above establishes a compelling liminality that reinforces the necromancer's position between life and death, memory and present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs cinema metaphors (projector, marquee, intermission) to create resonant subtext about memory preservation and grief. The spectral cartography serves as an effective vehicle for exploring themes of loss and remembrance. The resolution offers catharsis without oversimplification, though some imagery verges on overelaboration that occasionally dilutes emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates significant originality in its fusion of necromancy with cartography and cinema, avoiding common fantasy tropes. The writing exhibits a distinctive style with precise imagery and unconventional metaphors. However, occasional overreliance on abstract constructions ("sound of resolve," "mineral time") creates moments of emotional distance where more concrete, specific details would strengthen authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates diverse assigned elements into a cohesive whole with notable thematic unity. The balance between fantastical necromancy and human grief creates emotional resonance, and the cinema-mapping metaphor provides conceptual depth. While occasionally sacrificing clarity for poetic effect, the story leaves readers with lingering questions about memory, grief, and the boundaries between worlds.</comment>
