<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is clearly established as a sincere rebel fighting against careless renovation, with consistent motivation throughout. Her connection to preservation and tradition is well-integrated with her backstory of masonry school, creating a character whose actions align with her established traits. However, her emotional journey could be more nuanced—her transformation from fear to resolve happens somewhat abruptly without enough interior struggle shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from Mara entering the passage to discovering architectural knowledge and emerging with newfound purpose. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, maintaining clear cause-and-effect relationships throughout. The theorizing action drives discovery effectively, and the story achieves a satisfying arc that begins with uncertainty and concludes with resolution. The pacing manages to create tension, revelation, and closure without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through meticulous sensory details—the drumming rain, lightning illuminating carvings, moaning whispers through cracks. The haunted passage setting perfectly complements the themes of preservation and hidden knowledge. The interplay between storms outside and revelation within creates a powerful metaphorical framework. The physical environment actively participates in the narrative through shifting stones and responsive architecture, making the setting a character itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively builds meaning through layered symbolism—physical architecture mirroring social tradition, storms paralleling emotional turbulence. The central conflict between preservation and modernization resonates beyond the immediate plot. Strong use of show-don't-tell technique with the wall physically responding to Mara's vulnerability. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction while maintaining thematic resonance. The prose balances lyricism with clarity, though occasionally verges on becoming too ornate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the story displays originality in its concept of responsive architecture and the personification of building traditions, some metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("secrets kept bricks steady the way oaths kept hearts steady"). The language occasionally becomes unnecessarily elaborate and self-conscious. The emotional progression has moments of genuine resonance but sometimes relies on abstract statements rather than specific emotional reactions. The core concept avoids predictability, but the execution occasionally slips into patterns that feel calculated rather than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends formula. The brevity serves the mysterious atmosphere well, creating space for reader imagination. The conceptual framework of tradition embodied in architecture is intellectually engaging while maintaining emotional resonance. While occasionally veering into overly ornate language, the story achieves a distinctive voice and leaves the reader with lingering questions about the relationship between physical spaces, memory, and community values.</comment>
