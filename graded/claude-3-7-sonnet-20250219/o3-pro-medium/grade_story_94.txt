<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corva's character as a "femme fatale heartbreak counselor" is vividly realized through her professional distance yet personal vulnerability. Her restless curiosity drives her actions consistently, creating tension between her role helping others untangle desires while being trapped by her own. The amber earrings function as both plot device and character mirror, revealing her conflicted nature. The final line about her "own orbit" brilliantly captures her character arc without overstating it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "zip" action to propel both physical movement and narrative momentum. The structure creates a satisfying arc from the pool to the carnival and back, with clear causality throughout. The time travel framework intelligently supports the central conflict about regret and repetition. While compact, the story maintains coherence without feeling rushed, though the resolution feels slightly abbreviated compared to the richly developed setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, blending concrete and abstract elements into a cohesive reality. The sky reflection pool, hologram crowds, and prismatic floorboards create a dreamlike yet tactile setting. The post-time-travel society where "regrets loop back on themselves like bitten tails" establishes profound atmospheric weight. Sensory details are precise and evocative - "shoes clicking on prismatic floorboards that rippled like trapped rainbows" - creating immersive dimensionality without excessive exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its sustained metaphorical framework around gravity, orbits, and reflection. Recurring imagery of mirrors, spirals, and weight creates thematic cohesion about the cyclical nature of desire and regret. The parallel between Corva and her client provides emotional resonance and subtext, suggesting we're all trapped in similar patterns. The language is consistently precise and evocative, with lines like "voice a velvet scalpel" demonstrating masterful craft. The ending creates lingering impact through its elegant understatement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates genuine originality in its approach to time travel and emotional counseling. The metaphorical consistency (gravity, orbits, reflections) feels intentional rather than algorithmic. The prose occasionally risks becoming overly ornate ("luminous cage of illusions"), but generally maintains balance between lyricism and clarity. The emotional complexity feels authentically human, showing rather than telling how regret and desire operate. Some phrases like "cautious impulsiveness" recur slightly mechanically, but the overall vision and execution remain distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous required elements, weaving them into an organic whole. The short form feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each sentence carrying narrative weight. The imaginative integration of abstract concepts (desire's gravity) with concrete objects (amber earrings) demonstrates creative sophistication. The lingering question about Corva's own orbit creates meaningful resonance beyond the story's conclusion. What prevents a higher score is occasional moments where the language becomes slightly too dense, potentially obscuring rather than illuminating meaning.</comment>
