<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ellis's characterization as a groggy brewer is consistent and informs his actions throughout. His motivation to embody values works well with his profession metaphors (brewing as protest, carbonation as defiance). His voice is distinctive with brewing terminology coloring his perspective, though his philosophical shift feels somewhat abrupt. The connection between his profession and his quest adds depth, but his transformation could use more groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with Ellis's journey from hangover to purposeful action. The discoloration method drives the central confrontation effectively. While there's coherence between beginning and end, some transitions feel rushed, particularly Ellis's sudden understanding of the handprint's significance. The brewing metaphors nicely parallel his personal journey, but the resolution happens too quickly without adequate buildup of stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard creates a rich atmosphere that perfectly balances the supernatural with social commentary. Sensory details like "dust puffing under each uncertain step" and the "dull chime" effectively immerse readers. The contrast between the protest outside and the supernatural encounter inside creates compelling tension. The brewing metaphors cleverly extend into the setting descriptions, creating a cohesive world where physical and metaphorical elements merge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story skillfully uses brewing as an extended metaphor for moral courage and conviction. The mirror shard's reflection of darkness rather than self cleverly symbolizes societal reflection. The ending satisfies by bringing Ellis's internal journey back to the external protest. While the theme of embodying one's values resonates, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by overreliance on brewing terminology that occasionally feels forced rather than revealing deeper meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brewing metaphors show originality, but occasionally veer into purple prose ("his gait still zigzagged like a drunk line of verse"). The dialogue is limited but authentic. Some phrases feel overly crafted ("flippant solemnity clung to him the way last night's hops clung to his beard"), drawing attention to the writing rather than advancing the story. The narrative maintains consistent tone, though the protagonist's swift transformation from hungover to heroic lacks nuanced emotional development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive narrative about finding conviction. The brewing metaphors provide thematic unity, though occasionally overworked. The supernatural confrontation effectively mirrors the protest's purpose. The short format works well for this character moment, though some transitions feel compressed. The ending leaves readers with the satisfying image of personal transformation fueling collective action, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
