<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Silas and Aurelia emerge as distinctive characters whose motivations (tracking butterflies, scientific collaboration) evolve naturally. Their personalities are conveyed through actions rather than exposition. The unconventional love develops organically through their shared scientific purpose. However, we could benefit from more insight into their inner conflicts and backgrounds to make their connection feel more earned rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Silas's initial dilemma (tracking butterflies with a dry pen) to the collaboration with Aurelia and their joint mission. The Morse code communication drives the story forward elegantly, and cause-effect relationships are logical. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the transition from adversaries to collaborators feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly realized through sensory details—rattling portholes, hissing steam, brass components. The atmosphere perfectly complements the themes of hidden communication and scientific discovery amid political tension. The "between broken treaties" timeframe creates a compelling backdrop that justifies both characters' actions and enhances the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through fresh imagery ("piston sighs"), meaningful symbolism (butterflies representing political change), and thematic depth (knowledge as power, collaboration across division). The central conflict resolves satisfyingly when the characters choose altruism over profit. The prose consistently shows rather than tells, particularly in how their relationship develops through actions. Some metaphors occasionally border on overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story exhibits considerable originality in its steampunk political intrigue framework and the metaphor of radium butterflies predicting imperial collapse. Most descriptions avoid clichés with specific, unusual details. However, certain phrases ("love is the fairest sabotage") feel slightly manufactured for profundity, and some sentences grow overloaded with adjectives and clauses that slightly diminish authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its diverse assigned elements into a cohesive whole where each component serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The steampunk setting, political backdrop, and central relationship work in harmony to create a surprisingly immersive world in limited space. The emotional resonance of scientific collaboration transforming into connection leaves a lingering impression, though some sentences could benefit from tighter construction.</comment>
