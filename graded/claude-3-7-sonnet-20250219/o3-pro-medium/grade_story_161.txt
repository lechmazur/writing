<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Florian Derwent is compellingly rendered through his punctuality, meticulous routines, and trauma (the orchard/brother accident). His vigilance as an orchardist effectively transfers to his conspiracy investigation. The character's sardonic glee gives him a distinctive voice that feels authentic against his tragic background. His motivation stems clearly from personal tragedy, though the exact connection between his brother's death and the pulp conspiracy could be more explicitly linked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from Florian's preparation to his demonstration of the conspiracy, with the peacock pattern effectively visualizing his evidence. However, the narrative feels somewhat compressed at the climax, where the revelation happens quickly without allowing full impact. The connection between the orchard background and paper airplane facility feels somewhat forced, though the metaphorical parallels (crash-logging, truth "crumpling") create thoughtful connections.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility provides a unique, vivid setting that ingeniously connects to both the conspiracy (paper pulp) and Florian's orchard background (natural elements against mechanical). The atmosphere balances technical precision with natural imagery, creating an effective contrast that mirrors Florian's character. Sensory details like "churning hangar air" and "topiary" beside wind tunnels create a distinct world where the sardonic tone can flourish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story excels in its metaphorical depthâ€”the recurring motifs of flight, falling, and growing create a rich subtext. The peacock imagery works both literally and symbolically, with each "eye" corresponding to evidence points. The narrative skillfully uses figurative language ("anxiety fledglings," "truth into flight") that elevates the conspiracy plot beyond its surface. The emotional resolution where Florian feels grief "loosen its chokehold" provides satisfying catharsis without becoming sentimental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates substantial originality in its unusual setting combination and the peacock pattern reveal mechanism. The prose avoids generic AI patterns through specific, unexpected phrases ("sardonic glee crackled," "bakery of truth") and consistent characterization. However, some metaphors become slightly overwrought ("harvested something that would not bruise") and the conspiracy explanation occasionally relies on exposition rather than organic revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its diverse elements into a coherent narrative with distinctive style and voice. The peacock pattern demonstration provides an innovative focal point that unifies the character's background, motivation, and action. While occasionally the prose becomes overly elaborate, the story maintains a compelling through-line and creates genuine emotional resonance in Florian's journey from grief to purposeful action. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining the established sardonic tone.</comment>
