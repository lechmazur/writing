<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Midori is well-developed for such a short piece. Her dutiful scholar attribute manifests both in her academic position and in her methodical approach to breaking rules. Her motivation to preserve erased poetry creates a compelling tension between duty to authority and duty to art. The unspoken heart concept shapes her internal conflict beautifully. The character possesses clear, consistent motivation that drives every action. A slightly more distinctive voice might elevate this further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot builds with exceptional precision and coherence. The contamination action drives everything forward with clear cause-effect relationships. The journey from capsule hotel to ancient well and back forms a complete arc with logical progression. The method of capturing forbidden poetry through echoes is conceptually integrated with the world-building. Nothing feels rushed despite the ambitious scope, and each element connects meaningfully to create a satisfying narrative journey with a resonant conclusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The futuristic capsule hotel juxtaposed with ancient Edo creates a rich temporal contrast that perfectly serves the story's themes. Sensory details are exceptionalâ€”the "neon and forgotten blossoms" air, the "corridor hum," the "moonlit well." The atmosphere seamlessly blends technological sterility with poetic beauty, reinforcing the central conflict. The setting isn't merely backdrop but a thematic element that amplifies Midori's mission to restore beauty to a clinical world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable impact through layered literary craft. Metaphors like "history without poetry was a sterile river where no soul could drink" resonate powerfully. The central conflict between sterile authority and dangerous beauty creates meaningful tension. The ending delivers emotional resonance with the image of "secret wind" and souls lifting. The prose demonstrates masterful "showing" through sensory details and evocative imagery rather than telling. The theme of art's necessity despite risk emerges organically and leaves the reader with lingering questions about the value of controlled versus authentic history.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its fusion of time travel mechanics with poetic preservation. The prose occasionally veers toward purple territory with lines like "reality folded politely" or "tears welled...from the sudden expansion of rooms she had kept locked." While these moments risk becoming overwrought, they generally serve the story's atmosphere. The emotional resonance feels earned rather than stated. The consistent tone and unique concept of "narrative energy" and memory preservation through poetry demonstrate creative imagination beyond formulaic approaches, though some metaphors could be more surprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite its complex elements and constraints. The assigned elements feel integral rather than forced, particularly the wire coil and the concept of contamination. The prose strikes an effective balance between lyrical and clear. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying narrative weight. The story leaves the reader with powerful questions about the value of art versus order, the nature of preservation, and the courage required to fight for beauty in sterile systems. A few moments of slightly overwritten prose prevent a higher score, but overall this is an impressive achievement.</comment>
