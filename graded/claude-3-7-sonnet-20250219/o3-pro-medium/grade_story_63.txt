<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mari's character as a reserved oracle is well-established through her careful, attentive actions. Her motivation to preserve art flows naturally from her grandmother's influence. The embroidered cuffs effectively serve as both physical artifact and emotional connection, revealing her reverence for tradition. Her "humbly proud" attribute manifests organically in her quiet determination and modest gestures when sharing the restored lullaby. The character lacks some deeper internal conflict that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc: Mari's secret mission during choir practice, the challenge of incomplete notation, the process of reconstruction, and the triumphant sharing of the restored lullaby. The mending action drives the narrative effectively, with the wallpaper scrawls creating a logical method of discovery. The story achieves satisfying resolution within its constraints. The pacing occasionally feels slightly rushed during the technical aspects of sound restoration, but maintains coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is brilliantly realized through specific sensory detailsâ€”copper corridors, clinking test tubes, squeaking reeds. The setting perfectly complements both the action (mending) and concept (ripple effects of sound). The atmosphere balances technical precision with mystical elements, creating a unique world where science meets artistry. The choir practice timeframe creates natural tension and cover for Mari's mission while providing auditory richness to the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of preservation, legacy, and the healing power of art. The ripple metaphor extends beautifully from the embroidered waves to the actual sound effects. Strong imagery connects stitching/mending with sound restoration. The ending delivers emotional payoff through both external validation (the choir's response) and personal connection (grandmother's spiritual presence). The story effectively "shows" emotional impact through physical reactions to the lullaby rather than telling about feelings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story displays originality in its premise of a sound laboratory and the concept of "mending" music. Sensory details are specific and evocative rather than generic. The prose occasionally verges on purple ("melody simple as candle flame") but generally maintains purposeful elegance. There's genuine emotional resonance in Mari's connection to her grandmother and the collective response to the lullaby. The metaphors connecting stitching to sound restoration feel fresh and purposeful rather than formulaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous required elements. The laboratory setting, oracle character, embroidered cuffs, and mending action all feel essential rather than forced. The ripple effect concept unifies the narrative thematically. The story creates lingering emotional resonance through its exploration of art preservation across generations. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence advancing both plot and thematic depth. A few moments of slightly overwrought language prevent a higher score.</comment>
