<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's secretive pathfinder nature drives her actions convincingly, and her motivation to preserve folk medicines creates a clear throughline. The "angrily peaceful" attribute manifests effectively as "a storm contained within a deceptively still surface." Her unique encoding method reveals both her intellect and dedication. However, the character would benefit from more specific personal stakes or a deeper exploration of why she alone pursues this preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from the protagonist's regular routine to the collision with Hemlock and the revelation about her music disturbing spirits. The hug action functions effectively as both resolution and symbol. The story achieves a complete arc despite constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships. However, the transition to the resolution feels slightly rushed, and the protagonist's decision to change her methods could have been given more dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with "decaying rides," "overgrown heart," and the ghost train's "hollow whistle." The atmosphere brilliantly supports both the preservation theme and the character's solitary nature. Sensory details like the "spectral chill," "static charge," and "oppressive chill" create a palpable mood that enhances the otherworldly elements while maintaining narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the teapot's cracks as a metaphor for "fragility and resilience," creating thematic resonance. The connection between preserving forgotten remedies and appeasing forgotten spirits provides meaningful subtext. The story prompts reflection on preservation, knowledge, and respecting the past. However, the emotional impact of the encounter could be intensified, and the dialogue from Hemlock feels slightly explanatory rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unusual combination of elements—folk medicine preservation via music hacking in a haunted setting. The prose avoids clichés and creates a distinctive atmosphere. However, some descriptions feel overly ornate ("fiercely protective, an aloof passion"), and there's occasional reliance on telling rather than showing emotional states. The character's reactions sometimes follow predictable patterns rather than offering surprising depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates multiple disparate elements into a cohesive whole with a clear thematic through-line about preservation. The brief length feels purposeful rather than constrained. The emotional resonance between the protagonist and Hemlock creates a meaningful moment that transcends the supernatural elements. The lingering thought about "a quieter kind of preservation" provides satisfying closure while suggesting deeper implications.</comment>
