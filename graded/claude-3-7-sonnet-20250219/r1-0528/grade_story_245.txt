<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's character is well-developed through his emotional journey from fury to purposeful resolve. His motivation to find the waterfalls functions both literally and metaphorically as escape and rebirth. The connection to his dead partner Lys adds meaningful depth, and his relationship with the chopstick as a memento effectively reveals his inability to let go. However, his transformation from vengeance-seeker to purposeful hunter feels slightly rushed, preventing a truly profound character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot effectively moves from Kael's directionless anger to focused purpose, with the tea leaf reading providing a clever turning point. The jogging action propels him both physically and emotionally through the narrative. The beginning and end connect well, creating a satisfying micro-arc within the word constraint. However, the cause-effect relationship between betrayal and seeking waterfalls initially feels tenuous, and the pacing compresses too much backstory into too little space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting brilliantly mirrors Kael's emotional desolation with vivid details like "fractured permacrete" and "listing cargo gantry." The contrast between the mechanical decay and the natural purity of the sought-after waterfalls creates compelling tension. Sensory elements—the metallic taste of anger, the bitterness of the tea, the warmth of the chopstick—are particularly strong, immersing readers in both the physical space and Kael's interior landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storytelling effectively employs symbolism (the single chopstick representing brokenness, tea leaves as divination) and creates emotional resonance through grief and determination. The central theme of finding meaning after loss is powerfully conveyed without being heavy-handed. The narrative shows rather than tells Kael's emotional state through physical sensations and actions. The ending achieves a satisfying sense of purpose without resolving everything, leaving space for the reader's imagination.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in how it combines space opera elements with intimate grief. The description of anger as "the heart's revolt" with specific physical manifestations feels fresh and insightful. Language remains evocative without becoming purple prose. The tea leaf reading avoids cliché through its connection to the lost partner's character. Minor weaknesses include some predictability in the emotional arc and occasional overreliance on adjectives that slightly diminish the raw impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the constraints. The spaceport setting, chopstick, and tea leaves feel integral rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating an intense character study within a compact space. The emotional and philosophical implications—how we memorialize lost loved ones, finding direction through grief—extend beyond the narrative's explicit bounds, giving the piece lasting resonance despite minor flaws in pacing and exposition.</comment>
