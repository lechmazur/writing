<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlo's characterization is well-developed through his vigilant nature transferred from orchard work to investigation. His grief gives him depth and motivation, while his methodical approach feels authentic for his profession. The "cold, focused blade" of his resolve effectively illustrates his transformation. However, his emotional journey could be more subtly revealed rather than explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from discovery to investigation to resolution with strong causality. The demonstration of the sabotage method creates a satisfying investigative arc. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the peacock pattern forming an elegant connecting thread between the damaged wing and the antique seal. The resolution feels earned rather than contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility contrasts effectively with Arlo's orchard background, creating tension between natural and technological worlds. Sensory details like "crunching gravel" and the "sterile hum" establish atmosphere economically. The facility's clinical environment amplifies the emotional undercurrents. However, some setting elements could be more distinctively rendered to elevate beyond functional description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story employs sophisticated symbolism through the peacock pattern and damaged wings as metaphors for both sabotage and fragility. The narrative shows rather than tells Arlo's emotional state through his actions and observations. The ending resonates with thematic weight through the apple metaphor. The story invites reflection on grief, justice, and patterns both hidden and revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates originality in how it interweaves technical elements with emotional resonance. The prose avoids generic descriptions, employing specific details like "worn velvet pouch" and comparisons to "a particularly tart apple." However, certain phrasings ("sardonic glee" appears twice) and the somewhat predictable investigative structure reveal minor formulaic tendencies. The emotional trajectory follows expected patterns without major surprises.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story integrates its diverse elements remarkably well, creating a coherent narrative where each assigned component serves the whole rather than feeling forced. The investigation framework elegantly incorporates both character background and the technical setting. While the conclusion provides satisfaction, it leans toward conventionality. The story demonstrates skillful compression of a complete arc within tight constraints, leaving readers with provocative connections between patterns, grief, and justice.</comment>
