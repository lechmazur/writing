<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's character as a professional cuddler shapes her perspective on touch and connection in meaningful ways. Her motivation to gain her father's acceptance is clear and consistent. The phantom punch becomes an effective metaphor for her work's value. However, we could benefit from more insight into Elara's internal life beyond her relationship with her father to make her fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the market to the confrontation with her father, using the phantom punch as a powerful linking device. The chance encounter that introduces the object is elegantly woven into the narrative. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with her father's changed perspective happening too quickly to be entirely convincing within the established tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar creates a rich atmosphere that parallels the story's themes of outdated judgments and forgotten connections. The contrast between decaying industrial grandeur and glittering social event effectively mirrors the tension between Elara's world and her father's. Sensory details like the "scent of ozone" and "skeletal giants" create vivid immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the phantom punch as both literal object and metaphor for connection, creating layers of meaning. The parallel between the decaying spaceport and crumbling prejudice demonstrates thoughtful symbolism. The emotional confrontation between father and daughter carries genuine weight. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, particularly in explaining the significance of Elara's profession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and purposeful language. The metaphors connecting the punch to human connection are fresh. However, there are moments of slightly purple prose ("skeletal giants," "ethereal glow"), and some phrases like "the hangar seemed to hold its breath" lean toward clich√©. The character reasoning sometimes feels too explicitly stated rather than revealed through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole, using the unusual combination of professional cuddling and phantom objects to explore themes of connection and acceptance. The brief length works as a snapshot of a pivotal moment rather than feeling constrained. The story leaves readers with the lingering question of whether true understanding between Elara and her father is possible, suggesting depth beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
