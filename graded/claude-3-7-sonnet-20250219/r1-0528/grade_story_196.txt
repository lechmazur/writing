<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tired swordsman's character is developed primarily through his inner conflict rather than actions or dialogue. His fierce apathy contrasts effectively with his hidden promise and defiance. The character's motivation to escape spiritual stagnation is clear, though his personality could be more distinctly revealed through concrete choices rather than internal states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from resignation to action, with the meteor shower providing both literal and metaphorical guidance. The story achieves completeness within its constraints, with the protagonist's journey from weariness to purposeful action clearly mapped. The transition from empty bag to meaningful container mirrors the character's transformation effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery creates a distinctive setting that enhances the mystical tone. The stark contrast between the enclosed monastery and the vast cosmos creates tension that mirrors the protagonist's inner conflict. Sensory details—particularly visual elements like the "star-punctured void" and "silver scratch on night's canvas"—create an immersive atmosphere that balances cosmic grandeur with intimate human experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the bag as a symbol of emptiness transformed to purpose, and the meteor shower as both literal guide and metaphor for revelation. The narrative shows rather than tells the character's transformation, though the ending relies somewhat heavily on direct explanation of its themes. The central conflict between spiritual emptiness and meaningful purpose is well-developed, with effective use of imagery connecting cosmic events to personal awakening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids major clichés, some phrasing feels overwrought ("fierce apathy," "knowing naivety"). The metaphors are generally fresh, particularly those connecting cosmic phenomena to inner experience. However, some sentences become overly complex, creating a slightly artificial rhythm. The story demonstrates creativity in its concept but occasionally slips into excessive explanation of its symbolism rather than allowing it to emerge naturally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements cohesively, particularly in how the meteor shower serves both plot and symbolic functions. The floating monastery setting enhances rather than distracts from the core narrative of personal awakening. While occasionally overwritten, the prose generally supports the mystical tone. The story creates an effective emotional arc within its constraints, though it could trust readers more to interpret its symbolism without explanation.</comment>
