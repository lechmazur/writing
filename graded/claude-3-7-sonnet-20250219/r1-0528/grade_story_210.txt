<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-portrayed as an amiable scholar through both explicit characterization and his actions. His quiet patience, intellectual curiosity, and respectful approach to the ghosts demonstrate consistency with his scholarly nature. His motivation to connect past wisdom with modern understanding drives his actions throughout the narrative. However, his character could benefit from slightly more distinctive dialogue or personal quirks to elevate him beyond his archetypal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a satisfying arc within its constraints - from waiting to validation. The vibration action effectively drives the narrative, connecting the physical sensation to the story's thematic core. While the plot structure is sound, with clear causality between the haunted timbers' vibrations and Elias's project approval, the transition between the pigeon's arrival and the reading of the message feels slightly rushed, sacrificing some emotional impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptional - richly developed and integral to the story's meaning. The atmosphere seamlessly blends physical and metaphysical elements, with vivid sensory details like "dust-moted gloom" and timbers that "thrummed with more than just the wind." The lighthouse as a beacon built from shipwreck creates a powerful symbolic framework that enhances both the narrative and thematic elements. The setting and concept of navigating shadows are masterfully intertwined.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of wisdom preserved through tragedy. Literary devices are effectively employed, particularly the extended metaphor of illumination cutting through darkness. The ending delivers satisfying resolution while maintaining thematic depth. The narrative skillfully shows rather than tells Elias's emotional journey. The central conflict between dismissal of the past and its preservation is well-developed, though the story occasionally relies on somewhat abstract language that slightly diminishes its immediate impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, demonstrating originality in its premise and execution. The metaphors are fresh, particularly the lighthouse as "a beacon of hope constructed from a vessel of despair." However, occasional phrases like "profound relief and vindication washed over him" veer toward familiar territory. The emotional handling is generally nuanced, showing Elias's reactions through physical sensations and measured responses rather than stated emotions. Some passages contain slightly ornate language that, while not purple prose, occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The lighthouse setting, vibrating timbers, and scholarly protagonist work in harmony to create a meaningful narrative about honoring the past while moving forward. The brief length feels appropriate for the single emotional arc portrayed. The story's greatest strength is its thematic depth - the idea that what appears haunted may actually be wisdom seeking recognition resonates beyond the immediate narrative. Some minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent a higher score.</comment>
