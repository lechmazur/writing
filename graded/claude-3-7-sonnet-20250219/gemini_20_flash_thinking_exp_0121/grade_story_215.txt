<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "rattled exorcist" characterization is established well initially, but Thomas's transformation from rattled to calm feels rushed. His inward sociality is mentioned but not deeply explored. His motivation to entwine science with wonder is clear and consistent, driving his actions throughout. The character lacks a truly distinctive voice in dialogue, with only one brief line that doesn't reveal much personality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the puzzle-solving action to drive the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from Thomas's arrival to his revelation. The connection between the beginning (arrival with postcard) and end (finding identical postcard) creates satisfying symmetry. However, the puzzles themselves feel somewhat generic rather than specific to the setting, and the final "choice" remains ambiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is vividly established with strong sensory details - the "humming" energy, "vibrating" air, and the incongruous waltz music create a compelling atmosphere of scientific sterility mixed with supernatural unease. The contrast between the facility's cold logic and the hidden altar effectively supports the theme of science meeting faith. The vintage postcard connects meaningfully to both the setting and the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the tension between faith and science, creating a thematic depth that transcends its plot. The symmetry of the postcards and the revelation in the hidden room provide a satisfying conclusion that prompts reflection. The writing shows rather than tells through atmospheric details and character reactions. However, the dialogue is minimal, and some metaphors ("a riddle wrapped in quantum physics") feel somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids many AI hallmarks but contains some overly ornate phrasing ("the air vibrated not just with scientific instruments, but something else, something akin to a poorly suppressed scream"). The puzzles are described in somewhat generic terms rather than with specific, vivid details. The emotional journey from "rattled" to "strangely calm" feels stated rather than fully demonstrated. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear thematic purpose. The synthesis of faith and science creates depth beyond the explicit plot. However, some elements (like the dance lessons) remain peripheral rather than integral to the story's development. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate, but generally supports the mysterious atmosphere. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining appropriate ambiguity.</comment>
