<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-developed through his paradoxical nature (elegantly clumsy) and his unique ability to see ghosts. His motivation to understand rather than banish the ghosts reveals depth. However, his emotional journey could be more nuanced, and his voice lacks distinctive qualities that would make him truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elias's ghost-seeing to his discovery of the flower crown and subsequent investigation. The "dissection" action drives the narrative forward logically. However, the resolution feels somewhat theoretical rather than achieved, with too many "perhaps" statements creating a sense of incompleteness despite the word constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a compelling metaphorical setting that beautifully parallels the story's themes of preserving ephemeral beauty. The atmosphere of quiet, haunted spaces (elevator shafts, the lab) effectively supports the "dissonance of silence" concept. Sensory details could be more specific, but the overall atmosphere is evocative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (preserved sand castles, dried flowers) to explore themes of impermanence and memory. The central conflict of Elias seeking understanding of his ghostly visions is clear. However, the ending relies too heavily on hypotheticals rather than providing a definitive emotional payoff, and some metaphors (like "dissecting" the crown) remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally relies on predictable ghost story elements. The prose sometimes becomes overly ornate ("complex simplicity," "dissonant silence") without fully earning these phrases through concrete detail. Character reasoning follows logical patterns without the messiness of human emotion, and the ending falls into a somewhat formulaic pattern of hopeful possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The connection between the protagonist's ghost-seeing and the flower crown creates an intriguing central mystery. However, the story's impact is diminished by its reliance on hypothetical connections rather than definitive revelations, and some elements (like the lunch breaks) feel perfunctory rather than essential.</comment>
