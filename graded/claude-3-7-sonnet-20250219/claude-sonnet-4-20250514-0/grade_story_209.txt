<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thomas's characterization as a woodsman whose mapping obsession masks his desperate search for a supernatural way to reconnect with his dying wife creates a compelling emotional core. His deception and eventual confession reveal significant internal conflict, though his personality could be more distinctly rendered through specific mannerisms or more distinctive dialogue patterns. His relationship with Martha, while emotionally resonant, relies somewhat on telling rather than showing their history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure skillfully weaves Thomas's dual quest - mapping railways while secretly searching for electromagnetic anomalies - into a coherent emotional journey that culminates in both acceptance and release. The progression from deception to honesty creates a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The plot's supernatural elements are integrated naturally with the emotional core, though the exact mechanics of how the electromagnetic field connects to Martha could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The radio wave garden with its transmission towers and electromagnetic phenomena creates a hauntingly unique setting that perfectly embodies the story's themes of connection, communication, and the barriers between worlds. The juxtaposition of natural elements (wildflowers) with abandoned technology creates a liminal space that reinforces the story's exploration of boundaries between life and death. Sensory details like the visible aurora-like patterns and the towers' hum create immersive atmosphere that elevates the emotional impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of grief, guilt, and acceptance. The electromagnetic field serves as both literal setting and powerful metaphor for the connections that transcend death. The prose balances lyrical description with emotional directness, particularly in lines like "some railways lead not to destinations, but to acceptance." While the supernatural elements work well symbolically, the story could further develop the specific emotional catharsis Thomas experiences beyond the brief moment of connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns through its specific, unconventional setting and emotionally nuanced portrayal of grief. Phrases like "that particular blend of despairing cheer that sustains those who refuse to surrender hope" demonstrate psychological insight beyond formulaic writing. The electromagnetic metaphors feel fresh rather than generic. The only mild weaknesses are occasional instances of telling emotional states rather than showing them, and some transitions between paragraphs could be more organically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>This story succeeds in weaving disparate elements (woodsman, radio waves, hairbrush) into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The supernatural premise serves the emotional core rather than feeling gimmicky. The exploration of grief through metaphor shows creative thinking, though occasionally the prose edges toward the ornate. The ending achieves poignancy without sentimentality, leaving the reader with the lingering impact of Thomas's emotional journey from deception to acceptance.</comment>
