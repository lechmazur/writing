<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's character is well-developed through her connection to lighthouse traditions and her relationship to her grandmother. The "aggressively kind" attribute manifests in her determination to help others despite physical limitations. However, we don't see enough internal conflict or complexity to make her fully three-dimensional, and her voice remains somewhat distant despite being the focal point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Eleanor's whistle-blowing to the rescue operation, creating a satisfying narrative arc. The integration of past traditions with present action works well. However, the timeframe element (dancer's foot) feels artificially inserted rather than integral to the plot structure, and the cause-effect relationship between Eleanor's actions and the boat's salvation could be more explicitly developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly realized with sensory details like "salt-stained windows" and the whale's call. The atmosphere skillfully blends mystical elements with maritime reality, creating a liminal space between past and present. The juxtaposition of ancient methods against modern technology creates a compelling atmosphere that enhances the thematic elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the theme of preserving ancient wisdom in a technological age. The metaphorical connection between Eleanor's work and the dancer creates meaningful subtext. The imagery of sound (whistles, horns, whale songs) is consistently powerful. However, the emotional stakes could be heightened to create greater tension, and the resolution feels slightly rushed despite the beautiful final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI pitfalls, there are moments of overly formal language ("brazen calm that masked decades of preparation") and some generic phrasing. The final paragraph veers into somewhat predictable philosophical territory about "interconnectedness" rather than showing this through more specific detail. The metaphors, while effective, occasionally feel slightly generic rather than sharply original.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The maritime setting and Eleanor's character work particularly well together. However, the dancer timeframe element feels forced, and some of the philosophical observations in the final paragraph tell rather than show the story's message. Overall, it demonstrates strong craft but falls short of exceptional literary quality.</comment>
