<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus is developed primarily through his profession and contradictory nature (using social media to free people from it). His motivation to find "genuine connection" amid digital performance is clear, though his internal conflict could be more deeply explored. The "quietly loud" attribute effectively shapes his performance style, but his emotional depth remains somewhat surface-level, with more telling than showing of his inner state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "reignite" action through both literal burning and metaphorical awakening. The structure moves coherently from setup to ritual to aftermath with appropriate pacing. The story achieves a complete arc despite brevity, creating a satisfying circular structure by returning to silence. However, the climactic moment lacks sufficient tension, and the connection between receipt-burning and digital liberation feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall creates a powerful atmosphere of decay that perfectly mirrors the theme of digital erosion. The contrast between digital ephemera and physical deterioration is deftly handled. Sensory details like "peeling paint," "flickering candle," and "smoke curled upward through broken rafters" effectively immerse the reader. The transition from music hall to mess hall creates a coherent spatial progression that enhances the ritualistic atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the paradox of seeking authenticity through performance. The theme of digital alienation is well-developed through concrete imagery rather than abstraction. The central metaphor of "exorcism" from digital personas carries significant weight. The ending leaves readers with the haunting realization that genuine connection remains elusive despite ritualistic efforts. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat theoretical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story shows originality in its concept of "social media exorcist" and avoids most common AI writing pitfalls. The paradoxical phrases ("indifferent enthusiasm," "familiar strangers") feel purposeful rather than accidental. However, some descriptions rely on telling rather than showing emotions ("Marcus felt both satisfied and empty"), and certain phrases like "genuine human connection" feel somewhat generic. The narrative voice maintains consistency but occasionally slips into overly formal phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores a contemporary theme with nuance. The parallel between abandoned physical spaces and hollow digital interactions creates meaningful resonance. While the concept is strong, the execution occasionally prioritizes thematic statement over emotional immersion. The brevity works well for the ritualistic structure, but limits deeper character development that would elevate the story's impact.</comment>
