<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's necromantic abilities effectively shape her actions and differentiate her from conventional scientists. Her determination despite academic ridicule establishes clear motivation. However, her character could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict between scientific and supernatural approaches. Jake remains somewhat underdeveloped beyond his connection to Maya.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent arc from discovery to revelation within tight constraints. The mapping action propels the narrative logically, though the "dominate" element feels somewhat forced. The connection between necromancy and geological mapping creates interesting tension, but the resolution feels slightly rushed without exploring the consequences of their discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is exceptionally well-realized through vivid sensory details that create an otherworldly atmosphere. The juxtaposition of scientific equipment against supernatural elements effectively establishes the tone. The environment becomes almost a character itself, with its "crystalline song" and "luminescent walls" creating a compelling backdrop that enhances both the action and character motivations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively blends scientific and supernatural elements to create thought-provoking tension. The metaphor of crossing boundaries works well thematically. Dialogue feels natural and purposeful. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by telling rather than showing Maya's connection to the dead, and the conflict between scientific orthodoxy and supernatural methods remains largely external rather than internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise combining necromancy and geology feels fresh, some phrases ("the dead didn't judge her methods") border on clich√©. The story shows originality in its concept but occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The writing maintains consistent tone throughout, though some descriptions ("cathedral of glass and starlight") verge on purple prose without adding substantive meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its diverse elements into a cohesive whole that examines the intersection of science and mysticism. The crystalline cave provides an effective canvas for exploring boundaries between rational and supernatural. While the brevity somewhat limits character depth, the story leaves the reader with intriguing questions about knowledge acquisition and academic orthodoxy. The writing occasionally becomes too ornate, but generally supports the otherworldly atmosphere.</comment>
