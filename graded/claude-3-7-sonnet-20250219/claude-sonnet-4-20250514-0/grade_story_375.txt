<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's transformation from saboteur to weapon is compelling, with her motivation rooted in personal tragedy. Her relationship with the mannequins shows character growth. However, her internal conflict could be more nuanced, and we get limited insight into her emotional complexity beyond rage and determination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from infiltration to transformation, with Elena's progress driving momentum. The connection between flashlight, mannequins, and cosmic revenge forms a coherent throughline. However, the middle section feels somewhat repetitive, and the resolution relies too heavily on tell-not-show about how the mannequins' power will work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The suspended radio tower creates a striking liminal space perfect for cosmic communication. The atmosphere of decay, isolation and celestial menace is consistently maintained with vivid details. The integration of cosmic forces with the physical setting creates a haunting, otherworldly quality that elevates the narrative beyond typical sci-fi.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the motif of broken things containing power, with strong imagery connecting cosmic forces to personal vengeance. The subversion of sabotage into salvation provides meaningful depth. However, the middle relies too heavily on repetitive statements about the mannequins' nature, and Elena's epiphany feels somewhat telegraphed rather than organically revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the cosmic revenge premise is inventive, the writing relies on repetitive phrasings about "broken things" and "perfect imperfection." The mannequins' abilities remain somewhat generic despite their centrality. There's an overreliance on adjectives like "weathered," "scuffed," and "damaged," and Elena's emotional journey follows predictable beats without truly surprising developments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a unique cosmic revenge plot. The imagery of broken conduits channeling stellar energy creates memorable visuals. However, the middle section becomes repetitive, the mechanism of revenge remains underdeveloped, and the prose occasionally sacrifices specificity for atmospheric description.</comment>
