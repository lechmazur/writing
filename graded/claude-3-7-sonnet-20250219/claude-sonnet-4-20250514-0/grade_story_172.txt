<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as an unsettled guide works well with her reluctance and fear surrounding the seashell. Her relationship with the prophecy and her grandmother provides good motivation, though her emotional journey from dread to acceptance feels slightly rushed. Her voice remains distinct, but could benefit from more personal introspection to fully reveal her transformation from reluctant guide to accidental hero.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly connects the puzzle box, prophecy, and Maya's grandmother's wisdom into a cohesive narrative that builds toward a satisfying resolution. The cause-and-effect relationships are logical, with Maya's understanding of "reversed wishes" providing an effective plot twist. The pacing effectively manages to establish stakes, present conflict, and reach resolution within the word limit without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The giant seashell setting is exceptionally well-realized with vivid details like "nacre-lined corridors" and architectural features that respond to touch and moonlight. The atmosphere of mystery and ancient magic is consistently maintained, while the transition from supernatural threat to ordinary beach creates an effective contrast that underscores Maya's triumph. The setting directly enhances both the action and the concept of architectural secrets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension through Maya's reluctance and the prophecy's implications, culminating in a satisfying subversion. The theme of outsmarting destiny rather than fleeing it resonates, and the grandmother's paradoxical wisdom adds depth. The narrative successfully shows rather than tells Maya's emotional journey. However, the resolution happens quickly, and the story would benefit from more nuanced exploration of the central conflict's implications.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls and presents a fresh take on prophecy narratives, some phrasing feels slightly formulaic ("sharp clarity tempered by gentle acceptance"). The concept of a giant architectural seashell feels original, but the execution of the prophecy follows somewhat predictable patterns. The emotional landscape could benefit from more specific, unexpected reactions rather than familiar beats of dread, acceptance and triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that doesn't feel forced. The concept of reversing wishes to outsmart a prophecy provides a compelling central idea that ties together character, setting, and object. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc despite its brief length, though it occasionally leans on familiar fantasy tropes. The lingering image of Maya walking toward genuine freedom provides emotional resonance beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
