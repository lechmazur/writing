<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-established through her conflict between family expectations and personal desires. Her interaction with the amber beetle creates a compelling parallel to her own situation. However, her communication with ghosts feels somewhat underdeveloped and her emotional journey, while clear, relies too heavily on direct statements rather than demonstrated growth through actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively weaves the letter-writing as a frame for Marina's internal conflict. The parallel between the trapped insect and Marina's own situation creates a coherent metaphorical thread. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though the "arousing" element feels somewhat artificially inserted rather than integral to the plot's momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery is vividly realized with sensory details like "salt-stained air" and "peeling paint." The setting powerfully amplifies the themes of abandonment, tradition, and transformation. The atmosphere successfully balances melancholy with hopeful rebellion, creating a liminal space that reflects Marina's emotional state and transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the amber as both literal object and metaphor, creating layered meaning. The theme of breaking free from expectations is well-developed, and the ending provides emotional satisfaction. However, the ghost communication aspect feels more told than shown, and some metaphors ("rebellion coursing through her veins like warm honey") border on clich√© rather than fresh insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the narrative avoids many AI hallmarks, certain phrases feel formulaic ("rebellion singing in her veins"). The emotional descriptions sometimes tell rather than show ("feeling rebelliously alive despite the melancholy"). The ghost elements, while interesting, follow predictable patterns without surprising the reader. The amber metaphor, though central, is somewhat heavy-handed in its application.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The amber-as-prison metaphor provides thematic depth, and the carnival setting creates a distinctive atmosphere. However, some elements feel more grafted onto the story than essential to it, and the ghost communication aspect, while intriguing, isn't fully realized in its implications.</comment>
