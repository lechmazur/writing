<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya is effectively developed as a methodical seer who perceives patterns rather than having supernatural abilities. Her analytical nature drives her actions consistently. Her unremarkable appearance contrasts nicely with her exceptional mind. However, we could benefit from more insight into her personal connection to Flight 447, which would deepen her motivation beyond professional curiosity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains excellent coherence from setup to revelation. The plot flows logically from party distraction to evidence retrieval to decryption. The "untangle" action drives the narrative perfectly as Maya methodically unravels corporate deception. The structure has a satisfying arc with the USB discovery as midpoint and file decryption as resolution, creating a complete narrative despite the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere creation through sensory details, particularly the petrichor scent that both guides Maya and symbolizes renewal. The abandoned control tower provides both literal and metaphorical elevation for truth-seeking. The contrast between celebratory party aftermath and serious investigation creates effective tension. Weather patterns mirror narrative progression brilliantly, with rain intensifying as revelations approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story effectively employs metaphor (rain washing away sins) and symbolism (constellations of data forming truth). The conflict between buried truth and corporate power is well-established. The theme of patient persistence yielding justice resonates strongly in the final lines. The writing consistently shows rather than tells, allowing Maya's actions to reveal her character. The ending delivers both resolution and a sense of continued purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The writing avoids most AI-typical patterns with varied sentence structures and consistent characterization. Some metaphors feel fresh (rain as "urgent morse code"), while sensory details are specific and purposeful. However, phrases like "tasting rain and redemption in equal measure" verge on purple prose, and the "quiet fire" in her eyes is somewhat clich√©d. The story sometimes tells emotional states directly rather than showing them through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative where each component serves the central theme of delayed justice. The contrast between the unremarkable protagonist and her remarkable persistence creates compelling tension. The petrichor as method is particularly well-integrated, serving both plot function and symbolic purpose. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with the story achieving both narrative completeness and thematic resonance.</comment>
