<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya is well-developed within the constraints, with her technical skill contrasting effectively with her emotional struggle. Her relationship with ghosts and her grandmother creates complexity, though her initial reluctance to help Dr. Hendricks could be better explained. Her "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests physically while revealing her emotional state. However, we need more insight into why she's so resistant to her ghost-seeing abilities to fully understand her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from elevator breakdown to water leak resolution, with the ghost guiding Maya's journey both physically and emotionally. The central conflict provides satisfying stakes and resolution. Maya's character arc from resistance to acceptance creates coherent emotional throughline connecting beginning and end. The cause-effect relationships are logical without feeling forced. The dissection of the elevator control system cleverly mirrors her emotional journey of taking things apart to understand them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a perfect metaphor for Maya's emotional journeyâ€”preserving what's fragile while acknowledging impermanence. Sensory details like water drips and scattered petals effectively build tension. The contrast between mechanical spaces (elevator) and delicate specimens enhances thematic resonance. The dissonance of silence is masterfully woven throughout as both literal description and emotional state. The atmosphere perfectly balances technical precision with ethereal mystery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional depth through its parallel of physical preservation and emotional release. The sand castles serve as a powerful central metaphor for impermanence. The ghost's purpose and Maya's transformation create meaningful closure. The writing shows rather than tells emotional states through physical details like "trembling hands" and "scattered petals." Some dialogue or deeper internal conflict might have added complexity, but the story effectively communicates its theme of honoring the past by letting go.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI hallmarks, with fresh metaphors like "silence deafening in the way that only broken machinery could achieve." Character reasoning shows human nuance in prioritizing preservation work over personal concerns. The emotional arc feels authentic rather than stated. However, a few phrases like "civilizations built grain by grain" and "profound acts of love" edge toward generic territory. The ghost's convenient appearance and immediate vanishing after problem resolution feels slightly formulaic. Overall, the writing shows individual style through its technical-mystical balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements seamlessly, creating a cohesive narrative where the unusual combination (ghosts, sand castles, elevators) feels natural rather than forced. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a focused emotional journey. The parallel between physical preservation and emotional release shows sophisticated thematic development. The story lingers effectively, leaving readers contemplating the balance between honoring the past and moving forward. A truly excellent short-form piece with only minor flaws in execution.</comment>
