<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kestra is well-developed through her solitary vigil and unwavering dedication to her lost homeland. Her motivation remains clear and consistent throughout—the preservation of her people's memory through defiant action. Her "trustworthy strangeness" is effectively portrayed through the locals' relationship with her, though we could benefit from seeing more of her direct interactions with others to fully appreciate this quality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence within the word constraint. The catapult mechanism drives the story forward logically and dramatically, transforming from lighthouse to temporal device with appropriate foreshadowing. The arc moves naturally from setup to climactic action to hopeful resolution, all while maintaining thematic consistency. The connection between the physical catapult and temporal manipulation is ingeniously executed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse that cuts through dimensions creates an immediately evocative setting that perfectly complements the concept of a time refugee. The atmospheric elements—the glow of the atom-core, the borrowed dawn, the stars' alignment—all enhance the otherworldly yet tangible quality of Kestra's world. Sensory details like the golden threads catching ethereal light create a richly immersive experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through its portrayal of loneliness, defiance, and hope. The tablecloth serves as a powerful symbol of memory and sacrifice. The narrative's subtext about preserving cultural memory in the face of erasure adds depth beyond the plot. The ending provides both resolution and forward momentum. The metaphor of widening a crack in history's wall is particularly effective, though some dialogue might have added another dimension to Kestra's character.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates originality in its sci-fi concepts and emotional core. The imagery—particularly the tablecloth dissolving into chronological essence—feels fresh and purposeful. However, occasional phrases like "unstoppable will" and "defiance would outlast time itself" veer toward familiar territory. The emotional portrayal generally shows rather than tells, particularly in moments like Kestra's smile at dawn, but could delve deeper into her interior experience beyond her determined actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, creating a world where a lighthouse that guides ships across dimensions feels as natural as a character who exists between heartbeats. The brevity works to its advantage, suggesting a much larger universe beyond its boundaries. The lingering image of a civilization being gradually restored through nightly ritual gives the piece resonance beyond its word count, though a slightly deeper exploration of Kestra's emotional journey might have elevated it further.</comment>
