<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mako is well-developed within the constraints. His transformation from victim to avenger creates a compelling arc, with clear motivation stemming from betrayal. The sea glass serves as both practical tool and emotional tether, revealing his calculated approach to justice. His dual identity as scientist and revenge-seeker is consistently portrayed. Could benefit from more distinct voice, but his actions and thoughts effectively reveal character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot effectively balances present action with backstory, creating a complete narrative arc despite brevity. The decoding work provides clear forward momentum while the black hole setting mirrors Mako's psychological state. Excellent cause-effect relationships establish why he's there and what he's working toward. The narrative achieves resolution through his acceptance of his new purpose, though some transitions between past and present feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory overlooking a black hole creates a visually striking and thematically resonant setting. The author skillfully uses the black hole's physics (gravitational lensing, light bending) as metaphors for Mako's situation. Sensory details are exceptional—the "silently audible hum," the aurora-like phenomena, and the warmth of the sea glass all create immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of transformation and justice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves substantial emotional impact through strong symbolism—particularly the parallels between black holes and personal transformation. The sea glass functions brilliantly as both plot device and metaphor. The ending effectively ties together personal and cosmic themes with the image of light being captured and bent to "serve new masters." Conflict is clearly established and the resolution feels earned. Shows rather than tells Mako's emotional journey through his actions and observations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI hallmarks through specific, consistent worldbuilding and a distinctive narrative voice. Metaphors relating to light, darkness, and cosmic phenomena feel purposeful rather than decorative. The sea glass device demonstrates creative integration of elements. Some phrasing occasionally veers toward the ornate ("radiance from his own black hole of doubt"), but remains mostly grounded in the character's perspective and the established tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A cohesive narrative that skillfully integrates assigned elements into a thematically rich revenge story. The science fiction setting enhances rather than overwhelms the personal narrative. The astronomical imagery serves the character's psychological journey well. Brief length feels appropriate for this moment-in-time narrative. The ending effectively resolves immediate tensions while suggesting a continuing mission, leaving readers with both satisfaction and curiosity about what comes next.</comment>
