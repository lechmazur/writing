<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's "uniquely literal" interpretation ability is well-integrated into her character and serves her purpose as an apprentice cartographer. Her literal mind becomes a strength rather than a limitation, allowing her to distinguish truth from deception. However, we get limited insight into her interior life beyond her functional role, and her "brazen calm" feels more told than shown through meaningful character moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the parsing of notes to the ultimate goal of finding water-bearing worlds. The structure flows logically from basement entry to discovery to future implications, creating a satisfying micro-arc. The connection between decoding star maps and humanity's salvation is clear and compelling, though the story could benefit from a more specific conflict or obstacle for Kira to overcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement is vividly realized and meaningfully connected to the post-water-war setting. The ghostly voices of "drowned souls" create atmospheric tension while reinforcing the story's themes. The combination of ancient technology (telegraph station) with futuristic purpose (finding water in space) creates a rich temporal layering that enhances the world-building without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively establishes stakes (humanity's survival) while creating intrigue through its decoding premise. The lighthouse as a beacon of hope provides apt symbolism. The writing creates a sense of cosmic significance in Kira's methodical work. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted, and the story would benefit from more showing of Kira's internal experience rather than reporting her actions and thoughts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic water scarcity premise feels familiar, but the combination of cartography, astronomy, and literal interpretation creates a distinctive angle. Phrases like "her brazen calm" and "the dead approve" feel somewhat stylized rather than organic. The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Kira's emotional state and the reaction of the spectral voices. Some descriptions ("the basement's stone walls seemed to pulse") resort to standard atmospheric tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates its assigned elements into a coherent whole with clear stakes and purpose. The world-building efficiently establishes both the historical context and future possibilities within the tight word count. The literal-minded protagonist provides an interesting lens for the narrative. However, the story would benefit from more specific, concrete details of Kira's decoding process and a more distinctive narrative voice to elevate it from competent to exceptional.</comment>
