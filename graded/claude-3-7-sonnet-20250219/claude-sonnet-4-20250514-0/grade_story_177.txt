<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Magdalena's character is defined by her rebellious streak and unique occupation, but her internal motivations could be more thoroughly explored. While her actions align with her established traits, her emotional depth remains somewhat underdeveloped. The connection between writing obituaries for the living and her pursuit of theatrical necromancy has intriguing potential that isn't fully realized in her characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively weaves the assigned elements into a coherent narrative with a satisfying arc. Magdalena's journey from the bookshelf to the hidden chamber creates logical progression. However, the transition between discovering the mask and understanding the organ's purpose feels slightly rushed, and some cause-effect relationships could be more explicitly established to strengthen the internal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The giant's abandoned library creates a richly atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the themes of forbidden knowledge and resurrection. Exceptional sensory details bring the environment to lifeâ€”leather spines "the size of coffins," books that "groan like ships in a storm," and the organ's pipes reaching "like the ribs of some metallic leviathan." The revolutionary backdrop effectively contextualizes Magdalena's personal rebellion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story succeeds in creating a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere with strong imagery and metaphor. The parallel between political revolution and Magdalena's artistic rebellion adds thematic depth. The conclusion effectively ties together the concepts of life, death, and art. However, the emotional impact could be heightened through more specific details about the spirits she manifests, allowing for deeper reader investment in her necromantic achievement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of theatrical necromancy and the integration of assigned elements. However, some metaphors ("books groaned like ships") feel slightly generic, and the prose occasionally becomes ornate without advancing character or plot. While the narrative has a distinct voice, certain descriptive passages risk becoming purple prose, particularly in the later paragraphs where emotional resonance is stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinctive voice and atmosphere. The concept of "obituaries for the living" paired with theatrical necromancy creates a compelling foundation. While the prose occasionally becomes overly ornate and some connections between elements could be more organically developed, the overall effect is memorable. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of art, death, and performance.</comment>
