<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magnus's characterization as a principled brewer fighting corporate powers is consistent and well-established. His motivation to create authentic ale that represents defiance is clear and drives his actions. However, his internal struggle could be more nuanced, and the "groggy" aspect feels secondary to his revolutionary spirit rather than integral to his character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Magnus's brewery struggles to his mission in the mansion, with his initiation of brewing revolutionary ale providing a satisfying arc. The mirror and staircase elements connect well to his transformation. However, the story slightly rushes the climactic brewing moment, leaving some plot mechanics underdeveloped regarding how exactly this ritual will translate to real-world change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard creates a potent atmosphere that mirrors Magnus's struggle against "corporate death" of small breweries. The setting's darkness contrasts beautifully with his quest for authentic creation. Particularly strong is how the protest's energy flows through the mansion's foundations, connecting the exterior world to Magnus's interior journey through evocative sensory imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brewing-as-revolution metaphor creates layered meaning throughout, with fermentation serving as an elegant symbol for transformation. The mirror's reflection of his fragmented identity is particularly effective. The story successfully shows rather than tells Magnus's emotional journey. While the ending provides thematic closure, it could deliver a more specific, impactful final image rather than generalizing about his newfound purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and thematic coherence. The brewing metaphors feel authentic rather than formulaic. However, phrases like "flippant solemnity" and "cobwebs and regret" edge toward purple prose, and the conclusion relies somewhat on telling rather than showing Magnus's transformation. The revolution-in-a-pint concept, while compelling, treads familiar territory in craft culture narratives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about artistic integrity and resistance. The brewing metaphor provides an effective framework that ties together the supernatural setting, the broken mirror symbolism, and the character's quest for authenticity. While occasionally veering into abstraction rather than concrete detail, the piece maintains a clear vision and leaves readers with meaningful reflections on the relationship between craft and values.</comment>
