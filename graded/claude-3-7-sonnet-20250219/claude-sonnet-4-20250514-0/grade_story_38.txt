<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as an insomniac poet is well-integrated and shapes her actions convincingly. Her motivation to expose corporate wrongdoing through art shows clear connection to her poetic sensibilities. However, the character lacks some psychological depth - her transformation from passive listener to activist happens somewhat abruptly, and we don't fully understand her internal struggle. Her distinct "voice" emerges more through the narrator's description than through direct characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "eliminate" action as both literal (corporations eliminating ecosystems) and metaphorical (Maya eliminating secrecy through exposure). The arc moves clearly from problem to decision to implied resolution, creating satisfying coherence despite the word constraint. However, the transition from hearing whispers to guerrilla art installation feels somewhat rushed, and the stakes could be more concretely established to heighten dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting brilliantly complements the "warnings in whispers" concept, creating an atmospheric backdrop that enhances both the supernatural elements and Maya's isolation. The subway timeframe creates effective momentum and symbolism as a transitional space. Sensory details like "grimy window," "rustled like autumn leaves," and the executives' drunken behaviors create vivid immersion. The juxtaposition of natural elements against corporate sterility reinforces thematic tensions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in presenting plants as witnesses with "collective memory." The central conflict between corporate greed and environmental preservation is well-established, with Maya's artistic response creating a compelling resolution. The theme of giving voice to the voiceless through art resonates emotionally. However, the narrative occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding Maya's emotional state, and some metaphors ("proof of future ghosts") feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh premise in Maya's botanical activism, some phrasing feels formulaic ("fierce commitment," "weapon against injustice"). The narrative occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The conceptual link between haunting whispers and corporate malfeasance is original, but the execution sometimes veers into predictable environmental narrative territory. The integration of elements is creative but occasionally strains credibility, particularly in how conveniently the executives reveal their plans.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements (haunted attic, subway, botanical samples, corporate villainy) into a cohesive narrative with environmental and artistic themes. The writing generally maintains good momentum and creates atmospheric tension. However, some connections feel convenient rather than organic, and the story occasionally sacrifices psychological complexity for thematic resonance. The ending effectively leaves readers with provocative questions about art as activism, though Maya's transformation could be more convincingly developed.</comment>
