<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's character is well-developed through her dual identities as a rational geographic scout and inherited somnambulist. Her sleepwalking isn't merely a condition but meaningfully connected to her grandmother's legacy and spiritual cartography. The tension between her "rational mind" and sleeping self creates compelling internal conflict. However, her "unapologetically humble" attribute feels more stated than demonstrated through specific interactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Elena's sleepwalking episodes to the discovery of her true purpose, creating a satisfying arc within the word limit. The narrative moves from mysterious nocturnal wanderings to revelation with excellent pacing. The connection between the fireflies and spiritual cartography provides a unique conceptual framework that ties everything together. The transition from confusion to understanding creates meaningful narrative progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is masterfully rendered with specific, evocative details like "moss-covered stone steps" and "damp air carrying whispers." The subterranean setting perfectly complements the theme of hidden knowledge and unconscious exploration. The glowing fireflies create a luminous atmosphere that physically manifests the boundary between seen and unseen worlds. The sensory details create immersive, almost tactile engagement with this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story succeeds in exploring profound themes about consciousness, inherited wisdom, and alternative forms of knowledge. The fireflies function beautifully as both literal specimens and metaphorical beacons, creating rich symbolism. The narrative effectively "shows" Elena's transformation through her interaction with the specimens rather than merely telling us about it. The ending leaves readers with a lingering sense of mysterious possibilities beyond conventional understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story presents an original concept in connecting sleepwalking to spiritual cartography. However, some phrases like "loaded curiosity finally found its target" and "daylight consciousness" feel slightly formulaic. The metaphor of mapping spiritual territories sometimes veers toward overly abstract language. The emotional resonance builds gradually and authentically, though certain transitions between scientific and mystical tones could be more seamless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion in weaving together complex elements into a meaningful whole. The concept of sleepwalking as spiritual navigation is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The brevity serves the dreamy, mysterious quality of the narrative. The juxtaposition of scientific methodology (specimen collection, labeling) with mystical experience creates intriguing tension, leaving readers with provocative questions about consciousness and inherited wisdom.</comment>
