<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Melody's impulsive performer nature is consistently portrayed through her spontaneous actions and perspective. Her whimsical character traits effectively drive her unusual approach to solving the family mystery. However, the interiority could be deeper—we understand what she does but less about her emotional complexity beyond the inherited mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Melody's tracking of shooting stars to the resolution of her family's historical wrong. The structure is coherent with a clear beginning (discovery of sheet music), middle (waiting for celestial alignment), and satisfying resolution (performance that rights the wrong). The pacing efficiently moves through this journey despite the word constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall create a powerful, evocative setting that enhances the mystical nature of Melody's mission. Sensory details—the trembling stones, the waterfall's roar shifting to resonance, the mist—create a vivid atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's tone of restless harmony and the transitional dusk timeframe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively establishes emotional stakes and delivers a satisfying resolution. The theme of artistic justice and inheritance resonates throughout. The image of Melody's performance with "colorful scarves billowing like festival banners" while stars "dance in rhythm" creates powerful visual symbolism. However, some passages rely on telling emotional states rather than fully dramatizing them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution occasionally relies on overly ornate language ("The waterfall's roar shifted into a deeper resonance") and predictable emotional descriptions. The celestial blessing feels somewhat formulaic, and phrases like "whimsical magic that flowed through her performer's heart" veer into purple prose. The premise and setting are nonetheless distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive atmosphere and emotional payoff. The central conceit—that music and magic can right historical wrongs where conventional means fail—provides thematic weight. Despite occasional stylistic excesses, the story achieves its emotional aims and leaves a lingering impression of artistic justice.</comment>
