<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character development is effectively woven through her relationship with the stones and her guarded personality. Her transformation from detached orphan to someone embracing change feels earned through the gravitational anomaly metaphor. The only weakness is that we learn more about her history than her specific desires or ambitions beyond survival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly connects the anomaly to Maya's emotional journey, with the gravitational shift serving as both literal action and metaphor. The arc from resistance to acceptance creates a satisfying resolution within the constraint. The story achieves remarkable coherence through the consistent metaphor of gravity/weightlessness as emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a unique, immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements Maya's emotional state. Physical weightlessness mirrors her psychological detachment in striking sensory detail. The garage setting works as both mundane anchor and portal to transformation, with objects floating to create vivid visual imagery of her internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through consistent gravitational metaphors that operate on multiple levels. The stones-as-constant-companions motif creates emotional resonance, while Mrs. Chen's message provides meaningful subtext about embracing change. The final image of Maya suspended between worlds achieves poetic resonance without becoming overwrought, leaving readers with a lasting impression of personal transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers, certain phrases ("her fingers found the familiar weight") and emotional transitions feel slightly formulaic. The gravitational metaphor, while effective, occasionally relies on expected descriptors ("fear shot through her chest like ice water"). The character's transformation follows a somewhat predictable arc, though the specific imagery of floating stones creates original moments that elevate the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates multiple elements into a cohesive whole centered on transformation and acceptance. The gravitational anomaly serves both plot and metaphorical functions brilliantly. While occasionally veering toward expected emotional beats, the piece demonstrates creative thinking in how it connects physical objects (stones, lottery ticket) to emotional states, creating a resonant exploration of adaptation that lingers after reading.</comment>
