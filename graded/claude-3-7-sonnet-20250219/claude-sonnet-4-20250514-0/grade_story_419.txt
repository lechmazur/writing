<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as an empathic blacksmith works effectively - her empathic nature clearly motivates her preservation work and connects logically to her ability to perceive the emotional echoes. Her solitude and purpose are well-established, though her "no-nonsense" quality is less developed than her empathic abilities. The character has depth within the constraints, showing consistent motivation through her craftsmanship and connection to humanity's remnants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear and satisfying arc from Mira's solitary crafting to the awakening of the dollhouse figures, with the stained glass ornament serving as an effective catalyst. The action of mollifying the spirits drives the narrative forward naturally. The story achieves a remarkable sense of completeness within its constraints, with the synchronized heartbeats providing a coherent throughline from the beginning's isolation to the ending's connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum creates an exceptionally rich atmosphere that perfectly complements the themes of preservation and memory. The post-human timeframe adds poignancy without overwhelming the narrative. Sensory details—the calloused hands, the rhythmic hammer, prismatic light scattering—effectively immerse the reader in this miniature world. The setting and concept of preserved traditions intertwine seamlessly to create a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of memory, connection, and preservation. The central metaphor of the blacksmith forging connections between past and future is powerful and consistent. The ending feels both satisfying and expansive, suggesting continued purpose. The theme of humanity's persistence through tradition is elegantly conveyed through showing rather than telling, with the heartbeat synchronization providing a compelling central image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its concept and execution, avoiding common tropes in ghost stories. The language occasionally becomes somewhat ornate ("practiced spontaneity," "prismatic light"), but generally serves the atmospheric quality. The emotional resonance feels genuine rather than stated, emerging from specific actions and details. The narrative maintains a consistent ethereal tone throughout, though some metaphors ("cosmic dust," "aurora through snow") verge on familiar territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, using them to build a conceptually rich narrative rather than feeling constrained by them. The brevity serves the story's dreamlike quality, creating an impression of a moment expanded rather than a compressed longer tale. The lingering image of humanity's heartbeat continuing through preserved traditions provides emotional and intellectual resonance beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
