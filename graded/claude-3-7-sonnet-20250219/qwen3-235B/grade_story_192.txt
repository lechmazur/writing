<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Livia's characterization as an eager lookout yearning for authentic connection in a digital world is established well. Her motivation to find something "real" drives her actions consistently. However, her character could be deepened with more specific personal history to contextualize her yearning, and her emotional reactions to discoveries could be more nuanced beyond curiosity and acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from discovery to investigation to resolution, with the sewing box serving as an effective catalyst. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints. However, the supernatural elements emerge somewhat abruptly, and the connection between Livia and the cameo feels convenient rather than carefully built toward. The resolution compresses complex emotional territory too quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa undergoing renovation creates an evocative backdrop that perfectly embodies the tension between past and present. Sensory details like "boots crunching on shards of marble," "shadows pooling like ink," and the "scent of lavender and mildew" create a rich, immersive atmosphere that reinforces the theme of connection across time. The juxtaposition of ancient frescoes with QR codes is particularly effective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores loneliness in the digital age and connection across time. The sewing box and cameo function as powerful symbols, and the narrative shows rather than tells Livia's emotional journey. The final image of her asleep against the box with her phone dark creates resonant closure. However, the story occasionally relies on telling ("she realized") where showing would be more impactful, and the poltergeist's motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the central concept is original, the execution occasionally falls into predictable patterns. The revelation of the protagonist's face on the cameo feels like a convenient plot device rather than an earned revelation. Some phrasing—particularly in the descriptions of technology contrasted with ancient elements—relies on somewhat familiar juxtapositions. The story avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on abstract concepts ("ruthless kindness") without fully embodying them through concrete details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about connection across time. The contrast between digital isolation and tactile history creates meaningful thematic tension. While the supernatural elements and familial connection could be more thoroughly developed given the constraints, the story leaves readers with the lingering question of what constitutes authentic human connection in an increasingly mediated world.</comment>
