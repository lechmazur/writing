<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira's character as a professional scapegoat is intriguing and well-established. Her methods and motivations are consistent with her profession, showing how she absorbs others' secrets and problems. The "obsessive calm" is effectively portrayed in her methodical approach. However, her emotional depth and personal stakes remain somewhat underdeveloped; we understand her function more than her inner conflicts or what drives her beyond her profession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from mysterious engagement to resolution, with the central action of "refashioning" driving the narrative forward. The connections between the washer, glyphs, and architect create a coherent mystery that resolves satisfyingly. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the established supernatural framework. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the architect's disappearance feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cloud city setting is vividly realized and integral to the narrative—not merely backdrop but a character itself with its "floating districts" and architecture that "rose and fell like breath." The atmosphere of transience and impermanence perfectly complements the abandoned identity theme. Sensory details like the "suspended glass orbs" and metal "glowing cherry-red" create immersive texture. The setting's ethereal nature reinforces the story's themes about identity and permanence exceptionally well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft with effective metaphors ("spoke in fractals") and thematic resonance. The central conflict between permanence and transience creates meaningful subtext. The story skillfully employs showing rather than telling, particularly in how the glyphs manifest physically. The ending achieves philosophical depth with its meditation on forgetting and sacrament. The prose occasionally becomes slightly overwrought, but generally maintains a compelling literary voice that serves the story's atmospheric needs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in its concept of a professional scapegoat and the manifestation of architectural sins as physical glyphs. Language is generally fresh with inventive metaphors. However, some phrases ("obsessive calm," "endless requiem") lean toward literary clichés, and certain transitions between paragraphs feel somewhat abrupt. The ending philosophical meditation, while beautiful, risks becoming slightly purple in its execution. The emotional resonance is genuine but could benefit from more specificity in Lira's personal stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels deliberately crafted rather than constrained. The cloud city setting and abandoned identity concept merge particularly well to create thematic depth. The brevity feels appropriate for this atmospheric piece. The lingering questions about the nature of the glyphs and Lira's continued role in this world suggest depth beyond the explicit narrative. Some minor prose issues and occasional overwriting prevent a higher score, but this is strong work with distinctive vision.</comment>
