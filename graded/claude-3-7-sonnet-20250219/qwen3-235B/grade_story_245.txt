<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The smuggler's characterization through grief and ritual creates a compelling psychological portrait. Their motivation to find waterfalls works as both literal quest and metaphor for processing loss. The character's relationship with the chopstick as physical reminder of their partner demonstrates exceptional depth. Only slight weakness is the somewhat limited direct action—the character primarily reflects rather than acts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative achieves remarkable coherence despite its fragmented, memory-driven structure. The plot follows the smuggler's ritual of reading tea leaves to continue their quest, with clear causality between grief and action. The circular structure connecting the opening pacing to the final departure creates satisfying closure. Minor deduction for minimal forward plot movement within the current timeline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric control through precise sensory details—cracked durasteel, crunching glass, dented thermos. The abandoned spaceport perfectly mirrors the character's emotional desolation. The contrast between mechanical decay and organic tea leaves creates meaningful tension. The setting functions simultaneously as physical space and psychological landscape without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates sophisticated craft through its layered symbolism (water/drought as emotional metaphors) and consistent thematic exploration of grief. The tension between cosmic indifference and human attachment creates intellectual depth. Particularly effective is how the story shows rather than tells emotional states through physical objects and actions. The ending achieves poignant resonance without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The writing maintains authenticity through specific, lived-in details and avoids generic sensory language. The metaphors are fresh ("all elbows and edges") and the emotional landscape complex rather than stated. Minor deductions for occasional density of figurative language that borders on purple prose, particularly in the final paragraphs. Otherwise, demonstrates distinctive style and original treatment of grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion despite incorporating multiple required elements. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each sentence carrying multiple layers of meaning. The narrative's strength lies in how it transforms a science fiction setting into an exploration of universal human experience. The lingering ambiguity about whether the waterfalls exist physically or symbolically provides compelling depth.</comment>
