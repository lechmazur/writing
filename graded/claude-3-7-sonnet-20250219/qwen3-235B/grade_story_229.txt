<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inventor's "mild curiosity" evolves convincingly into deeper devotion to an absurd promise. Her methodical approach to the supernatural investigation reflects her inventive nature. Her emotional journey—from skepticism ("she'd scoffed then") to understanding and finally laughter at the cosmic absurdity—creates a satisfying character arc. However, we lack deeper insight into how this quest has shaped her life beyond this moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc despite its dreamlike quality—from investigation to revelation to acceptance. The resonance of the device drives the narrative forward in a way that feels both magical and methodical. The resolution beautifully subverts expectations ("not about keeping promises, but letting them unravel into something truer than facts") while maintaining internal logic. The story achieves remarkable coherence despite its surreal elements and compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ship graveyard is rendered with exquisite sensory detail—salt-crusted planks, rain patterns, groaning timbers. The setting perfectly mirrors the theme of reconstructing the past, becoming both literal and metaphorical as the ship "shudders awake." The atmosphere blends melancholy, wonder, and cosmic absurdity with remarkable precision, creating a liminal space where past and present, life and death intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through layered imagery and metaphor. The rain as cipher, the weeping pearls, the rose imprinting memories—these create a richly symbolic landscape. The central theme—that the past exists as "resonance, not a tomb"—emerges organically. The prose balances lyricism with momentum, and the ending resonates with philosophical weight without becoming didactic. The story skillfully shows rather than tells its emotional and conceptual complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates striking originality in its approach to time, memory, and promise-keeping. While occasionally verging on purple prose, the language generally serves the dreamlike quality. The narrative avoids predictable supernatural tropes by focusing on emotional truth rather than literal resurrection. Some phrases ("absurdity crystallized") feel slightly manufactured, but the overall voice maintains consistency and the emotional journey feels authentically human rather than algorithmically constructed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story succeeds admirably in weaving required elements into a cohesive, evocative whole. The philosophically absurd tone perfectly complements the impossible task, while the sailing ship graveyard provides both literal and metaphorical resonance. The story transcends its constraints, using its brevity to create a haunting, impressionistic tale about the nature of promises, memory, and time. The lingering impression is of a fully realized world glimpsed through a keyhole.</comment>
