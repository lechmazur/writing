<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double is well-characterized through her contradictions—fearlessly performing dangerous stunts yet paralyzed by specific phobias. Her motivations evolve organically from fear avoidance to integration. The character's psychological journey feels authentic, though we could benefit from more specific details about her past to understand why she seeks this particular resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from acquisition of the map to completion of the net-unraveling challenge, with strong cause-effect relationships. The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite its complexity. However, the garage sale framing device feels slightly underdeveloped in relation to the central pyramid library sequence, creating minor pacing imbalance between beginning and end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with the subterranean library's sensory details—mildew-thick air, sputtering candles, and books that wait "patiently." The pyramid setting becomes a psychological space that mirrors the protagonist's inner landscape. The juxtaposition between mundane garage sales and mystical pyramid creates effective tension, though the timeframe transitions could be smoother.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storytelling employs sophisticated metaphorical connections between physical knots and psychological entanglements. The central theme of integrating rather than conquering fear offers genuine insight. Strong "show don't tell" technique reveals character growth through action. The ending achieves poignancy through the stunt double's changed relationship with her phobias, though the mirror revelation feels slightly too convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, several phrases ("its edges frayed like the nerves in her spine," "seawater and madness") feel deliberately literary in a way that calls attention to the craft rather than serving the narrative. Some metaphors become strained, particularly around the net's significance. However, the character's psychological journey maintains authentic human complexity rather than algorithmic logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole that explores the relationship between fear and identity. The metaphorical system connecting knots, phobias, and self-discovery is sophisticated. While occasionally overwritten, the story leaves readers with meaningful questions about how we carry our fears across lifetimes. Its ambitious thematic reach and psychological depth elevate it despite minor stylistic excesses.</comment>
