<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The social media exorcist is well-conceived with a distinctive professional role and philosophical conflict. Their motivation (purging digital ghosts) transitions organically to physical reality, creating tension between digital and tangible worlds. Their hesitation at the end ("wondering if they'd become what they hunted") shows meaningful introspection. However, we lack deeper personal history that would elevate the character beyond their function, and their final decision to follow the notification feels somewhat predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves with remarkable coherence from discovery to infiltration to mission completion within tight constraints. The receipt functions elegantly as both catalyst and key, and the reignition action manifests literally (projecting onto the moon) and metaphorically (reviving forgotten digital resistance). Particularly strong is how the beginning and end form a satisfying loop with the notification from a purged account. The only weakness is the somewhat underdeveloped explanation of what exactly the group is fighting against.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere blending digital and physical decay. The abandoned mess hall, derelict music hall, and basement club create a layered setting that perfectly embodies digital resistance in physical space. Sensory details are precise and evocative: "blue veins of light," the bouncer with "a face like a half-erased tattoo," Null's voice "like a dial-up modem," and the "smog-orange sunrise." The cyberpunk-adjacent aesthetic is consistent throughout, with digital concepts manifesting physically (receipt dissolving to ash) in ways that feel coherent rather than forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable thematic depth about digital memory, erasure, and resistance. Metaphors like "the raw edge back into the world" and imagery of "curiosity's hunger" elevate the text. The central tension between remembering and forgetting is powerfully embodied in both plot and character. The moon projection creates a striking visual payoff. Particularly effective is the subtext about digital activism and whether erasure is liberation or another form of control. The ending achieves a perfect circular structure without feeling predictable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates significant originality in its concept and execution. Phrases like "a curator of absence, a sculptor of voids" and "indifferent enthusiasm" show genuine creativity. The story avoids common cyberpunk clich√©s while working within recognizable genre parameters. However, some metaphors ("walls bled sound") verge on purple prose, and certain transitions feel slightly mechanical. The character of Null borders on archetype rather than fully realized individual. Overall, the story has a distinctive voice but occasionally slips into stylistic mannerisms that feel slightly performative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The social media exorcist, receipt, and digital resistance movement connect logically and thematically. Particularly impressive is how the "quietly loud" attribute manifests throughout in both setting and character actions. The brevity feels deliberate, mirroring the compression of digital information. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about digital identity and resistance that transcend the immediate narrative, suggesting deeper layers worthy of multiple readings.</comment>
