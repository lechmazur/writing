<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's secretive nature, her dedication to preserving forgotten wisdom, and her "angrily peaceful defiance" create a consistent and well-developed character. Her transition from aloofness to emotional connection through the boy's recognition shows meaningful development. The character's dual life—athlete by day, digital preservationist by night—is motivated by clear purpose and reveals depth through her precise movements that echo her former herbal practices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the marathon training providing a strong structural backbone. The parallel journeys of physical endurance and cultural preservation intertwine effectively. The encounter with the boy creates a perfect turning point, and the resolution at the marathon finish line brings satisfying closure while suggesting continuation. The hug serves as an effective emotional pivot, though the introduction of the cave location feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned amusement park creates a hauntingly perfect backdrop—a forgotten place for forgotten knowledge. Sensory details are exceptional: crunching gravel, rusted roller coasters, the teapot's "fractures glowing faintly in the gloom," and "phantom screams" create an immersive atmosphere. The juxtaposition of decay and preservation heightens thematic resonance, with the ghost train's control booth transformed into a sanctum that poetically mirrors her mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its central metaphor—forgotten wisdom preserved in hidden spaces. Literary craft shows in sophisticated parallelism between physical training and cultural preservation. The prose balances lyrical qualities with narrative drive, particularly in phrases like "her rage sublimated into algorithms and mile markers." The nameless connection between two people from different generations sharing cultural knowledge creates profound thematic resonance about legacy and resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids AI-typical patterns through consistent emotional tone and purposeful progression. Its metaphors feel fresh and specific to the world created. The concept of encoding folk remedies into playlists represents genuine creative thinking. Some sentences in the middle section grow overly complex, verging on purple prose, and the narrative occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The logistics of the playlist encryption could be more technically grounded.</comment>
