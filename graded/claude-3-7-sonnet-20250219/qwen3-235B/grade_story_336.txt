<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arman is effectively characterized as a weary undertaker whose exhaustion comes from burying "too many unmarked graves." His motivation to protect hope and confront the wraith is clear and consistent. The personal sacrifice of his daughter's last breath reveals depth and emotional stakes. His actions align perfectly with his established motivation of preserving hope. However, with limited dialogue, we don't fully hear his "voice," and some aspects of his backstory remain tantalizingly unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The imprisonment action drives the plot effectively, with clear cause-and-effect relationships between the car backfire, the wraith's stirring, and Arman's response. The story achieves a complete arc despite constraints, moving from the wraith's awakening to its imprisonment and Arman's contemplative departure. The pacing effectively builds tension through the ritual and resolution. However, some plot elements (like the exact nature of the entity and why it responds to violence) could be more fully developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Persian palace setting is rendered with remarkable atmospheric detail—"a labyrinth of dust and forgotten echoes"—that perfectly complements the ancient astronomical clock and the supernatural threat. The sensory details are exceptional, from the "gears gnashing time into a spiral" to the dawn that "bled gold across its stones." The atmosphere of ancient power and dormant threat perfectly supports both the character's mission and the story's concept of preserving knowledge and light against darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its theme of preserving light in darkness. Metaphors are consistently powerful and original—"hope—a fragile, flickering thing—pressing against his ribs." The central conflict between preservation and destruction is clearly established. The ending feels purposeful and resonant, leaving the reader with the powerful idea that "even in the absolute dark, a man could carve light with broken hands." The story effectively shows rather than tells, though a few moments rely on direct statement of emotions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its fusion of Persian mythology, astronomical imagery, and the emotional core of sacrifice. The prose avoids clichés and generic descriptions, instead offering specific, evocative imagery like "a weary undertaker, a keeper of impossible light." The story maintains a consistent tone throughout, with no jarring shifts. A few phrases edge toward purple prose ("its voice a sandstorm"), but these generally serve the mythic quality rather than detract from it. The emotional core feels authentic rather than algorithmically constructed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The astronomical clock, Persian palace, and concept of imprisoning darkness through reversed time create a unified mythological framework. The brevity serves the story well, creating a concentrated, impactful narrative. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of sacrifice and preservation that extend beyond its explicit narrative, suggesting significant depth. A few minor transitions could be smoother, but the overall execution is impressive.</comment>
