<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>June's character as an underestimated rebel is effectively established through her willingness to enter the abandoned park and confront supernatural forces. Her connection to her family through the knife with herb-etched blades reveals depth and cultural specificity. However, her emotional journey could be more clearly developed—we understand her motivation is finding her brother, but her internal transformation feels somewhat rushed within the tight constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves with purpose from the phone call to the haunted house confrontation to the liberation of trapped souls, creating a complete arc. The Korean culinary elements cleverly thread throughout, strengthening coherence. However, the resolution feels somewhat hastily executed, with the brother dissolving into "star anise-scented mist" without sufficient preparation for this supernatural outcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly realized through sensory details—"peeling neon," "rotting wood," "burnt kimchi," and "wasabi-scented memories" create a unique fusion of horror and nostalgic elements. The house's transformation into a maze of "sizzling cast-iron pans and sobbing clowns" brilliantly merges the culinary theme with the haunted setting, creating an atmosphere that is both disorienting and emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates impressive craft through its integration of Korean culinary traditions with supernatural elements, creating original metaphors like "tendrils of congealed gochujang." The theme of food as memory and connection is poignantly developed. The ending effectively balances resolution with lingering questions. However, some metaphors ("adaptation's bitter aftertaste") feel slightly heavy-handed rather than emerging organically from the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its fusion of horror and culinary elements, with Korean cultural specificity adding authenticity. Sensory details like "sesame oil" and "star anise-scented mist" avoid generic description. However, some phrases ("aching, joyful knowledge that even rot could birth mushrooms") veer toward overwrought territory, and certain transitions between haunted house horror and family drama feel abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive voice. The Korean culinary theme provides an original framework for exploring familial bonds and supernatural phenomena. While occasionally the prose becomes overly ornate, the overall effect is a memorably unique ghost story that successfully balances horror elements with emotional depth. The cultural specificity elevates what might otherwise be a conventional haunted house tale.</comment>
