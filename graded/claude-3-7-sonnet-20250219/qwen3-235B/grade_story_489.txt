<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unseen observer has a clear motivation and purpose but lacks personal complexity. The "aggressively kind" attribute manifests effectively in its determined actions to preserve tradition, creating tension between its ghostly nature and forceful purpose. However, without dialogue or deeper internal conflict, the character remains somewhat archetypal rather than fully dimensional. Its relationship to the whistle and its mission is well-established, but we learn little about its own history or evolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with excellent cause-and-effect relationships. The action of "flinging" the whale's call effectively drives the narrative forward, connecting the observer's intentions with tangible consequences. The story achieves remarkable cohesion within its constraints, moving from the observer's mission to its impact on the dancer and back to the observer with satisfying circularity. The undercurrent concept shapes the plot organically, though the resolution feels somewhat open-ended by design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details that evoke decay and timelessness. The juxtaposition of the ancient lighthouse with the distant modern stage creates meaningful spatial tension. Atmospheric elements—salt air, creaking wood, fog—establish a liminal space where past and present merge. The world-building efficiently connects the physical setting with the metaphysical undercurrents, making the lighthouse both literal structure and metaphorical beacon for lost traditions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional and intellectual impact through its layered metaphors and rich symbolism. The lighthouse beam as knowledge preservation, the whale call as ancestral memory, and the whistle as conduit between worlds all deepen the narrative beyond plot mechanics. The writing shows sophisticated control of imagery and rhythm, particularly in moments of tension. While the theme of cultural preservation is somewhat familiar, its execution through spectral intervention offers fresh perspective. The story effectively shows rather than tells emotional states and motivations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, particularly in the unexpected connection between lighthouse and dance performance. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with specific, varied sensory details and consistent tone throughout. However, occasional phrases ("brazen calm," "unseen and unthanked") feel slightly formulaic. The narrative takes creative risks in its non-linear connections and spectral perspective, though some metaphors (particularly around wisdom and tradition) could be more distinctive. The emotional resonance feels authentic rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The narrative demonstrates sophisticated control of language and imagery, creating a haunting atmosphere that lingers after reading. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying significant narrative weight. The story's exploration of cultural memory and preservation achieves depth without becoming pedantic. While not flawless, it demonstrates considerable craft and thoughtfulness in its execution.</comment>
