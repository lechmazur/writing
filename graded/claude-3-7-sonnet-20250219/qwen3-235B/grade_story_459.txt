<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli is effectively characterized through their physical awkwardness ("elegantly clumsy") that manifests in meaningful ways. Their methodical approach to ghost hunting through tour research shows dedication to their unusual ability. The character's growth from clumsiness to grace through understanding the true nature of hauntings demonstrates meaningful development. However, their initial motivation could be more clearly established—why they originally care about helping ghosts isn't fully articulated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot follows a satisfying arc from problem (haunted elevator) through investigation to resolution (releasing the ghost). The connection between the flower crown, sand castle lab, and the drowning bride creates a cohesive narrative logic. The "dissection" of hauntings drives the plot forward naturally. The pacing successfully balances exposition and action within the word constraint, though the resolution feels slightly rushed compared to the careful setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through contrasting elements: the mechanical elevator against the ethereal ghost, sterile lab lights versus oceanic decay, preservation versus letting go. Sensory details like crunching sand and the crown's brittle petals create immersive texture. The sand castle lab serves as both literal setting and metaphor for futile attempts to preserve what's lost, perfectly complementing the story's themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its exploration of grief, memory, and release. The symbolism of sand castles—beautiful but ultimately ephemeral—provides powerful subtext. The final lines deliver philosophical depth without being heavy-handed. Particularly effective is how the narrative shows Eli's evolution through action rather than explanation. The only weakness is in the slightly hurried transition to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates genuine originality in its unique setting and premise. Language choices like "dissonance of silence" and "time forgiving itself" feel fresh rather than formulaic. The narrative avoids predictable ghost story tropes by focusing on emotional release rather than standard haunting resolution. The writing maintains consistent tone throughout. A few metaphors could be more specific to this particular world rather than somewhat generalized ("like a marionette with one frayed string").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative where each component serves the central theme. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with every sentence carrying narrative weight. The lingering philosophical observation about memory and forgetting provides intellectual substance beyond the ghost story framework. Minor improvements could be made in pacing the resolution and deepening initial character motivation.</comment>
