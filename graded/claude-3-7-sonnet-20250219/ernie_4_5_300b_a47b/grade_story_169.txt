<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zevyr is well-developed as a soul-broker with clear motivation. Their role as intermediary between the dead and lost songs creates compelling tension, especially as we see the cost of their work ("felt their own memories fraying"). The "weirdly static" attribute manifests effectively in their ritual-like approach. However, we could benefit from more insight into Zevyr's personal stakes beyond professional obligation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with strong causality: Zevyr's method of reading reversed labels produces the forgotten song, satisfying the client but exacting a personal cost. The recycling timeframe creates elegant circularity, with the ending suggesting continuation of the cycle. The narrative achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the introduction of the "balance" concept could be more fully integrated earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building creates a dreamlike yet tangible setting. The floating platform "above a sea of liquid starlight" with "moss-cloaked stone and trembling lanterns" establishes a liminal space perfect for communion between living and dead. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful: the "thick and metallic" wine, "notes bloomed in the air," and the harpist's voice as "a crackle of autumn leaves."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves profound impact through its exploration of memory, art, and sacrifice. Literary devices enrich the narrative: "time pooled like spilled honey" and the paradox of "grandiose modesty" reflect the story's themes. The central conflict between preservation and loss creates meaningful tension. The ending resonates with poignant circularity. Some metaphors occasionally verge on overindulgence, slightly diluting their power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its concept and execution. The prose is largely fresh and evocative, particularly in its sensory descriptions. However, certain phrasings ("vines of sound twisting") occasionally veer toward purple prose, and some metaphors feel slightly overwrought. The emotional landscape is well-rendered but could benefit from more subtlety in places. The story's dreamlike quality sometimes masks opportunities for more specific, grounded details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This is a remarkably cohesive and ambitious story that successfully integrates all required elements into a unified whole. The fantastical premise is handled with confidence, creating a world that feels both surreal and emotionally authentic. The story lingers in the mind, raising questions about memory, art, and sacrifice. Minor issues with occasional overwriting and some underdeveloped concepts prevent a higher score, but this remains impressive work.</comment>
