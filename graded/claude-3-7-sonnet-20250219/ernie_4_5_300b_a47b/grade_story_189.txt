<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's character has a clear trait of "uniquely literal" mind that drives her approach to puzzle-solving, but this trait isn't fully explored beyond a single mention. Her "brazen calm" is repeatedly noted but sometimes feels like telling rather than showing. Her motivation to decode star maps is established, though the personal stakes could be deeper. The character shows determination and resourcefulness, but lacks the complexity and nuanced development that would elevate her beyond a capable protagonist archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains a clear arc within the constraints, effectively using the "overcharging" action as a climactic moment. The cause-and-effect relationships follow logically, with the notes providing direction and the key enabling access to the power system. The ghostly confrontation adds tension, though it resolves somewhat abruptly. The story achieves completeness with Lira accomplishing her immediate goal while hinting at a larger mission, though the pacing accelerates noticeably in the latter half.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement setting is richly realized with sensory details like "damp, cobwebbed corner" and air that "tasted of salt and iron." The post-war water scarcity effectively contextualizes the importance of finding hidden aquifers. The ghostly presence is well-integrated with the setting, creating atmospheric tension. The relationship between the phone booth key and the forgotten junction box is cleverly established, making the setting and objects feel cohesively interconnected rather than arbitrarily combined.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension through Lira's puzzle-solving and the awakening of the lighthouse ghost. The central theme of restoration in a broken world emerges naturally. Literary techniques include the metaphorical connection between the lighthouse's hum and Lira's heartbeat. The ending provides satisfaction while opening toward future possibilities. However, the ghost confrontation feels somewhat underdeveloped, and certain symbolic elements (like the star maps) could be more deeply integrated with the emotional core of the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates creativity in combining the required elements into a cohesive narrative. However, there are instances of telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Lira's "brazen calm." Some phrasings like "her brazen calm was a shield, forged by years of deciphering riddles" feel somewhat formulaic. The ghost's dialogue ("You think you've won?") verges on clich√©. While the post-apocalyptic water scarcity setting has potential, it relies on familiar tropes without significant subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a coherent narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The haunted lighthouse, post-war setting, and mysterious notes create an intriguing atmosphere. The protagonist's quest has both immediate stakes (decoding the maps) and larger implications (finding water in a parched world). However, the story occasionally sacrifices depth for breadth in trying to incorporate all elements, and certain aspects (like the ghost's significance) feel underdeveloped. Despite these limitations, it creates a vivid snapshot of a larger world and leaves the reader curious about what happens next.</comment>
