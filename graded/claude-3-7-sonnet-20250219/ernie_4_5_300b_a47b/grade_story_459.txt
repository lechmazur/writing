<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's dual identity as an elevator technician who sees ghosts creates an intriguing contradiction that shapes his actions. His motivation to free spirits using the crown is clear, though his emotional journey could be more deeply explored. The "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests physically but needs more psychological development. His voice remains somewhat distant despite the intimate nature of his spiritual encounters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from problem (ghost with crown) to resolution (helping the ghost move on). The dissection metaphor effectively frames Elias's methodical approach to understanding ghosts. The connection between his technical work and supernatural gift creates thematic coherence. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and the method of staking out ghost tours isn't fully integrated into the climactic scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a compelling symbolic backdropâ€”fragile structures artificially preserved, mirroring the ghosts' suspended state. Sensory details of salt, cold air, and humming machines effectively establish atmosphere. The juxtaposition of the technical lab with supernatural elements creates productive tension. The setting brilliantly reinforces the theme of impermanence versus preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the crown as both literal object and metaphorical burden. The parallel between elevators and ghosts following patterns demonstrates skilled symbolism. The theme of release versus preservation resonates throughout. The ending achieves emotional resolution without being heavy-handed. However, the dialogue is minimal, and the conflict could be heightened for greater emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, phrases like "complex simplicity" and "elegantly clumsy" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient development. The ghost's silence seems convenient rather than meaningful. Some metaphors ("flickering like a faulty bulb") are predictable. The emotional journey progresses logically but lacks the messiness of genuine human experience. The sandcastle metaphor, while apt, becomes too explicit by the conclusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with symbolic resonance. The sandcastle preservation lab brilliantly complements the theme of impermanence versus holding on. However, the protagonist's emotional journey feels somewhat streamlined, and the resolution comes too easily. The writing shows creative thinking in its metaphorical connections but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states.</comment>
