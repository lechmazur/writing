<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira Vey emerges as a well-drawn character whose apothecary background meaningfully informs her actions. Her motivation to preserve the butterflies through unorthodox means reveals her principled nature, and the "unjustly fair" attribute is effectively integrated into her characterization through the captain's criticism. However, her emotional connection to the butterflies feels somewhat underdeveloped within the constraints, and we lack deeper insight into what personally drives her moral stance beyond a general environmental concern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within its constraints, with the infection concept driving the narrative forward in a logical manner. The use of Morse code as communication method is integrated well with both character and setting. However, the depth charge conflict emerges abruptly without sufficient buildup, and the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The story establishes a clear beginning and middle, but the ending, while poetic, lacks the specificity needed for a fully satisfying conclusion to the established tensions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is richly rendered with sensory details that create a vivid atmosphere—from the "groan of rusted gears" to portholes "streaked with salt and regret." The integration of the broken treaties timeframe with the environmental themes creates meaningful context. The juxtaposition of mechanical elements with natural ones (butterflies, bioluminescence) effectively enhances the thematic tension. The atmosphere successfully balances melancholy with hope in a way that supports the central concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the highlighter as communication tool, the submarine named Icarus) and creates emotional resonance around environmental loss and hope. The themes of preservation, unconventional connection, and defiance against societal norms are well-developed. However, the narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly in explaining Lira's motivations. The climactic moment with the butterflies appearing has impact, but would benefit from more specific sensory description to fully land its emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of steampunk elements with environmental themes and the creative use of bioluminescent tracking. However, some phrases ("tears mixing with salt spray," "her chest ached") fall into predictable emotional descriptors, and certain metaphors ("love wasn't a cage—it was an infection") feel somewhat forced. The writing occasionally lapses into purple prose ("portholes streaked with salt and regret") that prioritizes lyricism over precision. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive stylistic signature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates multiple assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with meaningful thematic resonance. The environmental message works effectively alongside the personal journey of the protagonist, creating layers of meaning. While the brevity constrains full development of certain elements (particularly the crew dynamics and the specific nature of the broken treaties), the story achieves a complete arc within its limitations. The lingering hope at the conclusion provides emotional satisfaction, though a more specific final image would strengthen its impact.</comment>
