<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's arrogance is well-portrayed through his stance, physical details ("blade that gleamed like spite"), and demanding manner. His character arc from proud swordsman to humble student shows meaningful development. His motivation to restore his family's legacy feels authentic, and his transformation is earned through the internal conflict between pride and necessity. The dialogue reveals his character effectively, though his final transformation could use slightly more psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from confrontation to resolution with the authorization request driving the narrative forward. The traditional song creates a surprising yet fitting method for the tapestry's restoration. Despite brevity, the story achieves a complete arc with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The concept of shackled potential shapes both the conflict and resolution elegantly. The pacing builds tension effectively through the confrontation and release through the song, creating a satisfying structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard is rendered with exceptional sensory detail—stone tiles damp from dawn's mist, cherry blossoms trembling. The setting perfectly complements both the formality of calligraphy and the swordsman's rigid pride. The atmosphere shifts subtly as the story progresses, from tense confrontation to harmonious resolution. The imagery of paused cherry blossoms during the song creates a moment of suspended time that beautifully manifests the "between breaths" timeframe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—the frayed tapestry representing Kael's family legacy, the sheathed sword signifying restrained power, and cherry blossoms embodying transformation. The central theme of harmony versus force emerges naturally. The dialogue is purposeful and revealing. The ending feels earned and resonant with its image of cherry blossoms "settling on the tapestry like a promise." The contrast between the visual (sword) and auditory (song) paths to power creates meaningful subtext about different forms of strength.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids formulaic writing with fresh imagery and specific sensory details. The metaphors feel original—"blade that gleamed like spite" and cherry blossoms that tremble "as if aware of his fury." However, some phrasing becomes slightly purple ("Harsh tenderness filled the courtyard") and the character transformation follows a somewhat predictable humbling-of-the-arrogant arc. The dialogue occasionally slips into overly formal territory, though this may suit the setting's formality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The contrast between visual/martial power and auditory/emotional power creates thematic depth. The brevity serves the story well, focusing on a single transformative moment. The ending leaves readers with the satisfying sense of a character at the beginning of a new journey, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. Some phrases could be tightened for greater impact, but overall the craft level is high.</comment>
