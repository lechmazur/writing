<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brewer's motivation to embody his values provides a psychological foundation, but his character lacks specificity beyond his profession and political stance. His reactions to the mirror shard show some depth, but the internal struggle feels somewhat abstract rather than deeply personal. His voice maintains consistency but doesn't achieve true distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc with the brewer's journey into and out of the mansion serving as a metaphorical confrontation with his values. The mirror shard effectively catalyzes his internal conflict, and the resolution brings satisfying closure. However, the "initiate" action feels underdeveloped, and the transition between his disillusionment and renewed purpose lacks sufficient causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard creates a richly atmospheric backdrop that effectively mirrors the character's internal landscape. Sensory details like "spilled ink" darkness, the cold draft, and scents of wet earth establish a tangible environment. The contrast between the isolation of the mansion and the communal protest effectively enhances thematic tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the mirror as metaphor for fragmented identity, with strong symbolic resonance throughout. The narrative achieves emotional impact through the character's realization about authenticity versus genericness. However, the central conflict could be more sharply defined, and some metaphors ("mansion's throat") feel overwrought rather than organic to the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While avoiding major AI-writing pitfalls, the story occasionally lapses into abstract philosophical musings that read as generic rather than character-specific. Phrases like "a place where values dissolved into static" and "they were all shards of the same mirror" feel somewhat formulaic. The emotional progression lacks the messy nuance of human experience, following a too-neat arc from disillusionment to renewed purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole, particularly melding the haunted setting with the character's existential crisis. The brevity works well for the single-scene structure. However, the philosophical themes occasionally overshadow character development, and some symbolic elements (like the yellowish discoloration) remain underdeveloped despite their prominence.</comment>
