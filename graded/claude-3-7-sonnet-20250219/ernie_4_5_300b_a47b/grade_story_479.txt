<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marlowe Voss is well-established through her unique profession and mission. Her character is distinctly shaped by the "glamorous undertaker" role, which manifests in details like her "sequined veil" and ceremonial approach to her work. Her motivation to preserve the extraordinary in the ordinary is clear and consistent. However, we don't see enough emotional complexity or development within the narrative to reach the highest rating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "elongate" action as both literal (stretching coffins) and metaphorical (extending memory/legacy). There's a satisfying arc from the initial measuring to the completion of Eleanor's coffin and Marlowe's departure. The narrative maintains coherence through its focus on the preservation ritual. The pacing is generally strong, though the connection between the social network archive and the coffin-making process could be more organically integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of the mortuary setting with the digital "social network archive" creates a compelling juxtaposition of the physical and virtual realms of death. The atmosphere of reverent preservation amid digital impermanence is evocative and thematically resonant. The sensory details—the "flickering glow," the brass tape's patina, the viscosity of cobalt blue paint—create a richly textured world where the ceremonial aspects of undertaking blend with digital archiving in a distinctive way.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the coffin elongation as a metaphor for preserving the fullness of human experience beyond death. The contrast between Eleanor's curated online presence and her true loneliness creates emotional resonance. The imagery of the paint as "a portal" and the measuring tape's coordinates corresponding to emotional dimensions demonstrates skillful metaphorical thinking. The ending successfully balances closure with a sense of ongoing mission, though some metaphors occasionally border on being overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally relies on purple prose ("jubilant remorse," "visual hymn") that feels artificially literary. Some metaphors, while creative, seem deliberately ornate rather than organic to the narrative. The writing sometimes prioritizes flowery language over emotional authenticity, particularly in passages like "a lacquer of obsidian and hope" and "a serpent of memory." The core concept is genuinely fresh, but the style occasionally undermines its originality with overwrought phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinctive premise. The blend of digital archiving and traditional undertaking creates a unique framework that supports the theme of preserving the extraordinary in seemingly ordinary lives. While occasionally burdened by overwritten passages, the narrative achieves emotional resonance through its central metaphor of elongating coffins to accommodate the fullness of lives. The brevity works well for this conceptual piece, though some relationships between elements could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
