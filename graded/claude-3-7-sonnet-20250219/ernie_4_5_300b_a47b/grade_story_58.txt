<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Jessa's loyalty trait is referenced but not fully demonstrated through actions. Her meditation motivation creates good tension with Rae's approach, but her transformation feels somewhat rushed. Rae's character provides an effective contrast, though her "radicalize a funeral" laughter seems more told than shown. The journal effectively reveals Jessa's methodical nature, but her emotional journey could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The power outage effectively drives the narrative, creating the conditions for both conflict and resolution. The progression from isolation to connection works well within the word constraint. The "balance" concept elegantly frames both problem and solution. However, the narrative shifts somewhat abruptly from Jessa's solitary meditation to her interaction with Rae, and the resolution feels slightly accelerated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower creates a brilliant metaphor-rich setting that perfectly complements the themes. The power outage effectively transforms the space from sanctuary to unsettling void. Sensory details are strong—rattling glass, yellow glow, fluttering wings—creating a vivid atmosphere that physically embodies Jessa's internal journey. The contrast between darkness and light is particularly well-utilized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moths as multifaceted symbols for fragility, transformation, and attraction to destructive forces. The central conflict between stillness and movement as approaches to balance is compelling. The resolution offers genuine insight without being heavy-handed. Dialogue serves character development well. However, some metaphors ("radicalize a funeral") feel slightly overwritten, and the emotional transformation could be more earned through specific moments rather than stated realizations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of meditation amid chaos offers originality, but some phrases ("sanctified dread," "sickly yellow glow") feel somewhat generic. The moth symbolism, while effective, occasionally veers into predictable territory. Character development follows a somewhat conventional arc of resistance-to-acceptance. The ending insight about navigating storms in darkness provides a fresh perspective, but the journey there contains moments of telling rather than showing, particularly in Jessa's emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The moth observation tower and power outage create an effective framework for exploring inner turmoil and connection. The contrast between characters' approaches to balance provides meaningful thematic depth. However, some transitions feel rushed within the word constraint, and certain elements (like the "radicalize" action) feel less organically incorporated than others. The ending successfully leaves readers with a thought-provoking perspective on navigating chaos.</comment>
