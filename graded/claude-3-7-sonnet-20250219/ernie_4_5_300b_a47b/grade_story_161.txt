<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marla's characterization is compelling and consistent. Her vigilance as an orchardist translates naturally to her meticulous analysis at the facility. Her never-tardy attribute is woven throughout, showing how her precision and attention to detail drive her conspiracy investigation. The sardonic glee effectively masks her grief, creating psychological depth. Her motivation—finding patterns that might connect to her daughter's disappearance—is clear and poignant. The character's transformation from orchardist to detective feels earned rather than forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from small observations to major revelation. The demonstration action drives the narrative forward organically, creating escalating tension as Marla proves her theory. The connection between peacock patterns and conspiracy is well-established through multiple examples rather than mere assertion. The resolution satisfies both the external plot (FBI raid) and internal journey (finding peace). The cause-effect relationships are logical within the story's framework, though the final leap to surveillance drones feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility provides an inspired setting for pattern recognition, and the timeframe of volunteering allows for gradual discovery. Sensory details like the "flickering neon sign buzzing like a trapped wasp" and the "rain-lashed Thursday" create atmospheric tension. The connection between the orchard (past) and facility (present) is meaningfully established. The story skillfully uses concrete details—cafeteria menus, maintenance logs, employee schedules—to ground the conspiracy, making the fantastic elements more believable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth in limited space. The peacock motif functions brilliantly as both literal pattern and metaphor for hidden truths and beauty in grief. The emotional journey from obsession to vindication to peace creates a satisfying arc. The subtext about pattern-seeking as a response to trauma adds psychological complexity. The final image of the peacock-feather amulet at the daughter's grave delivers emotional resonance without sentimentality. The story effectively shows rather than tells Marla's emotional state through her actions and observations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unusual premise and setting. The peacock-as-code concept feels fresh rather than derivative. The narrative maintains consistent tone and psychological realism. However, some transitions between major plot points feel slightly compressed, particularly the leap from personal investigation to FBI raid. While generally avoiding purple prose, occasional phrases like "the peacock's tail became her compass" verge on overwrought. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than formulaic, with nuanced handling of Marla's complex motivations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each paragraph advancing both plot and character. The story demonstrates creative thinking in connecting orcharding, pattern recognition, grief, and conspiracy through the peacock motif. It leaves readers with lingering questions about pattern-seeking as both salvation and potential delusion. The final line elegantly captures the story's essence without overexplaining.</comment>
