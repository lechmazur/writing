<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eldric's character development is well-executed through his transformation from rigid scribe to someone embracing empathy. His uptight nature is established early and consistently challenged throughout. The uncertainty in his resolve creates compelling tension, though his emotional journey could be more subtly revealed rather than explicitly stated in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Eldric's rigid beginning to emotional breakthrough. The envelope adhesive analysis drives the narrative forward logically, connecting to both the witch's past and Tesla's bulb. While the story achieves a sense of completeness, some transitions between plot points feel slightly rushed, particularly in connecting the adhesive to the emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's greenhouse on gravestones creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that perfectly complements the transformation theme. Sensory details—moss-streaked glass, decaying herbs, creaking spells—immerse readers in this liminal space. The setting brilliantly mirrors Eldric's internal state, with the gravestones and Tesla's bulb creating tension between death and illumination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (light bulb as awakening) and creates emotional resonance through Eldric's struggle. The theme of transformation is well-developed through the parallel between scientific discovery and emotional awakening. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, and some metaphors (like "cradle empathy in arms of steel") feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in connecting Tesla's invention with witchcraft and emotional transformation. However, some phrasing feels unnecessarily ornate ("certainly uncertain resolve," "bellow of frustration"), and emotional descriptions occasionally rely on direct statements rather than nuanced showing. The prose sometimes becomes purple, particularly in passages describing Eldric's emotional state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive narrative about transformation. The greenhouse setting, Tesla's bulb, and the witch's magic create an effective backdrop for Eldric's character journey. While occasionally overwritten, the story leaves readers with the lingering image of the scribe holding the dimly glowing bulb—a powerful symbol of his nascent emotional awakening.</comment>
