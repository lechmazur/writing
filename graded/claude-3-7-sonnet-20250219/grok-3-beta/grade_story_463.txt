<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marwood's dry wit comes through clearly in his dialogue and internal thoughts, creating a distinctive voice. His motivation to restore honor to forgotten vows is established, though the personal connection could be deeper. His skepticism paired with determination creates an interesting tension, but his character lacks some dimensionality beyond his mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from crossing off the final name to discovering the hidden logbook. The confiscation action drives the narrative forward naturally. The connection between the rope, the dance, and the discovery creates coherent cause-and-effect relationships. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed, with the map to the ritual introduced too abruptly in the final sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric, with excellent sensory details like "salt-stained walls," "creaking floorboards," and "dusty windowpanes." The supernatural elements blend seamlessly with the physical environment. The eerie mood perfectly complements the concept of eroding promises and lost sailors, creating a cohesive world where the past literally haunts the present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the rope as both physical object and metaphorical tether to lost souls) and creates emotional resonance around broken promises. The theme of honoring forgotten oaths is well-developed. However, the ending introduces new elements rather than fully resolving existing tensions, and some metaphors ("a crypt of unkept words") feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI hallmarks, certain phrases feel formulaic ("with reckless precision," "pressed on with a smirk"). The metaphors occasionally veer toward purple prose. The narrative maintains consistent tone but relies on some ghost story tropes without fully subverting them. The character's emotional landscape lacks nuance, with his determination presented somewhat flatly rather than with psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with atmospheric strength. The supernatural maritime setting provides a strong foundation, and the concept of tracking down broken oaths creates meaningful stakes. However, some elements feel slightly forced (particularly the dance as method), and the ending introduces new plot points rather than providing satisfying closure to what's been established.</comment>
