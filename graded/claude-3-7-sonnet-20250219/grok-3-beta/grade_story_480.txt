<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's character as a "social media exorcist" is intriguing and her motivation to "feed curiosity with life's raw edge" comes through in her actions. Her quietly loud attribute manifests in her subtle yet impactful presence. However, her emotional journey lacks sufficient depthâ€”we see her professional persona but get limited insight into her personal transformation beyond a vague sense of accomplishment at the end. Her "indifferent enthusiasm" is mentioned but could be more consistently demonstrated through specific reactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Mara tracking digital ghosts to infiltrating the secret club and connecting with the receipt's owner. The reigniting action drives the narrative forward purposefully. The story achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints, with the beginning in the music hall connecting thematically to the ending. However, the transition between settings feels somewhat abrupt, and the resolution, while poetic, is somewhat understated given the buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric elements are the story's strongest feature. The abandoned music hall, mess hall, and alley club create a cohesive mood of decay and hidden life that perfectly mirrors the digital/physical divide theme. Sensory details like "dust danced in slivers of moonlight" and "the air buzzed with whispered confessions" effectively immerse the reader. The physical spaces brilliantly symbolize the "hollows of online life," creating a rich metaphorical landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of digital disconnection versus authentic human connection. The metaphor of exorcising "digital ghosts" is compelling, and the contrast between online personas and real-life encounters creates meaningful tension. The ending offers a satisfying ambiguity that invites reflection. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some metaphors ("her heart a quiet drum") feel somewhat generic rather than specific to this unique narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a "social media exorcist" is original, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("her phone glowing like a lantern," "her heart a quiet drum"). The story occasionally slips into telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific reactions. The narrative voice maintains consistency but sometimes relies on abstract descriptions rather than concrete, specific details that would ground the fantastical elements. The grocery receipt with "bread, milk, despair" is a fresh touch, but some metaphors feel familiar rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about digital versus authentic connection. The concept of a social media exorcist tracking digital ghosts through physical spaces creates an intriguing framework. The brevity works well for this slice-of-life moment, though it limits deeper character development. The story leaves readers with thought-provoking questions about modern connection, but could benefit from more specific, unique details to elevate it from good to exceptional.</comment>
