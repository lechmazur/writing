<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Torvald's hesitancy and awkwardness are consistently portrayed through physical description and internal conflict. His motivation to restore traditional systems is clear, though his emotional journey from self-doubt to reluctant acceptance feels somewhat predictable. The hermit crab metaphor effectively mirrors his character development, but his transformation by the end feels slightly rushed given the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Torvald's uncertainty to his acceptance of responsibility. The hermit crab method is ingeniously integrated as both literal action and metaphor. The story achieves a sense of completeness with the postcard serving as both catalyst and resolution. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the actual "filing away" of evidence shifts from physical to metaphorical without sufficient clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents creates a striking juxtaposition that brilliantly mirrors Torvald's internal conflict. The sensory details of steam, frost, and crunching boots effectively immerse the reader. The setting's contradictory elements (ice and heat, death and life) serve the bridging worlds concept exceptionally well, creating a liminal space that feels both physically and spiritually significant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The hermit crab metaphor provides a sophisticated layer of meaning that elevates the narrative. The story effectively shows rather than tells Torvald's transformation. The theme of bridging worlds through ritual and tradition emerges organically. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by occasionally overwrought language, and the conflict resolution feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers, certain phrases feel overly formal ("rancor toward his inadequacy flickered"). The hermit crab metaphor is fresh, but some descriptions rely on telling rather than showing emotional states. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally slips into purple prose. The world-building shows originality, though the character's emotional journey follows a somewhat predictable arc of doubt to acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole with the frigid tundra orchard and hermit crab metaphor being particularly well-utilized. The juxtaposition of ice and steam creates a memorable setting that enhances the bridging worlds concept. However, some passages feel overwritten, and the character's transformation could benefit from more specific emotional detail rather than abstract description.</comment>
