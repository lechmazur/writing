<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sigrid's character is well-developed through her obsession with archiving emotions and her methods of extracting them. Her rogue nature manifests in her unorthodox approach to fortune telling. Freya serves as an effective foil, though her character could be more deeply explored beyond her grief. The amber inkwell functions as both tool and symbol of Sigrid's purpose, effectively extending her characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc from Freya's arrival to her emotional unburdening and departure. The zigzagging questioning technique drives the plot forward naturally. The wine tasting method creates an effective framework for the emotional revelation. However, the story occasionally prioritizes atmospheric description over advancing the central conflict, slightly diluting the narrative tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse creates a vivid, immersive setting with specific sensory details like the "ghostly blue flames" and walls "draped in furs." The northern setting with its aurora-lit sky perfectly complements the tone of ancient wisdom and emotional excavation. The atmosphere effectively balances mysticism with intimate human connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of emotional catharsis and the power of bearing witness to another's pain. The amber inkwell serves as a potent symbol for preserving human experience. While the prose is often evocative, it occasionally veers toward overwritten passages. The ending achieves poignancy but could deliver a more profound insight into the human condition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of emotional archiving and the wine-tasting method of fortune telling. However, some descriptions rely on adjective-heavy constructions ("fierce repose," "modestly flashy") that feel somewhat artificial. The emotional progression follows a somewhat predictable arc, and certain phrases ("a wound Sigrid scribbled") lack the nuance of more authentic writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with atmospheric depth. The Viking setting and fortune-telling premise work harmoniously with the emotional core. While occasionally overwritten, the prose generally serves the story's themes of connection and emotional unburdening. The brevity works well for this intimate exchange, though some passages could be tightened for greater impact.</comment>
