<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's character as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is well-established and her motivation to break from her family's legacy is clear. Her desire to "find her own light" and help the ghost cross over demonstrates consistent characterization. However, her emotional journey feels somewhat predictable, and we don't get enough specific details about her past to fully understand the depth of her "cold legacy" or why she's so drawn to this particular ghost's story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Mara's arrival to helping the ghost find closure, with the amber and letter serving as effective plot devices. The connection between the ghost's unfinished letter and Mara's own desire for freedom creates thematic coherence. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with the ghost's crossing over happening too easily. The story would benefit from more tension or complication before reaching its conclusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery is vividly rendered with "rusted tin ducks" and "cracked counter," creating a potent atmosphere of decay and forgotten joy. The contrast between this setting and the underwater world Mara typically inhabits is effectively implied. The amber's glow against the dim twilight creates a striking visual motif that enhances the supernatural elements. The sensory details effectively evoke both melancholy and a strange beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the amber insect as a metaphor for trapped potential and the shooting gallery as a symbol for missed opportunities. The parallel between Mara and the ghost's desire to break free from expectations creates meaningful thematic resonance. The final image of Mara completing the letter's story "in her mind" offers a satisfying conclusion. However, the emotional impact would be stronger with more specific details about the ghost's unfulfilled dreams and Mara's personal struggles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("joyfully melancholic," "fleeting yet fierce"). The emotional progression follows a somewhat predictable arc of connection and catharsis. The ghost character lacks distinctive personality beyond his regret. The story would benefit from more surprising turns or subversions of the ghost-helping trope. The amber insect metaphor, while effective, is deployed in a somewhat expected manner.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about connection across time and breaking free from expectations. The carnival setting and amber object work particularly well together. The prose is generally strong, though occasionally veers toward purple ("a rebellion against silence sealed in memory"). The story creates a lingering emotional resonance through its parallel character journeys, but could benefit from more specific details about both Mara's diving background and the ghost's carnival life to ground its more abstract themes.</comment>
