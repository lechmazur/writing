<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ebenezer's character is well-developed through his trauma-driven motivation. His grumpiness serves as an effective shield for deeper wounds, and his transformation feels earned. However, his voice lacks some distinctiveness, and the connection between his past trauma and current actions could be more organically revealed rather than explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Ebenezer's guarding of secrets to his confrontation with trauma and spiritual resolution. The jiggling action effectively conveys nervous tension and drives revelation. While the arc is complete, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with the transformation occurring too neatly within the constraints of the word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystal scrying room is vividly rendered with "prismatic light" and "jagged quartz," creating an otherworldly atmosphere that perfectly complements the supernatural elements. The stargazing timeframe enhances the mystical mood, with celestial imagery reinforcing themes of fate and revelation. The sensory details effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the parallel between the restless spirits and Ebenezer's unresolved trauma, creating meaningful subtext. The imagery of the mandala reflecting both stars and inner turmoil is particularly strong. However, the emotional transformation feels somewhat telegraphed rather than organically experienced, and the theme of healing through confrontation, while clear, lacks nuance in its execution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the prose shows moments of originality in its imagery, it occasionally veers into overly ornate territory with phrases like "grandiose subtlety" feeling forced. The emotional journey relies too heavily on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing. The story avoids the most obvious AI patterns but still contains some formulaic elements in its structure and resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear emotional arc. The witch's crystal room and the spiritual elements create a distinctive atmosphere. However, the resolution feels somewhat predictable, and the prose occasionally prioritizes flowery description over emotional depth. The story leaves a lingering impression but doesn't fully capitalize on its intriguing premise.</comment>
