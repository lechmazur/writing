<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marvin's character is well-developed through his contradictions—an elevator technician drawn to fragile sand castles, his "elegantly clumsy demeanor" physically manifesting his internal state. His motivation to free the ghost mirrors his own need for liberation from isolation. However, we could benefit from more insight into what specifically drives his ghost-seeing ability and why this particular ghost resonates with him beyond general loneliness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses naturally from discovery to investigation to resolution, with Marvin's "dissecting" of the ghost's story creating effective forward momentum. The staking out of ghost tours as a method feels organic rather than forced. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with the resolution of both the ghost's and Marvin's emotional burdens providing closure. The pacing effectively balances exposition, investigation, and emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a compelling juxtaposition—fragile art preserved in a sterile environment, mirroring both the ghost's trapped state and Marvin's emotional isolation. Sensory details like "the air hummed with the faint grit of ancient beaches" establish atmosphere immediately. The setting's contrast between preservation and release enhances the theme of letting go, while lunch breaks provide natural timeframes for Marvin's quiet rebellion against his mechanical life.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sand castle as metaphor for preserved but static existence, while the ghost and flower crown symbolize beauty that needs release rather than preservation. The parallel between fixing elevators and "fixing" ghosts creates meaningful subtext about Marvin's approach to life. The resolution avoids sentimentality while delivering emotional impact through the ghost's dissolution and Marvin's newfound lightness. The theme of liberation through acceptance rather than control resonates beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, with fresh metaphors like silence being "a cage" and peace Marvin "hadn't known he craved." Character motivations feel human rather than algorithmic. However, phrases like "complex simplicity" and "elegantly clumsy" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient development to make these paradoxes fully earned. Some descriptions like "fractured peace" and "dissonance of silence" border on purple prose. The ghost's resolution follows a somewhat predictable pattern of supernatural entities finding peace through human intervention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than constructed. The unusual combination of elevator technician, ghost-seeing, and sand castles creates a distinctive narrative environment. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a focused meditation on preservation versus release. The emotional arc feels earned despite the constraints, and the ending provides both resolution and lingering resonance about what we choose to fix versus what we allow to change.</comment>
