<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maris's claustrophobia creates meaningful tension with her underwater explorer identity, and her motivation to study human behavior while dealing with her own trauma feels authentic. The glasses as a talisman effectively reveals her connection to her mentor. However, her character development remains somewhat surface-level, with her transformation feeling slightly rushed rather than deeply earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Maris's trauma to healing through the tea house ritual, with the jam-tasting method effectively driving her transformation. The narrative achieves a complete arc within its constraints. However, the resolution feels somewhat accelerated, with her decision to "dive again" appearing without sufficient buildup of renewed courage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house creates a compelling, surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements Maris's psychological stateâ€”suspended between fear and healing. The contrast between claustrophobic underwater spaces and the open-sky sanctuary is effectively established. Sensory details of moss-covered walls, steaming brews, and jam flavors create immersive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the jam-tasting as both literal action and metaphor for healing, with strong imagery throughout. The theme of finding healing in unexpected places resonates. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by telling rather than showing in places ("her own heart ached"), and some metaphors feel slightly overwrought rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI hallmarks, certain phrases feel formulaic ("lightly heavyhearted," "quietly bold observations"). The tea house owner is somewhat archetypal (the wise elder with knowing eyes). The jam-tasting method is original, but the emotional progression follows predictable patterns, and some descriptions rely on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear emotional arc. The surreal setting and healing ritual create a distinctive atmosphere. However, some transitions feel rushed, and certain emotional revelations would benefit from more nuanced development. The story shows creative potential but needs refinement in execution to reach top-tier literary quality.</comment>
