<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Torvald's character arc from boastful warrior to humbled truth-seeker is well-executed. His motivation to escape his fabricated reality becomes increasingly clear as the story progresses. The lint in his pocket effectively symbolizes his false narratives. However, his transformation feels somewhat accelerated within the constraints, and his initial boastfulness could be more vividly demonstrated through specific examples rather than simply stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Torvald's entrance to his transformed exit, with the "rewiring" action driving his transformation. The wasp's soliloquies catalyze his change effectively. However, the middle section feels slightly rushed, with his epiphany coming too quickly after encountering the ancient wasp. The cause-effect relationship between hearing the wasp's words and his transformation could be more thoroughly developed to strengthen the narrative's coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The wasp nest setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details—the humming, amber walls, balloon pops of hatching eggs. The atmosphere of "precise madness" perfectly complements both the setting and Torvald's internal journey. The hexagonal chambers mirroring his mental chaos creates an effective parallel between external and internal landscapes. The setting becomes an active participant in the character's transformation rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—the lint as accumulated lies, shedding armor as abandoning falsehood. The theme of authenticity versus fabricated identity resonates strongly. The ending provides satisfying closure to Torvald's arc. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows his emotional state, and some metaphors (particularly around the "rewiring" concept) could be more organically integrated into the narrative flow rather than explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls, certain phrases feel overly ornate ("intimately impersonal connection," "crystallized motivation"). The wasp's dialogue is somewhat generic rather than alien or distinctive. The transformation follows a predictable redemption arc without surprising twists. However, the integration of the wasp nest setting with the character's internal journey shows creative originality, and the lint-as-lies metaphor demonstrates thoughtful symbolic development rather than formulaic writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of authenticity and self-deception. The wasp nest setting and the character's journey complement each other effectively. The brevity works in service of the story rather than limiting it. However, certain transitions feel rushed, and some of the language veers toward purple prose. The story leaves readers with the resonant image of a man reborn through confronting his own lies—a satisfying thematic conclusion.</comment>
