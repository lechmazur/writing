<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>@SilentScream has an intriguing premise as a social media exorcist, but her character lacks depth. The "quietly loud" attribute is mentioned but not meaningfully developed. Her motivation to "feed curiosity with life's raw edge" feels generic rather than personal. We get actions but little insight into her internal landscape, making her more of a plot device than a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—preparation, ritual, spirit manifestation, and departure—but lacks meaningful conflict or stakes. The "reigniting" action drives the narrative forward logically, but the story feels more like a procedural sequence than a compelling journey. The connection between the receipt and the spirit provides coherence, though the resolution feels too neat and predictable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall creates an effectively eerie atmosphere that complements the supernatural elements. The lingering chord from the music hall adds temporal depth. Sensory details like flickering candles casting shadows establish mood well. However, the setting remains somewhat underutilized—we get atmosphere but little sense of the space's specific history or significance beyond serving as a backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional resonance despite its supernatural premise. The exorcism ritual proceeds without meaningful complications or revelations. While there's a theme about connecting to forgotten histories, it remains surface-level. The writing relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the spirit's reaction and the audience's engagement. The ending feels perfunctory rather than impactful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from formulaic construction and AI-like qualities. Phrases like "indifferent enthusiasm" create contradictory descriptors that sound poetic but lack authentic meaning. Character emotions are stated rather than demonstrated. The spirit's materialization and reaction follow predictable patterns without surprising developments. The writing lacks a distinctive voice, instead employing generic "spooky" descriptors and overly formal constructions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all assigned elements without feeling overly forced, it fails to transcend its constraints. The supernatural premise has potential, but the execution lacks originality and emotional depth. The writing is competent but uninspired, with little subtext or lingering impact. The story reads like a sketch rather than a fully realized narrative, missing opportunities to explore the intriguing concept of a social media exorcist in meaningful ways.</comment>
