<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spectral observer is well-established with a clear motivation and distinct voice. Their non-corporeal nature shapes their actions appropriately, and their purpose to rescue ancient traditions drives the narrative. However, the character lacks some emotional depth beyond their stated mission, and their personality remains somewhat abstract despite the first-person narration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with the flinging of the whistle as the central action, effectively connected to the character's motivation. The cause-effect relationship between the whale's call, the dancer's step, and the narrator's intervention is logically established. However, the resolution feels somewhat abstract and the stakes remain nebulous, leaving the plot's impact slightly diminished.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly rendered with sensory details like "salt-laced stone," "swirling fog," and "dust motes" that create a vivid, atmospheric world. The juxtaposition of the ancient lighthouse with the modern plastic whistle creates meaningful tension, and the setting perfectly complements the ghostly narrator and themes of tradition and remembrance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively employs metaphor and imagery, particularly in connecting the literal lighthouse with the metaphorical guiding of souls. The central theme of preserving wisdom against forgetting is well-developed. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by abstract language, and the story occasionally tells rather than shows its thematic concerns. The ending, while poetic, lacks the punch that would elevate it to exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose demonstrates creativity in its metaphors and concept, it occasionally veers into overly ornate territory with phrases like "the crushing tide of forgetting" and "the void of apathy." Some descriptions feel somewhat generic despite their poetic quality. The story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but doesn't fully establish a distinctive authorial voice that transcends its literary influences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a consistent tone and thematic focus. The supernatural framework effectively accommodates disparate elements like the whale's call and the dancer's performance. While the narrative leaves readers with lingering questions about tradition and remembrance, it sometimes sacrifices narrative clarity for poetic language, and the abstract nature of the conflict limits its emotional impact.</comment>
