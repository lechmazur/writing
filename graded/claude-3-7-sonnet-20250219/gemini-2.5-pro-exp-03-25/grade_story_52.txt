<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pip's hopeful nature contrasts effectively with his pickpocketing, creating an interesting tension. His motivation to share the secret feels authentic, though his immediate trust in the abrasive Elara could use more development. The broken pencil sharpener as a worry stone adds subtle characterization. Elara's "tastefully offensive" attribute manifests well in her dialogue, though her quick shift from antagonist to confidant feels somewhat rushed.</comment>

The setting and the secret are meaningfully connected through the gold/sand transformation.</comment>
