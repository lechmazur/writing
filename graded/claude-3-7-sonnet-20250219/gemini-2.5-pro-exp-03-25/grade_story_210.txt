<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is effectively established as an amiable scholar whose motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams drives his presence in the lighthouse. His scholarly approach to the supernatural shows consistency with his character. However, his personality lacks deeper dimensions beyond his academic curiosity, and his emotional reactions to the supernatural phenomena remain somewhat superficial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elias's contemplative beginning to the supernatural manifestation (vibration) to his reception of spectral stories. The progression feels natural within the word constraint, with the vibrations effectively driving the narrative forward. The connection between his scholarly purpose and the supernatural revelation creates satisfying coherence, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-realized through sensory details like "salt-laced wind" and the groaning of aged wood. The atmosphere of isolation and supernatural tension perfectly complements the concept of navigating shadows. The physical environment actively participates in the narrative through the vibrating timbers, creating a richly immersive world where setting and action are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses imagery and metaphor to convey the supernatural experience. The contrast between academic pursuit and spectral encounter creates compelling tension. The narrative shows rather than tells Elias's experience through sensory details and physical manifestations. While the theme of connecting past and present through supernatural means is clear, the emotional impact could be deeper, and the ending, though poetic, lacks a truly resonant conclusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates some originality in its approach to the ghost story genre, but occasionally relies on overly ornate language ("the psychic residue left by countless keepers"). There are moments of purple prose and some generic emotional descriptors. While the concept is interesting, the execution sometimes feels formulaic, particularly in how the supernatural manifestation unfolds in a predictable pattern. The narrative voice lacks a truly distinctive style that would elevate it beyond competent genre writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about scholarly investigation of the supernatural. The lighthouse setting and ghostly manifestations work particularly well together. However, some elements feel less organically incorporated (like the crossword page that's quickly abandoned). The writing shows creative thinking in connecting academic pursuit with supernatural experience, but occasionally sacrifices authenticity for literary flourish.</comment>
