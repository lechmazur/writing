<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's character is well-developed through her exile status and passionate devotion to tracking butterflies. Her motivation is clear and consistent, with her actions (marking butterflies despite prohibition) revealing her as a rebel scientist finding meaning amid societal collapse. The highlighter pen's repurposing cleverly demonstrates her resourcefulness. However, we lack deeper insight into her backstory and emotional complexity beyond her scientific passion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "infect" action to drive the narrative forward, with a clear beginning (preparation), middle (sighting butterflies), and end (successful marking). The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints. The connection between Elara's exile and her butterfly research creates logical cause-and-effect. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the resolution, while poetic, doesn't fully explore consequences of her forbidden research.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is richly rendered with sensory detailsâ€”humming engines, hissing oxygen recyclers, brass pipes, and riveted steel under flickering gaslights. The juxtaposition of crushing oceanic depths with delicate butterflies creates compelling tension. The timeframe "between broken treaties" effectively establishes political context without exposition. The bioluminescent environment and the submarine's technological elements merge seamlessly to create an immersive, unique atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the butterflies as metaphors for fragile beauty persisting amid destruction, creating emotional resonance. The contrast between Elara's underwater exile and the butterflies' freedom adds thematic depth. The ending leaves readers with a lingering sense of defiant hope. However, the conflict remains somewhat abstract, and while the prose is often lyrical ("tiny beacons against the overwhelming gloom"), some metaphors could be more original.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its underwater steampunk setting and the unexpected concept of deep-sea butterflies. The prose avoids AI-typical patterns with specific, contextual details rather than generic descriptions. The emotional nuance of Elara's "fierce, protective wonder" feels authentic. However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward purple prose ("a face etched with weariness but illuminated by..."), and the concept of butterflies following thermal vents stretches biological plausibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive voice and setting. The steampunk submarine and butterfly tracking create a unique juxtaposition that serves the theme of beauty amid destruction. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting. While some elements (like the morse code) could be more deeply integrated, the overall effect is a memorable, atmospheric piece that leaves readers with the lingering image of luminous butterflies as symbols of resilience.</comment>
