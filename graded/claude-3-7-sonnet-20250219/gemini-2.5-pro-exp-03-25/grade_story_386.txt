<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's character is well-developed through her quiet defiance and connection to her lost civilization. Her motivation to preserve her people's memory is clear and consistent, driving her meticulous plan. The tablecloth reveals her as both historian and rebel. However, we could benefit from more insight into her emotional state beyond determination—moments of doubt or vulnerability would add dimension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably coherent for the word limit, with the catapult action serving as a perfect climax. The narrative flows logically from Elara's situation to her plan to the execution, with the tablecloth cleverly connecting all elements. The story achieves a complete arc with a resonant conclusion that feels both final and open-ended, suggesting consequences beyond what we witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse in fractured time creates an exceptional atmosphere of isolation and liminality. Sensory details like the "hum of the atomic core" and the "borrowed dawn" establish a haunting mood that perfectly complements Elara's situation. The setting and timeframe work symbiotically, creating a space that exists outside normal time—ideal for a time refugee's story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through its layered symbolism and evocative imagery. The tablecloth as both star chart and cultural artifact creates rich subtext about memory and history. The ending resonates emotionally while leaving space for reader interpretation. The theme of defiance against erasure emerges organically from the narrative elements rather than being explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, particularly in how it transforms the lighthouse and tablecloth into temporal devices. However, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("the taste of borrowed dawn lingering"), and certain descriptions rely on somewhat generic cosmic imagery. The emotional landscape could be more nuanced rather than consistently stoic and determined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The lingering questions about whether Elara's plan will succeed and what exactly she hopes to change give the story depth beyond its word count. A few moments of overwritten prose prevent a higher score.</comment>
