<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's character as a sincere rebel is well-established through her fierce dedication to preserving traditions. Her motivation to save the Guildhall's architectural legacy feels authentic and drives her actions consistently. However, her emotional depth could be further developed beyond the initial "braided bitterness," and Kael remains somewhat underdeveloped as a secondary character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from discovery to exploration to revelation, with the theorizing action effectively driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from problem (decaying traditions) to action (exploring the passage) to resolution (discovering the resonant technique). The pacing effectively balances exposition and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage is vividly rendered with sensory details that create genuine atmosphere: "dust motes dancing," "shadows writhed," and "the air growing instantly colder." The setting perfectly complements both the concept of confronting fear and the preservation of architectural traditions. The timeframe between storms creates natural tension and symbolically mirrors the characters' situation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses architectural metaphors that double as thematic elementsâ€”the Keystone Arch technique parallels the characters' attempt to become keystones of preservation. The central conflict between tradition and apathy is well-established, and the resolution offers hope without being simplistic. The story successfully "shows" the characters' determination through their actions rather than telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, some phrases like "her heart a knot of braided bitterness" feel slightly overwrought. The architectural elements are handled with specificity that suggests research or knowledge, lending authenticity. However, the concept of "acoustic resonance" as the explanation for hauntings is somewhat predictable, and the characters' dialogue occasionally serves exposition rather than revealing personality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The architectural preservation theme provides a meaningful framework that elevates the story beyond its plot mechanics. While some prose could be tightened, the story creates a lingering impression about the value of tradition and the courage required to preserve it. The ending effectively balances immediate resolution with the suggestion of ongoing challenges.</comment>
