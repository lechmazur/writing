<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jedediah is exceptionally well-realized through his connection to both earth and technology. His character embodies the tension between tradition and preservation, with clear motivation to restore ancestral voices.

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The northern lights platform creates a sublime backdrop that perfectly enhances the transcendent nature of connecting with ancestors. Sensory details are exceptional—the "ghostly green glow," the "sharp, cold air mixed with the faint scent of chemicals," the contrast between silence and recovered sound. The setting physically elevates Jedediah between earth and sky, mirroring his position between past and present. The atmosphere of isolation and vastness amplifies the intimacy of hearing long-lost voices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of continuity across generations. The metaphor of the aurora borealis as witness to both present and past creates powerful symbolism. The central conflict—the battle against decay and silence—resolves beautifully with the recovered voices. The theme of preservation as an act of love resonates deeply. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments of emotional revelation, allowing readers to experience Jedediah's triumph alongside him.</comment>

The language is precise without becoming purple, with fresh metaphors like voices "weaving a tapestry of sound." The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic.

The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout, with sensory details that feel specific rather than generic.</comment>
