<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed through his spectral sensitivity and its connection to his motivation. His character trait of being "elegantly clumsy" manifests naturally in his movements around the lab. His yearning for liberation through helping ghosts creates a compelling psychological dimension. However, we could benefit from more insight into how his ghost-seeing ability has shaped his life choices beyond his current situation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc despite the word constraint—Elias discovers a ghost, investigates her story, and works toward resolution. The staking out of ghost tours as a method drives the narrative forward logically. The connection between the beginning (discovering the ghost) and the potential end (helping her find peace) is well-established. However, the resolution remains somewhat theoretical rather than actualized within the story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a hauntingly effective juxtaposition—fragile structures meticulously preserved alongside ephemeral spirits. The "dissonance of silence" concept permeates the atmosphere brilliantly, with the lab's stillness contrasted against the spectral whispers. Sensory details like the "climate-controlled stillness" and the "low hum" of the ghost's presence create a richly immersive setting that enhances the supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sand castles as metaphors for preservation versus impermanence, creating resonant subtext about mortality and memory. The parallel between Elias's gentle handling of fallen sand and his desire to help the ghost creates emotional depth. The unresolved ending feels purposeful rather than incomplete. The story skillfully shows rather than tells Elias's emotional state through his actions and observations, though dialogue might have added another dimension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids common ghost story tropes by focusing on the emotional connection between the living and dead rather than fear. The metaphor comparing sand castles to spirits is fresh and specific to this narrative. The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate but generally maintains purposeful clarity. The narrative demonstrates a consistent tone and thoughtful handling of supernatural elements without resorting to clichés. The concept of a ghost permanently holding a dried flower crown feels original and specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a snapshot of an ongoing situation with implications beyond what's shown. The juxtaposition of the meticulous preservation lab with ephemeral ghosts creates thematic resonance about permanence and letting go. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about both Elias's and the ghost's ultimate fates, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
