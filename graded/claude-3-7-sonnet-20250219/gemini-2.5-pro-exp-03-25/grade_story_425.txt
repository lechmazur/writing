<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sir Kaelen's morose nature is effectively established and consistent throughout, with his "faith curdled into duty" providing psychological depth. His motivation to restore ancient systems drives his actions logically. However, his character could be more fully revealed through his reaction to the scavenger—the interaction feels somewhat mechanical rather than revealing deeper layers of his personality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Kaelen's solitary work to the encounter with the scavenger and culminates in the beginning restoration. The blackout and flare create natural tension, and cause-effect relationships are logical. However, the scavenger's presence feels somewhat underdeveloped—their purpose beyond creating conflict isn't fully integrated into the narrative's resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting is richly detailed with "constellations now only accessible through archival data" and machinery "silent beneath layers of dust." The post-stellar-naming timeframe creates a melancholic atmosphere that perfectly complements Kaelen's character. The blackout and subsequent blue light from reactivating systems create a vivid visual progression that enhances the mood of revival from obsolescence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension through the blackout and unexpected encounter, with the restoration sequence providing a satisfying conclusion. The imagery of darkness giving way to blue light creates powerful symbolism of rebirth. However, the thematic exploration of duty versus purpose remains somewhat surface-level, and the scavenger's role feels more like a plot device than an integral part of the story's meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The writing shows originality in its post-stellar civilization setting and the juxtaposition of ancient astronomical technology with scavenging. However, some phrasing feels unnecessarily ornate ("lavishly austere," "bored excitement"), and the scavenger character lacks individuality, appearing as a generic intruder rather than a person with specific motivations. The emotional arc relies more on stated feelings than demonstrated reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinct atmosphere and setting. The observatory, blackout, and restoration sequence work particularly well together. The ending provides a satisfying sense of beginning rather than conclusion, appropriate to the restoration theme. However, some elements (particularly the needle) feel somewhat forced into the narrative rather than essential to it.</comment>
