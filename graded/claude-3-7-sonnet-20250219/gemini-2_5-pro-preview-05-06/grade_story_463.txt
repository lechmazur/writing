<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas is effectively portrayed as a dry-witted sentinel with a methodical approach to supernatural resolution. His motivation to learn traditional methods is consistent and shapes his actions. The character exhibits a distinctive voice through internal musings and dialogue that reveal his analytical yet somewhat detached personality. However, deeper psychological complexity and emotional stakes could strengthen his characterization beyond the functional role he serves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Silas's crossing off the final name with his confiscation of the rope, creating a coherent narrative arc within the word constraint. The dance as method of spectral resolution provides an interesting framework. The story achieves a sense of resolution as Silas completes his task. However, the exact mechanics of how the dance works to resolve hauntings could be more clearly integrated, and some causal relationships remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom is vividly established with effective sensory details like "dust motes dancing in the sliver of moonlight." The setting perfectly complements the supernatural concept and enhances the tone of "reckless precision." The rope's connection to the keeper's suicide creates meaningful integration between object and setting. The atmosphere powerfully supports both the ghostly premise and Silas's methodical character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively creates an intriguing atmosphere and establishes a unique approach to ghost hunting. The concept of using a dance to resolve hauntings is memorable, and the imagery of the frayed rope as both tool and trophy adds symbolic weight. The theme of addressing broken promises through understanding rather than force comes through clearly. However, the emotional stakes could be heightened, and some explanations feel slightly expository rather than organically revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases like "the oppressive sorrow slightly lifted" and "an archivist of forgotten techniques" feel somewhat formulaic. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. Some descriptions, while evocative, lean toward the unnecessarily ornate. The concept of spectral resolution through dance shows originality, but the execution sometimes defaults to predictable gothic fiction phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinct atmosphere and character. The lighthouse setting, the mysterious list, and the supernatural resolution through dance work together effectively. The brevity feels appropriate rather than limiting. While the prose occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate, the story leaves readers with intriguing questions about Silas's broader mission and the nature of hauntings tied to broken promises, suggesting depth beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
