<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alabaster's motivation to find truth is clear and consistently drives his actions. His telepathic abilities are well-integrated with his character and the story's events. However, his emotional depth could be further developed beyond the "tragically joyful" descriptor, which feels somewhat abstract rather than demonstrated through specific reactions or interior thoughts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within its constraints, moving from observation to intervention through telepathy and calligraphy. The weatherizing of archives provides a clear antagonistic force, and the resolution with the symbol being recognized creates satisfying closure. The causal relationships are logical, though the plot's middle section could benefit from slightly more development of stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is richly evoked through sensory details like "coal smoke" and "cheerful clang of automatons." The juxtaposition of the mechanical city against ancient truths creates effective tension. The atmosphere of "gloomy cheerfulness" permeates throughout, making the setting feel integral rather than decorative. The world-building efficiently establishes both physical setting and socio-political context.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of truth versus power and the preservation of history. The symbol as a catalyst for change creates meaningful subtext. The contrast between immobility and influence is a strong thematic undercurrent. However, the emotional impact would be stronger with more specific details about the forbidden history and what exactly is at stake if it remains buried.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("his stone heart beating with a tragically joyful rhythm"). The use of telepathy avoids some common tropes by focusing on subtle influence rather than mind control. The story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The characters' reactions have human nuance, but some descriptive language veers toward purple prose that slightly undermines authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The central conflict about truth versus official narrative feels timely and meaningful. The brevity works well for this particular story, creating a snapshot of potential change rather than requiring a fully resolved plot. The lingering sense of hope at the end provides satisfying closure while inviting the reader to imagine broader consequences.</comment>
