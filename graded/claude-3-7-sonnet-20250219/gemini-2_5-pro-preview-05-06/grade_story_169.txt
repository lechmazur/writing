<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair's characterization as a soul-broker with "grandiose modesty" is consistently executed. His motivation to preserve forgotten songs shapes his actions effectively throughout. His methodical approach to coaxing melodies from bottles reveals his patient, curatorial nature. The character possesses a distinct voice through his musings, though his emotional depth could be further developed beyond his professional facade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc within the tight constraints—from Alistair examining the bottle to successfully extracting and cataloging the song. The choreographing action drives the narrative forward naturally. Cause-effect relationships are logical within the established cosmic framework. The story achieves satisfying closure with the bottle's purpose fulfilled and the cycle continuing, creating a complete narrative circle despite brevity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ethereal setting of a static floating tea platform amid cosmic swirls creates an effective contrast that enhances the story's otherworldly atmosphere. The timeframe of "recycling epochs" complements the concept of preserving experiences across vast time scales. Sensory details are well-deployed, particularly the visual elements of dust motes and backward script, creating a palpable atmosphere of antiquity and cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively evokes contemplation about memory, preservation, and the recycling of experience. The metaphor of real estate for soul transactions works brilliantly. The central conflict between loss and preservation is subtly handled, with Alistair's work representing a poignant solution. The narrative shows rather than tells emotion through Alistair's careful actions and the revealed song's content. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting the eternal continuation of the cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its cosmic framework and the novel concept of reading reversed bottle labels to extract lost songs. The metaphors are fresh and specific to the narrative world. While generally avoiding clichés, some phrases like "heartbreakingly expressed" and "his vast ethereal library" veer toward the generic. The writing maintains consistent tone throughout, though occasionally the prose becomes slightly ornate when describing cosmic elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole where each element feels purposeful rather than forced. The cosmic soul-broker concept provides an original framework that accommodates the unusual combination of elements naturally. The brevity works as a strength, offering a glimpse into an intriguing eternal process without overexplaining. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of experience, memory, and preservation across cosmic cycles.</comment>
