<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair's character is well-developed through his relationship with ghosts, showing consistent motivation throughout. His perception of silent ghosts "screaming in the void" effectively reveals his emotional burden. The character's transformation from analytical dissection to acceptance is nuanced and believable. However, his "elegant clumsiness" feels more told than demonstrated in meaningful ways, and some deeper personal history would strengthen his characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear and satisfying arc from Alistair's analytical approach to ghosts (dissection through observation) to his epiphany about acceptance. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, moving from problem to resolution with logical progression. The connection between the beginning's discomfort and the ending's "quiet harmony" creates effective narrative closure. The pacing occasionally feels rushed in transitions, particularly in the shift from observation to epiphany.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Sand Castle Preservation Lab provides an inspired setting that beautifully complements the theme of fragility and impermanence. The juxtaposition of silence with "spectral sighs" creates a rich atmospheric tension. Sensory details like "salty air" and the brittle flower crown effectively ground the ethereal elements. The lab's preservation work mirrors Alistair's own attempt to categorize and understand the ghosts, creating layered meaning within the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves exceptional thematic depth, exploring impermanence, acceptance, and shared human fragility through the ghost metaphor. The narrative skillfully uses the contrast between visible/invisible and silence/noise to create emotional resonance. The symbolic parallels between the sandcastles, dried flower crown, and ghosts form a cohesive metaphorical landscape. The resolution offers genuine emotional catharsis without being heavy-handed, leaving the reader with lingering questions about acceptance and the nature of peace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its approach to the ghost narrative, avoiding predictable horror tropes for a more contemplative exploration of connection. The prose balances literary quality with accessibility, using fresh metaphors like "the dissonance of silence" effectively. Character emotions are shown through actions and observations rather than stated directly. The story occasionally relies on abstract language that could be more concrete, but overall maintains a distinctive voice and avoids common AI-writing pitfalls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional integration of assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. Each element contributes meaningfully to the central themes of impermanence and acceptance. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with efficient prose that carries emotional weight. The story's emotional and philosophical resonance lingers well beyond its conclusion, suggesting depths not fully explored but thoughtfully implied. Some transitions between scenes could be smoother, but the overall accomplishment within the constraints is remarkable.</comment>
