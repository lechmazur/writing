<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alistair's characterization as an uptight scribe is well-established through both explicit description ("spine seemed starched") and his methodical approach to investigation. His transformation from rigid bureaucrat to empathetic protector shows meaningful development. However, his initial motivation for cataloging the witch's effects could be more clearly connected to his personal stakes, and his internal struggle could have more nuance before the revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story creates a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from suspicion to revelation to purpose. The method of analyzing adhesive drives the plot forward organically and connects cleverly to the discovery. The causal relationship between the lightbulb, pollen, and the witch's purpose is well-established, though the final connection to empathy feels slightly rushed despite the elegant buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with the greenhouse setting juxtaposed against gravestones creates immediate tension and intrigue. Sensory details like "scent of damp earth" and "luminous fungi" bring the environment to life. The setting perfectly reflects both the character's internal state and the story's themes, with the greenhouse serving as both a literal and metaphorical vessel for growth amidst death.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story effectively builds to an emotional and thematic revelation that resonates beyond its brief length. Rich symbolism (light as understanding, cultivation as nurturing empathy) supports the transformation theme. The narrative shows rather than tells Alistair's emotional journey through his actions and reactions. The ending provides both resolution and a new beginning, though the final thematic statement about empathy could benefit from more subtle development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most common AI pitfalls with consistently vivid and specific imagery. However, certain phrases ("the foundations of his logical world trembling yet solidifying") veer toward purple prose. While the narrative successfully subverts expectations about witches and scribes, the final revelation about empathy feels somewhat predictable and on-the-nose rather than emerging organically from the established elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The marriage of scientific investigation with magical elements creates an intriguing tension that supports the character's transformation. While occasionally overwritten, the prose generally supports the atmosphere of wonder and discovery. The ending provides both resolution and a meaningful new beginning for the character, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
