<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his spiritually secular worldview and his passionate defense of physical books. His motivation to preserve the flying library is clear and consistent. The coffee stain reading reveals his connection to tradition while his "re-storying" action demonstrates agency. However, his emotional depth could be further explored beyond his professional mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the pivotal vote as tension, with the coffee reading and button discovery creating a satisfying arc. The obliteration/re-storying action drives the narrative forward logically. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, moving from problem to action to resolution with clear causality and purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport baggage claim brilliantly mirrors Tiber's situationâ€”waiting for something crucial in a place designed for transitions. Sensory details like "dust-choked carousels" and the tactile quality of the button create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the themes of preservation versus progress. The setting becomes a metaphorical crossroads between past and future.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the tension between technological progress and cultural preservation through meaningful symbolism. The button as a fragment of interrupted journey parallels the library's threatened existence. The "re-storying" concept provides thematic depth, suggesting active participation in shaping narratives rather than passive acceptance. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction while maintaining subtlety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of a flying book-library and the notion of "re-storying." However, phrases like "fractal sorrow" and "tactile connection" feel somewhat formulaic. The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. While the premise is inventive, the execution sometimes falls into predictable patterns of literary fiction about preservation versus progress.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The flying library, coffee reading, and button discovery feel organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused meditation on preservation that leaves readers with lingering questions about the value of physical artifacts in an increasingly digital world.</comment>
