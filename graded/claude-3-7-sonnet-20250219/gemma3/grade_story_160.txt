<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber is well-developed through his unique perspective on finality and his methodical approach to preserving memories. His motivation to acknowledge rather than restore the past is clear and consistent. His analytical freedom manifests in how he perceives "echoes of lives lived in the static of the present." However, we could benefit from more insight into what personal experiences shaped his unusual worldview.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively centers on Tiber's act of acknowledgment through discovering and connecting with Captain Elara's goggles. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, moving from discovery to connection to affirmation. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the established metaphysical framework. The pacing feels measured and appropriate, though the resolution could be slightly more impactful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay perfectly complements the theme of preserving what others consider broken or finished. Sensory details are particularly strong—the metallic thrum of the briefcase, the warmth of the goggles, the skeletal remains of gears—creating a liminal space between functionality and obsolescence. The post-performance timeframe reinforces the theme of what persists after apparent endings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of memory, persistence, and the artificial nature of endings. Strong imagery (particularly the "sanctuary" of forgotten things) and the metaphor of Tiber as a "guardian of fading light" create emotional resonance. The narrative shows rather than tells Tiber's connection to Elara through sensory experience. The ending delivers a satisfying affirmation of the story's central premise without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and unique conceptual approach. The language is evocative without becoming purple prose. However, certain phrases like "prickly wonder" and "defiance of the laws" feel slightly forced rather than organically arising from the narrative. The story's metaphysical framework is original, though the execution occasionally relies on abstract description rather than concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores an original concept about the persistence of memory and identity beyond conventional endings. The brevity works in its favor, creating a meditative, moment-in-time quality that reinforces the theme. While the concept is intellectually engaging, it could benefit from a slightly stronger emotional hook to elevate it from interesting to truly memorable.</comment>
