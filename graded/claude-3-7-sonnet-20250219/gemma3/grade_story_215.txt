<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Father Michael's characterization as a "rattled exorcist" is well-established and consistent throughout. His discomfort with frivolity contrasted with his "inwardly social" nature creates an interesting tension. His reluctant collaboration with Dr. Thorne reveals character growth as he moves from begrudging participation to finding purpose. However, his "coy aggression" feels underdeveloped, and his internal conflict could be more deeply explored beyond surface-level observations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the puzzle-solving framework to drive narrative momentum. The progression from postcard to hidden room creates a satisfying arc with clear cause-effect relationships. The synthesis of Evelyn's memories provides both motivation and resolution. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, though the dance lessons subplot feels somewhat disconnected from the main narrative thread despite attempts to integrate it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Blackwood Institute is vividly rendered as a setting that perfectly balances scientific sterility with supernatural mystery. The contrast between "shadows" and "sequins" establishes atmosphere immediately. The labyrinthine structure housing hidden puzzles creates a physical manifestation of the story's themes. Sensory details like the "silk feeling offensively frivolous" and the ultraviolet-revealed message effectively immerse the reader in this world where science and wonder intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully explores the tension between faith and empiricism, creating meaningful thematic resonance. The puzzles serve as both plot devices and metaphors for the careful unveiling of knowledge. The parallel between Michael and Evelyn creates emotional depth, and the ending offers both resolution and new purpose. The writing shows restraint in exposition, allowing readers to discover connections alongside the protagonist. However, some metaphors feel slightly overwrought, and the dance lesson motif, while interesting, isn't fully integrated into the thematic framework.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, avoiding predictable supernatural tropes. However, some phrasing feels unnecessarily ornate ("the silk feeling offensively frivolous"), and certain transitions between puzzle-solving sequences read somewhat formulaically. The character's emotional journey shows nuance, but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. While the concept is fresh, the execution sometimes falls into predictable patterns of revelation and discovery typical of mystery narratives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The puzzles, psychic research, and character development work in harmony rather than feeling forced. The prose, while occasionally overwritten, generally serves the atmospheric needs of the story. The ending effectively balances resolution with new possibility, leaving readers with lingering questions about the intersection of science and the supernatural. A more seamless integration of the dance lessons would have elevated the overall cohesion.</comment>
