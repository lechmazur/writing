<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber is effectively characterized as an "underestimated rebel" through his quiet defiance and strategic thinking. His motivation to disrupt the Authority is clear, though his emotional depth could be further developed. His connection to the pocket knife reveals his resourcefulness, and his relationship with Elara adds dimension. The character possesses a distinct voice through his philosophical outlook on adaptation versus resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses "intensify" as Tiber strengthens the signal against the Authority. The story achieves a complete arc from the initial phone call to the final confirmation ring, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. However, some plot elements feel underdeveloped within the word constraint - particularly the nature of "the signal" and its specific effects. The pacing works well, building tension as Tiber deploys his resonators.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is masterfully utilized, with its "labyrinthine corridors" and "decaying animatronics" serving both as physical protection and metaphor for rebellion. The "ephemeral gloom" tone perfectly complements the resistance narrative. Sensory details like "the scent of mildew and forgotten cotton candy" create immersive atmosphere. The abandoned amusement park effectively symbolizes a society that has lost its joy under authoritarian rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively evokes tension between hope and oppression. Literary devices like the watching doll's eye create memorable imagery. The ending feels purposeful, suggesting continuation of resistance. The central conflict between adaptation and control is well-established. The theme of finding freedom through subtle disruption rather than direct confrontation is compelling. However, the exact nature of "the signal" remains somewhat abstract, limiting emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The writing shows originality in its approach to resistance through adaptation rather than direct confrontation. The metaphors are fresh, particularly using Szechuan cuisine as a symbol of defiance against "bland conformity." However, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("a bittersweet symphony of hope and sorrow"). The emotional resonance is genuine, particularly in Tiber's quiet determination. The story avoids predictable resistance narrative patterns by focusing on subtle disruption rather than dramatic confrontation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about quiet rebellion. The haunted house, Szechuan cuisine, and signal technology all serve the central theme of adaptation versus control. The brevity works well for this snapshot of resistance. The writing occasionally becomes too abstract when describing the signal's purpose, but overall maintains clarity. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the rebellion's future and the nature of adaptation as resistance.</comment>
