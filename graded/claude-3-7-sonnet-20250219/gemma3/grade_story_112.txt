<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tiber's character has a clear motivation and the "factually imaginative" attribute manifests well in his approach to decoding recipes. His emotional connection to the handkerchief adds depth, though his character development remains somewhat static. His reactions to discoveries feel authentic, but his personality could be more distinctly rendered beyond his mission-focused determination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from arrival to discovery to emotional resolution, with the decoding process driving narrative tension. The connection between hopscotch patterns and recipes is inventive, though the transition from decoding to cooking happens rather abruptly. The story achieves satisfying closure within its constraints, with Tiber's tear providing emotional punctuation to his accomplishment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Writing System Archive setting is richly established and perfectly suits the preservation theme. The opening timeframe (melting snowflake) creates an immediate sensory impression of transition that mirrors the story's themes. Sensory details—particularly the aromas of cooking and the tactile elements of ancient artifacts—create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional weight of cultural preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of cultural memory, preservation, and connection to heritage through tangible practices. The metaphor of recipes as encoded knowledge works brilliantly, and the emotional payoff feels earned. The narrative shows rather than tells Tiber's emotional journey, particularly in the final scenes. While the conflict is subtle, the tension between preservation and loss creates sufficient stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, with consistent characterization and natural emotional progression. However, phrases like "mournful elation" appear twice, suggesting limited vocabulary range. Some descriptions ("factually imaginative") feel somewhat artificial rather than organic to the narrative. The concept is original, but the execution occasionally relies on expected emotional beats rather than surprising developments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The preservation theme resonates beyond the text, inviting reflection on cultural memory and loss. While some transitions could be smoother and certain descriptions more nuanced, the overall effect is of a thoughtful, emotionally resonant piece that uses its brevity effectively to create a complete narrative arc.</comment>
