<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his deliberate isolation and relationship with his collection. His motivation to battle despair is clear and consistent. The black rose serves as an effective symbol of his past, and his measured response to the invitation reveals his methodical nature. His internal conflict between isolation and engagement is nuanced, though his dialogue is limited and his transformation somewhat predictable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the invitation as a catalyst for Tiber's journey outside his comfort zone. The story achieves a complete arc within the constraints, moving from isolation to engagement and back to a modified solitude. The board game rounds provide a unique framing device for his decision-making process. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed, with his adaptation happening too smoothly given his seventeen years of isolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair as a setting is brilliantly juxtaposed with its "improbably warm interior," creating a physical manifestation of Tiber's protected inner world. The contrast between his quiet lair and the gaudy party effectively heightens tension. Sensory details like "dust motes," "chipped porcelain," and "clinking of champagne glasses" create immersive atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements the theme of isolation versus engagement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the black rose as a multifaceted symbol, representing both pain and beauty found in darkness. The board game metaphor for life decisions adds depth. The narrative successfully shows rather than tells Tiber's emotional journey, particularly in his physical reactions at the party. The theme of solitude versus isolation is thoughtfully explored, though the ending, while satisfying, could have delivered a more profound insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates originality in its metaphors (fortress against "gnawing teeth of despair") and the board game framing device. However, some phrasing feels overly formal ("a deliberate embrace of solitude"), and certain emotional transitions happen too smoothly for someone who hasn't spoken to another person in seventeen years. The character's adaptation at the party lacks the awkwardness or discomfort that would make his experience more authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about isolation and cautious reengagement with society. The black rose and board game serve as effective anchoring symbols. While the prose occasionally becomes too ornate, it generally supports the character's methodical nature. The story leaves readers with the lingering question of whether Tiber's modified approach to solitude will sustain him, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
