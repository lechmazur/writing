<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's character is well-developed through his curious nature and unique hobby. His transformation from collector to preserver shows meaningful growth. His "loudly serene" attribute manifests in his calm approach to both death and the supernatural. However, we could benefit from more specific examples of his serenity in action rather than just being told about it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Tiber's search to his revelation and transformation. The imitation of Hemlock's gesture creates a perfect turning point that drives the character's epiphany. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The resolution feels earned rather than rushed, with Tiber's changed perspective providing satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is exceptionally rendered with vivid, otherworldly details that elevate it beyond a mere setting to become almost a character itself. The singing spirits, vanishing footprints, and golden embers create a richly atmospheric liminal space that perfectly complements the theme of dreams and revelation. The sensory details are specific and evocative without becoming purple prose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of collection versus preservation, curiosity versus respect, and the ethics of ownership. The metaphor of dreams as something that can be stolen rather than merely observed provides depth. The transformation feels earned through the "rustle of revelation" moment. The story shows rather than tells Tiber's emotional journey, particularly in his realization about his collecting habits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids common tropes about supernatural encounters by focusing on ethical questions rather than fear or power. Phrases like "polite anarchy" and "rustle of revelation" feel fresh rather than formulaic. The narrative maintains a consistent dreamy yet grounded tone throughout. Some descriptions like "a feeling of understanding blooming in his chest" verge on telling rather than showing, but most emotional content is conveyed through action and realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the subject matter. The ethical question at its core—whether collecting dreams is a form of theft—provides intellectual and emotional resonance that lingers beyond the final sentence. The transformation of the protagonist feels earned rather than contrived.</comment>
