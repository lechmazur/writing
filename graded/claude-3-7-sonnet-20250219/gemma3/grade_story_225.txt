<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber's characterization as a wayward apothecary is well-established and consistent. His unjust fairness manifests naturally in his respect for small creatures, and his motivation to track butterflies drives his actions logically. His transformation from solitary scientist to risk-taker for love shows meaningful development. However, we lack deeper insight into his internal conflicts or past that would elevate him beyond an interesting archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the Morse code communication to drive the narrative forward, creating a coherent arc from initial discovery to planned rendezvous. The infection metaphor works elegantly as Lyra's passion spreads to Tiber. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships and well-managed pacing that builds to a satisfying climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is exceptionally realized through specific details like "brass and glass" and the bioluminescent environment. The timeframe "between broken treaties" creates meaningful tension and stakes. Sensory details—particularly visual elements like the glowing butterflies reflecting in Tiber's spectacles—immerse the reader completely. The atmosphere perfectly balances wonder and danger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of connection amid isolation. The highlighter pen and Morse code become powerful symbols of their unconventional communication. The narrative effectively shows rather than tells Tiber's emotional journey through his actions and subtle expressions. The theme of finding meaning and connection despite political barriers resonates beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates originality in its steampunk-meets-romance concept and avoids predictable patterns. The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate but generally maintains purposeful clarity. Emotional development feels authentic rather than stated. The story shows individual style in its integration of scientific observation with romantic longing. Some metaphors could be fresher, but overall the narrative voice remains consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a snapshot of a larger world. The creative combination of steampunk, romance, and scientific observation demonstrates thoughtful craft. The ending leaves readers with lingering questions about the consequences of their planned meeting, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
