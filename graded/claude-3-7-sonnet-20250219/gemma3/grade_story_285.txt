<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tiber's hesitancy and awkwardness are consistently portrayed through his internal conflict and reluctance to speak against the Collective. His transformation from passive observer to subtle activist feels authentic. However, his characterization as a "swordsman" feels underdeveloped—this aspect appears only in the first and last lines without meaningful integration into his identity or actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc from Tiber's passive regret to his decision to act as a bridge between worlds. The hermit crabs provide an elegant catalyst for his realization. However, the plot relies heavily on internal realization rather than external action, and the resolution—sending a postcard—feels somewhat anticlimactic given the established stakes of preserving an entire cultural tradition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents creates a vivid, contradictory landscape that perfectly mirrors the story's themes of opposing forces seeking balance. The setting functions as both literal and metaphorical ground for the conflict between tradition and progress. Sensory details of steam against winter create a palpable atmosphere that enhances the emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hermit crabs serve as an effective central metaphor for gradual, collaborative change. The story skillfully explores themes of cultural preservation, technological progress, and finding middle ground. However, the narrative relies heavily on telling rather than showing Tiber's emotional journey, and the stakes remain somewhat abstract without concrete examples of what's being lost with the Sky-Singers' traditions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids obvious AI patterns and creates a unique world with specific details. The hermit crab metaphor is fresh and thoughtfully developed. However, some phrasing feels overly formal ("ephemeral rancor," "a facilitator of exchange"), and the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern of realization-to-action without surprising turns or complications.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The contrast between technological progress and traditional wisdom is thoughtfully explored through Tiber's internal conflict. While the prose occasionally becomes too abstract or explanatory, the core metaphor of gradual, adaptive change provides a memorable framework that elevates the piece beyond its constraints.</comment>
