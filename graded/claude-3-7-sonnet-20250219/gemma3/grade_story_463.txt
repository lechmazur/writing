<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber is effectively portrayed as a dry-witted sentinel with clear motivation to contain broken promises. His character is revealed through his interactions with the rope and Elara, showing his rigid personality and obsession with order. His voice is distinct in dialogue, though his emotional depth could be further developed beyond his primary motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent, with the confiscation of the rope driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, beginning with Tiber crossing off the final name and ending with him containing another broken promise. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action, with logical cause-and-effect relationships throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting brilliantly complements the theme of eroding promises and forgotten oaths. Sensory details like "smelling of salt and regret" and the "circular space" create an immersive atmosphere that enhances the supernatural elements. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical representation of Tiber's isolation and obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional and intellectual impact through its exploration of grief, obligation, and futility. Rich symbolism (the rope as binding, the lighthouse as isolation) creates layers of meaning. The central conflict between preserving/containing the past versus accepting change is effectively established. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting the cyclical, perhaps futile nature of Tiber's mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its magical realism approach to broken promises as physical artifacts with lingering energy. The prose avoids clich√©s and generic descriptions, instead offering specific, evocative imagery. Character emotions are shown through actions rather than stated directly. The consistent tone and unique premise suggest authentic authorial voice rather than formulaic writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity serves the story well, creating a haunting snapshot of Tiber's lonely existence. The lingering questions about the nature of his collection and whether his efforts are futile provide depth beyond the explicit narrative. The prose balances clarity with evocative language.</comment>
