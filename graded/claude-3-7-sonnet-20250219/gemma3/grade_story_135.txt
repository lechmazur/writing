<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his peculiar motivation and methods. His ambition as a brewer connects naturally to his quest, with the frost-petal alloy showing integration of his craft. His fierce loyalty to preserving lost languages manifests consistently in his actions. However, we lack deeper insight into his personal history or emotional complexity beyond his singular obsession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Tiber's initial belief through frustration to discovery and partial resolution. The deciphering of bruises drives the narrative forward logically, and the submersible expedition provides satisfying progression. The ending acknowledges both accomplishment and ongoing quest, creating closure while suggesting continuation. The cause-effect relationships are consistently maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor setting brilliantly complements the theme of preservation, with ice literally suspending the past. The mechanical caravans create an intriguing steampunk-adjacent atmosphere that enhances the story's uniqueness. The perpetual twilight, groaning ice, and black water create a sensory-rich environment that reinforces the mood of mystery and discovery. The submerged grotto payoff is particularly effective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of "bruises on the world" to represent linguistic loss, creating resonant subtext about cultural preservation. The narrative shows rather than tells Tiber's dedication through his actions. The emotional impact is strong in the final discovery scene, and the theme of preserving what others consider worthless is developed with subtlety. The story prompts reflection on language extinction and cultural memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of "bruises" left by lost words and the unusual method of using a straw as a divining rod. The prose avoids being overly ornate while maintaining distinctiveness. However, the "eccentric old man with a mission" character archetype is somewhat familiar, and the narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the harbor folk's perception of Tiber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a folktale quality appropriate to the theme of linguistic preservation. The lingering impression of Tiber's unfinished work effectively mirrors the story's theme of preservation against inevitable loss. While some elements could be more deeply explored, the overall execution demonstrates creative vision and thoughtful crafting.</comment>
