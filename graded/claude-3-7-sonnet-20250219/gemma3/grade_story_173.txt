<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's character is well-established through his preference for "root and bloom" over people and his motivation to preserve connections rather than profit. His orchardist background cleverly connects to his multiverse-tending abilities. However, his emotional journey lacks sufficient depth and development within the narrative. While we understand what drives him, we don't fully experience his internal struggle or growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the reclamation action to drive the narrative forward with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from problem identification to resolution. The connection between the beginning (Tiber contemplating at a kitchen table) and end (completing his task at another table) creates pleasing symmetry. However, the stakes could be more clearly established to heighten tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater city hall setting is vividly rendered with striking imagery ("looming like a skeletal whale") and effectively supports the multiverse concept. The atmosphere of expectant water, suspended documents, and vacant-eyed portraits creates an eerily beautiful liminal space. The sensory details are particularly strong, especially the tactile elements of the phantom hand and the final "scent of brine and rustling of dried leaves."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the kitchen table as both literal object and metaphorical anchor, creating resonant symbolism between ordinary objects and cosmic significance. The theme of connection across realities is well-developed. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by distance from Tiber's inner experience, and the conflict resolution feels slightly too neat given the cosmic scale of the problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of interdimensional trade routes and the orchardist-as-multiverse-tender metaphor. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and specific imagery. However, some phrasing ("bittersweet grit settling in his soul") verges on purple prose, and the emotional landscape could be more nuanced rather than stated directly. The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing Tiber's feelings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The multiverse concept is handled with restraint, avoiding common sci-fi tropes. The brevity works well for this glimpse into a larger cosmos. What prevents a higher score is the somewhat distant narrative perspective that limits emotional investment and the occasional reliance on abstract description rather than concrete detail.</comment>
