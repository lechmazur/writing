<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber is exceptionally well-realized through his empathic blacksmith identity. His motivation to preserve humanity's emotional essence is clear and consistent. His approach to the spectral child—offering connection rather than banishment—perfectly aligns with his established traits. The character possesses gravitas and purpose that transcends the brief word count, though some additional personal history might have further enriched his portrayal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from the disturbance in the dollhouse to Tiber's intervention and resolution. The action of mollifying the spectral child drives the narrative forward with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with the resolution feeling earned rather than rushed. The connection between the beginning (Tiber's isolation) and end (his continued purpose) creates satisfying narrative symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum creates an exquisite atmosphere that perfectly complements the themes of preserved memory and forgotten humanity. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical landscape. Sensory details—rainbow shards of light, dust-laden windows, the beating forge—create a vivid, immersive world that enhances the emotional resonance of Tiber's actions. The post-human timeframe adds poignant depth to the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional impact through its exploration of memory, connection, and preservation. The central metaphor of heartbeats as human continuity resonates powerfully. The writing employs evocative imagery and symbolism (the hummingbird as fragile hope, the forge as persistent creation) that elevates the narrative. The story effectively "shows" emotional states through action and atmosphere rather than telling. The ending leaves readers with a lingering sense of bittersweet purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, avoiding predictable ghost story tropes. The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate ("a practiced spontaneity, honed over decades"), but generally maintains purposeful clarity. The emotional resonance feels genuine rather than manufactured. The metaphors (particularly the blacksmith as soul-healer) are fresh and specific to this narrative. The story avoids formulaic patterns in its exploration of connection beyond memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, making them feel essential rather than imposed. The brevity serves the narrative, creating a focused meditation on memory and connection. The writing demonstrates creative thinking in how it combines elements (particularly the blacksmith's craft with emotional healing). The story leaves readers with lingering questions about what constitutes humanity when memory fades, suggesting depth beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
