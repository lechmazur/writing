<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber is well-developed through his unique ability to "hear" objects' stories. His motivation to preserve forgotten narratives is consistent and compelling. The matchmaker background cleverly parallels his current mission of connecting lost stories, though this connection could be more explicitly developed. His emotional response to the button reveals depth, but his personal stakes could be heightened.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Tiber's discovery of the button to his realization about his own role as a frequency. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the beginning (seeking a secret) connecting meaningfully to the end (becoming the solution himself). The pacing effectively balances exposition and revelation, though the transition from technological mystery to metaphysical truth could be slightly smoother.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating library zeppelin creates an immediately distinctive atmosphere that perfectly complements the ethereal nature of the narrative. The interstitial spaces "between channels" brilliantly reinforces the theme of lost connections. Sensory details like "the quiet hum of static" and the kaleidoscope of visions effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space. The setting and timeframe work in perfect harmony with the concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of connection, memory, and loss. The central metaphor of frequency as both technological concept and emotional conduit is masterfully handled. The ending delivers a profound philosophical statement about the persistence of stories that resonates beyond the narrative. The conflict between technological and emotional solutions is elegantly resolved, though the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, particularly in the fusion of technological and emotional elements. The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate ("a sharp gentleness in his gaze"), and some metaphors feel familiar. While the narrative avoids major AI-writing pitfalls, there are moments where emotional states are stated rather than demonstrated through action. The consistent tone and unique premise elevate it above formulaic writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, allowing for a complete emotional arc. The philosophical depth achieved within the word count is impressive, leaving the reader with lingering questions about connection and memory. A few passages could be tightened for greater impact, but overall, the story demonstrates remarkable craft and vision.</comment>
