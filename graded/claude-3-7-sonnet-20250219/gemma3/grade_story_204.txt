<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tiber's profession as a professional cuddler effectively informs his prejudice against "Skyfarers" and creates meaningful character tension. His motivation to overcome prejudice is clear, though his transformation feels somewhat rushed. The chance encounter reveals his inner conflict well, but his voice lacks distinctive qualities in the limited dialogue present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from flight from ceremony to transformative encounter to return with new perspective. The chance encounter effectively drives the narrative forward, though the resolution feels slightly too neat given the deep-seated nature of the prejudice. The connection between beginning and end is clear, but the emotional transformation occurs with insufficient struggle to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the formal gala with the farmer's market creates effective tension, while the abandoned spaceport hangar serves as a powerful metaphor for Tiber's prejudice. The atmosphere skillfully balances melancholy with hope. Sensory details like the "scent of rusting metal" and Elara's voice "like wind chimes" create immersive, evocative imagery that enhances the thematic elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of connection, prejudice, and understanding through meaningful symbolism (the ticket punch as blessing rather than validation). The central conflict of Tiber's prejudice is well-established, though its resolution feels somewhat accelerated. The peach as symbol works well, and the final realization about human connection across vast distances provides satisfying thematic closure, though it verges on being too explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, certain phrases like "eyes holding the weight of forgotten constellations" feel unnecessarily ornate. The narrative occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states. The core metaphor of the ticket punch is original, but the transformation arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern of prejudice-encounter-enlightenment without sufficient nuance or resistance to change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The brevity works well for the single transformative encounter, though it constrains the depth of character development. The central metaphor of the ticket punch effectively carries the thematic weight, but the resolution feels slightly too tidy for a story dealing with deep-seated prejudice.</comment>
