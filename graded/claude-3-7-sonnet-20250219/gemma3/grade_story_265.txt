<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Deputy Harding's impassive nature is consistently portrayed and meaningfully connected to his quest for transcendence. His detachment becomes a strength rather than a limitation, allowing him to observe without judgment. His motivation to witness grace is clear and drives his actions. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into how this impassivity developed or affects his life beyond the cathedral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the mundane (oil change) with the transcendent (witnessing grace). The stretching action naturally initiates communication with bees, creating a logical progression toward the supernatural encounter. The narrative achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from routine to revelation to reflection, with the peach serving as a perfect resolution symbol. The pacing effectively balances mechanical details with mystical elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of mechanical work within a cathedral-turned-orchard creates a stunning visual and thematic contrast. Sensory details are exceptional—metallic scrapes echoing in vast space, sunlight fracturing through stained glass, the shifting tones of bee buzzing. The setting perfectly embodies the story's central tension between the ordinary and transcendent, with the atmosphere shifting subtly as the supernatural encounter unfolds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—the cathedral as container of memory, the twist tie humming with energy, the peach as divine offering. The narrative effectively "shows" Harding's experience through sensory details rather than exposition. The theme of finding transcendence in ordinary moments emerges organically. The ending leaves readers with a lingering sense of mystery and possibility that elevates the entire piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, demonstrating consistent tone and thoughtful integration of elements. The language is precise without being overwrought, and metaphors feel fresh. Particularly strong is the nuanced handling of Harding's emotional state through physical sensations rather than stated feelings. Some phrases like "a cautious bravery settling in his chest" verge on telling rather than showing, but these moments are rare in an otherwise authentic narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, contributing to the central theme of finding transcendence in ordinary moments. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated moment of revelation that mirrors the protagonist's experience. The lingering image of the glowing peach demonstrates how effectively the story creates resonance beyond its limited word count.</comment>
