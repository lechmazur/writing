<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "joyfully melancholic" nature is well-established and consistently influences their perspective throughout. Their motivation to step out of family shadows feels authentic, and their gift for "hearing the drowned" creates a distinctive voice. The character's transformation from passive observer to active healer shows meaningful development, though some aspects of their personality could be more deeply explored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from the character's decision to visit the carnival, through the discovery of the amber, to the resolution of both the ghost's story and the protagonist's personal journey. The narrative achieves a complete arc within the tight constraints, with the "arousal of the soul" effectively driving the character's transformation. Cause-and-effect relationships are clear, and the pacing balances exposition and action well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("peeling paint," "shattered glass," "ghostly scent of cotton candy") that create a haunting atmosphere perfectly suited to the story's themes. The setting meaningfully contrasts with the protagonist's usual underwater domain while serving as an effective bridge between the living and dead worlds. The carnival's decay beautifully complements the "thawing heart" concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the amber as both literal object and powerful metaphor for preserved memory and emotion. The narrative skillfully balances showing and telling, particularly in conveying the protagonist's emotional transformation. The theme of finding joy within sorrow is subtly developed throughout, culminating in the poignant final line. The story evokes genuine emotional resonance through its exploration of memory, legacy, and purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of elements, particularly in how it handles the "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" character and the amber metaphor. The prose occasionally relies on somewhat expected phrasings ("clear as a bell," "washed over me"), but generally avoids clich√©s. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than formulaic, though some metaphors could be fresher. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and demonstrates a distinctive style.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity serves the story well, creating an intimate glimpse into a transformative moment. The narrative demonstrates creative thinking in how it connects the protagonist's gift, family legacy, and the found object. The final reflections leave the reader with lingering questions about memory, grief, and joy that extend beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
