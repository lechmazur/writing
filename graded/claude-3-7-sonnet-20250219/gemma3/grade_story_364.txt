<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's character is exceptionally well-developed through his unique communication method and obsession with vanishing trades. His inability to speak yet profound ability to communicate complex ideas through botanical sketches and pottery arrangements reveals his deep connection to temporal anomalies. His motivation is clear and consistent throughout, and his methods align perfectly with his established traits. Dr. Aris serves as an effective foil, skeptical yet respectful of Tiber's unconventional wisdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure flows organically from Tiber's attempt to advise Aris about finding the glassblower, through the interpretation of the pottery shards, to the discovery of the location and Aris's decision to investigate. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The pacing effectively builds tension through the decoding process to the revelation and final decision, creating a complete narrative journey despite the brevity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temporal anomaly study setting is richly realized through specific details like "reinforced windows" and the "chipped Formica table," creating a vivid contrast between institutional sterility and the organic nature of Tiber's work. The backdrop of a "silent revolution" adds atmospheric tension without overwhelming the intimate focus. The world-building seamlessly integrates the concept of time bleeding into itself, with Prague serving as a perfect liminal space for the narrative's conclusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its exploration of preservation versus loss, the value of craftsmanship, and the nature of time itself. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought, employing effective imagery like time "bleeding into itself" and the "mundane miracle" of preserved skills. The ending delivers emotional resonance through its quiet optimism about preserving what seems destined to be lost. The narrative successfully "shows" Tiber's methods and Aris's growing understanding rather than explaining them directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, with fresh metaphors and consistent characterization throughout. The concept of communicating through botanical sketches and pottery fragments feels genuinely innovative. However, occasional phrases like "quiet persistence" and "inevitable entropy" verge on familiar territory, and some emotional transitions could be more nuanced. The story maintains a consistent tone and demonstrates a distinctive style, particularly in its handling of the relationship between Tiber and Aris.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, making each feel essential rather than forced. The brevity serves the narrative well, creating an appropriately fragmentary glimpse into a world where time itself is unstable. The prose balances clarity with evocative imagery, and the ending leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of time, preservation, and human connection that transcend the immediate narrative.</comment>
