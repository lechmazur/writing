<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his vigilance, punctuality, and grief-driven motivation. His orchardist background cleverly contrasts with the sterile facility setting. The peacock pattern obsession effectively reveals his methodical mind. However, his emotional journey feels somewhat underdevelopedâ€”we're told more than shown his grief transformation, and his dialogue is limited, preventing a fully realized voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conspiracy plot unfolds logically from Tiber's discovery of the seal to his methodical investigation. The peacock pattern method drives the narrative forward with increasing tension as Thorne becomes flustered. However, the resolution feels rushed in the final paragraphs, with too many implications introduced without sufficient development. The story achieves a complete arc but lacks space to fully explore the conspiracy's scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sterile paper airplane facility creates an excellent contrast with both Tiber's orchardist background and the organic peacock patterns. The clinical environment amplifies the hidden conspiracy atmosphere while providing a logical setting for the methodical investigation. The juxtaposition of mechanical precision against natural patterns creates a compelling thematic tension that enhances the conspiratorial tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock tail as both literal tool and metaphor for hidden truths and watchful eyes. The narrative builds genuine intrigue through the griffin seal mystery and creates emotional resonance in Tiber's quest to understand his wife's death. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing Tiber's emotional journey, and some key revelations feel rushed rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers like repetitive phrasing or abrupt topic shifts, it suffers from exposition-heavy paragraphs that tell rather than show character development. The conspiracy plot follows somewhat predictable patterns without truly surprising twists. The peacock pattern concept is original, but its explanation feels overly technical rather than organically integrated. The prose occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate, particularly in describing Tiber's emotional state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional stakes. The peacock pattern method cleverly ties to both the paper airplane setting and conspiracy theme. However, the brevity constrains full development of the conspiracy's scope and Tiber's emotional journey. While the story creates intrigue and a satisfying investigative arc, it would benefit from more space to develop its ambitious themes and complex emotional underpinnings.</comment>
