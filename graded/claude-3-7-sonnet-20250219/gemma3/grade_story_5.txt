<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his silence, methodical approach, and transformation from seeking "spectacular revelations" to appreciating "the beauty of the ordinary." His guarded nature evolves naturally through the narrative. His motivation to preserve wisdom feels authentic, though his backstory could be more developed to strengthen his characterization further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Tiber's solitary work to his revelation about the true nature of wisdom preservation. The story achieves a satisfying resolution when Tiber finds peace in his quiet work. However, the middle section feels slightly rushed, with Elara's nightmare sequence and Tiber's epiphany happening in quick succession without fully exploring the tension or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The forgotten power plant setting brilliantly mirrors Tiber's workâ€”both repurposed for "a quieter, more vital task." Sensory details like "dust motes danced in shafts of light" and the plant's "ambient groan" create a richly atmospheric world. The juxtaposition of industrial decay with delicate healing work creates a compelling atmosphere that enhances the story's themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of preservation, humility, and finding meaning in quiet dedication rather than grand gestures. The metaphor of the power plant is particularly strong. The narrative shows rather than tells Tiber's emotional journey, culminating in a satisfying resolution that feels earned. The subtext about valuing "the quiet dedication of those who remembered" resonates beyond the immediate story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, certain phrases like "pensive mirth" and "theoretically whimsical" feel somewhat forced. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate ("the pensive mirth he found in their silent stories"). However, the narrative maintains consistent tone and the power plant metaphor shows genuine creative insight. The character motivations feel authentically human rather than algorithmically determined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a clear thematic through-line. The narrative balances exposition and action effectively within its constraints. The ending provides both resolution and lingering questions about the nature of wisdom and preservation. While occasionally veering into purple prose, the writing generally serves the story's meditative tone and philosophical underpinnings.</comment>
