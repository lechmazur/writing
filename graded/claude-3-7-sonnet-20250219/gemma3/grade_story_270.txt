<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's character is well-developed through his cynicism and arrogance tempered with humility. His motivation to preserve fading memories is clear and consistent. The transformation from detached collector to empathetic vessel shows meaningful character growth. However, his "voice" could be more distinctive, and the revelation of empathy feels slightly rushed rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the awakening action to drive the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from preparation to ritual to revelation to transformation. The cause-effect relationships are logical, and the pacing manages the build-up and climax well. The connection between the canyon echo method and the final outcome could be more explicitly developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten lighthouse library creates a perfect atmospheric vessel for this ghostly tale. The setting's isolation mirrors the character's and the lost souls' condition brilliantly. Sensory details—dust motes in light, the hum of crystals, the scent of salt and sorrow—create immersive atmosphere. The timeframe of "a borrowed century" enhances the ethereal quality and reinforces the theme of ephemeral existence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively evokes melancholy and wonder through strong imagery and metaphor. The theme of memory preservation and unexpected connection resonates emotionally. The ending feels purposeful, with Tiber's realization creating meaningful closure. The subtext about isolation, remembrance, and the arrogance of attempting to control the ephemeral adds depth. The story shows rather than tells, particularly in the ritual sequence and Tiber's emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates originality in its metaphors and descriptions, avoiding clichéd ghost story elements. However, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("the hush of a borrowed century," "a cynical conjurer momentarily humbled"). The emotional arc is genuine but could benefit from more nuanced development. The story avoids predictable patterns in its exploration of a spectral collector becoming the collected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused glimpse into a larger supernatural world. The lingering question of whether Tiber is now trapped or finally fulfilled provides meaningful depth. While some transitions between elements could be smoother, the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking and purposeful craft.</comment>
