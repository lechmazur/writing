<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tiber's character development is strong, with clear progression from a humble miracle-maker to someone consumed by ambition. His transformation from easing suffering to feeding on it reveals psychological depth. His motivation to become "the miracle" drives his actions consistently. The dialogue with Hemlock crystallizes his character effectively. Only lacking more nuanced internal conflict that would elevate this to excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Tiber's modest beginnings to his corrupted ambition, with effective escalation through increasingly disturbing miracles. The cause-effect relationship between harvesting stories and creating miracles is well-established. The ending provides appropriate closure while maintaining tension. However, the middle section could benefit from a more defined inciting incident to sharpen the narrative pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building within the constraints. Whisperwood feels alive and responsive to Tiber's actions. The forest that "seems to lean in" creates a sentient atmosphere that enhances the supernatural elements. The sensory details of the hammer's song and its evolution from melody to dirge effectively convey the shifting tone. The setting and concept of manufactured miracles intertwine seamlessly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of power, ambition, and corruption through strong imagery and symbolism. The hammer's song as a metaphor for Tiber's evolving power is particularly effective. The narrative shows rather than tells, especially in depicting the villagers' changing attitudes. The central conflict between healing and exploitation emerges organically. The final image of the resonant note "lost in the hush of memory" provides haunting closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates consistent style with fresh, specific metaphors and avoids purple prose while maintaining literary quality. The progression of Tiber's character feels organic rather than algorithmic. The story subverts the typical benevolent soothsayer trope effectively. Some phrases like "dreadful hope" and the hammer's song show particular originality. Only occasionally does the language become slightly ornate, but this aligns with the mystical subject matter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a fable-like quality appropriate to the content. The lingering question of what happens after Tiber's transformation provides depth beyond the explicit narrative. A truly distinctive piece that balances literary craft with engaging storytelling.</comment>
