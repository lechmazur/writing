<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is effectively shaped by his loss and longing. His motivation to reconnect with Mira drives his actions coherently. The sea glass serves as both emotional tether and practical tool. However, his character lacks some depth beyond his grief-driven purpose, and while his "voice" emerges in his rituals and determination, it could be more distinctive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot's structure works well within the word constraint, with the action of "recommencing" effectively driving the narrative forward. The microfilm decoding method creates tension and revelation. While the beginning and end connect well through Elias's emotional journey, some middle transitions feel rushed, particularly the revelation about Mira's transformation, which would benefit from more development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating observatory suspended between sea and stars creates a compelling liminal space that perfectly complements the story's themes of existence between worlds. Sensory details like "creaking like old bones" and "air thick with salt and static" create an immersive atmosphere that enhances the otherworldly tone. The setting powerfully reinforces both the literal and metaphysical isolation of the character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ethereal wisps as both literal entities and metaphors for memory and connection. The central theme of finding meaning in loss resonates emotionally. Imagery and symbolism (particularly the sea glass as conduit) work well. However, the resolution comes too easily and would benefit from more complexity in how Elias processes his discovery about Mira's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of trapping ethereal wisps and using sea glass as a connection to the lost. However, some phrases like "loss had hollowed him out" and "the world held its breath" feel like literary clich√©s. The emotional trajectory follows a somewhat predictable arc of grief to hope. The writing occasionally slips into overwrought language ("dawn's gritty, whimsical embrace") that diminishes authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinct atmosphere. The floating observatory setting and the concept of trapping ethereal wisps create a memorable framework. While the emotional core is strong, the resolution feels slightly rushed and too neat given the complexity of the premise. The lingering impression is effective but could have been more profound with a more nuanced ending.</comment>
