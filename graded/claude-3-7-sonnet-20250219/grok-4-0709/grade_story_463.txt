<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit is effectively demonstrated through his quips and approach to dangerous situations. His motivation to learn spirit-binding is clear, though his emotional connection to Mira could be more developed. His calculated use of tango as a method aligns with his character, but his personality could be more consistently shown throughout rather than merely stated. His distinct voice emerges primarily in his single line of dialogue, which effectively captures his dry humor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively moves from Elias completing his list to freeing Mira through the confiscation of her locket. The tango method serves the plot well by establishing a connection that enables the climactic action. Despite the brevity, the story achieves a complete arc with clear causality and resolution. The concept of eroding promises shapes the narrative foundation well, though the pacing feels slightly rushed toward the resolution, not allowing the emotional impact of Mira's freedom to fully resonate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom is vividly established with "salt-crusted walls" and "spectral whispers." The setting naturally enhances both the supernatural elements and the isolation of Elias's vigil. The atmosphere skillfully balances eerie hauntedness with intimate connection. Sensory details like the "creaking bedroom," "beam slicing through fog," and the lighthouse's beam create immersive environmental texture that supports the ghostly premise and reinforces the loneliness and dedication of the sentinel's position.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses imagery of erosion (promises eroding "like waves gnawing at stone") to mirror the physical setting and thematic concerns. The tango serves as both literal method and metaphor for the delicate negotiation between living and dead. The ending achieves poignancy through Mira's "grateful smile" and the lingering echo of music. However, the emotional stakes could be higher—we understand the mechanics of their connection more than we feel its significance, leaving the resolution intellectually satisfying but not deeply moving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in using tango as a bridge between worlds and binding ghostly presence to physical objects. The prose avoids generic descriptors with specific details like "dry-witted sentinel" and "sultry melody." However, certain phrases like "reckless precision" appear repetitively, suggesting formulaic writing. The lighthouse setting narrowly avoids cliché through specific details of the keeper's life. While the emotional progression follows logic, it sometimes tells rather than shows Elias's feelings, particularly in the final moments of the ghost's release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive supernatural tale. The lighthouse setting, tango method, and spirit-binding concept work harmoniously rather than feeling forced together. The brevity serves the ghost story well, creating a concentrated atmosphere and focused narrative. The ending achieves resolution while suggesting deeper implications about promises, obligation, and release. While highly competent, the story doesn't quite achieve the exceptional emotional resonance or linguistic brilliance required for prestigious publication, but it demonstrates skilled craftsmanship throughout.</comment>
