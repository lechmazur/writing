<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character of Elias has a clear motivation and defined traits that drive his actions. His dual identity as wreck-diver/ghost whisperer creates interesting tension, and his desire to break from family tradition while simultaneously honoring it shows complexity. However, his emotional journey feels somewhat rushed within the constraints, and his "voice" lacks distinctive qualities that would make him truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elias's contemplation to spiritual awakening, with the amber providing a meaningful catalyst. The structure effectively balances past and present through the framing device of the letter. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and some causal relationships (particularly how the ghost materialized the amber) lack sufficient development to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creates a hauntingly effective backdrop that resonates symbolically with Elias's emotional journey. The contrast between past vibrancy and present decay amplifies the story's themes. Strong sensory details establish atmosphere, particularly in passages about "rusty laughter" and "spectral pleas." The setting meaningfully enhances both the ghostly encounters and Elias's internal conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism, particularly the insect trapped in amber mirroring Elias's own entrapment in tradition. The emotional journey feels authentic, and the conflict between honoring tradition and finding one's voice resonates. However, some metaphors ("thawing heart") feel slightly overworked, and the resolution could benefit from more nuance rather than the somewhat neat epiphany presented.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose shows creativity in its metaphors and imagery, but occasionally relies on overly ornate language that borders on purple prose. While the concept is original, some emotional descriptions feel stated rather than demonstrated, particularly in the final paragraphs. The narrative occasionally suffers from overly precise descriptors that read as writerly rather than authentic character perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The writing demonstrates ambition and creates a distinctive atmosphere. However, some overworked phrases and slightly rushed character development prevent it from reaching its full potential. The ending raises interesting questions about permanence of change but would benefit from more subtlety in execution.</comment>
