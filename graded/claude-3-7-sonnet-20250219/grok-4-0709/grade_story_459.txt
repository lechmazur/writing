<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly developed through his awkward physical presence and emotional burden. His motivation to release Lila's ghost is clear and emotionally resonant, tied effectively to his guilt over her death. The attribute "elegantly clumsy" manifests both physically and metaphorically in his grief work. However, his "ghost-seeing" ability feels underdeveloped—we're told he "had always seen them" but this significant trait isn't explored deeply enough, leaving questions about this foundational aspect of his character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses naturally from Elias's routine to his ghost-tracking to the climactic confrontation with Lila. The assigned elements are skillfully woven into a coherent narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. The story demonstrates effective cause-and-effect relationships between Elias's guilt, his methodical tracking of Lila, and their final cathartic moment. The resolution—Lila crumbling into dust as Elias finds liberation—provides a satisfying emotional arc that feels earned rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, symbolically rich setting that perfectly complements the theme of impermanence and preservation. The juxtaposition of the scientific preservation of something typically ephemeral (sand castles) alongside Elias's struggle with letting go creates thematic resonance. Silence is effectively rendered as a tangible force throughout the narrative. The atmosphere balances the surreal with the mundane, creating a liminal space where the supernatural encounter feels natural rather than forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional impact through its layered symbolism—sand castles as preserved memories, the crumbling flower crown signifying release. The narrative demonstrates sophisticated "showing" through physical details like Elias's heart pounding and Lila's crown crackling. The central conflict (Elias's guilt) and theme (finding freedom through acceptance) are masterfully integrated. The ending offers catharsis while maintaining subtlety. The writing avoids explaining emotions directly, instead relying on sensory details and metaphor to convey Elias's journey from guilt to liberation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story shows creativity in its concept and execution, particularly in its metaphorical linking of preserving sand castles with holding onto grief. However, certain phrases like "the dissonance of silence" and "dissecting" emotions feel slightly overused and formulaic. The writing occasionally veers toward purple prose ("the way the absence of sound screamed unspoken regrets"). While the core narrative feels original, some descriptions of the supernatural elements rely on familiar ghost story conventions. The sensory details, though present, sometimes default to expected imagery rather than surprising observations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The unusual elements (sand castle preservation, elevator repair, ghost-seeing) feel necessary rather than arbitrary. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a dreamlike quality that enhances the supernatural elements. The emotional journey feels authentic despite the fantastical setting. While there are occasional moments where the language becomes slightly overwrought, the overall effect is a haunting, emotionally resonant piece that lingers after reading.</comment>
