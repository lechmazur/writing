<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-established through his motivation and actions. His transformation from respected healer to rogue scientist creates internal tension. His yearning for Lira adds emotional depth. However, his character could benefit from more personal history or conflicted feelings about his methods to achieve fuller dimensionality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Elias's motivation to his actions with the butterflies and morse code signals. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with the outcome of his plan left somewhat ambiguous, preventing a truly complete sense of closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is richly realized with sensory details of brass lanterns, whirring gears, and creaking pressure. The political timeframe of "between broken treaties" elegantly contextualizes the conflict. The underwater world with bio-engineered butterflies creates a distinctive atmosphere that perfectly balances beauty and peril.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly with the butterflies representing both fragility and hope. The juxtaposition of beauty against war creates compelling tension. While the emotional stakes are clear, the ending leaves the impact of Elias's actions somewhat unresolved, preventing the story from achieving its full potential impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While imaginative in concept, the prose occasionally lapses into ornate language that feels self-conscious rather than natural ("like weary hearts," "unjustly fair in their luminous beauty"). Some phrases are unnecessarily complex, and the emotional description occasionally tells rather than shows. The submarine world is fresh, but the love-conquers-war theme follows familiar patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully weaves together diverse elements into a coherent narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The steampunk submarine world and bio-engineered butterflies create a distinctive setting. However, some overwrought language and the somewhat open-ended conclusion prevent it from achieving its full potential. Still, it leaves readers with compelling questions about love's power to overcome conflict.</comment>
