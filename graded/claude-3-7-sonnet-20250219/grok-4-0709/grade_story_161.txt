<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's vigilance is effectively linked to his past as an orchardist and his tragedy, creating a strong foundation for his character. His motivation to overcome grief through exposing the conspiracy feels genuine, though his sardonic tone sometimes feels imposed rather than organically emerging from his characterization. His transition from grief-stricken orchardist to conspiracy-unraveler could benefit from more psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from setup to revelation, with the conspiracy unraveling logically through Elias's observations. The paper airplane facility provides an inventive backdrop for corporate espionage, and the peacock pattern creates a coherent visual motif. However, the conspiracy's mechanics feel slightly underdeveloped, with the final confrontation resolved too neatly for the complexity established earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility is vividly established as both innocent facade and sinister operation. The contrast between Elias's agricultural background and the sterile, technical environment creates effective tension. Sensory details like "dimly lit corridors" and "fluorescent lights" establish atmosphere, though more consistent sensory engagement throughout would strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story employs effective symbolism with the peacock motif representing both deception and vigilance. The irony of children's playthings being used for espionage creates thematic depth. However, the story relies heavily on telling rather than showing in key emotional moments, and dialogue is minimal. The final confrontation feels rushed, reducing potential emotional impact despite the strong symbolic framework established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of paper airplanes as covert messengers is original, the execution occasionally relies on predictable conspiracy tropes. The language sometimes becomes unnecessarily ornate ("sardonic glee twisting his lips into a wry smile"), creating distance rather than authenticity. The character's emotional journey lacks nuance, often explicitly stated rather than revealed through subtle actions or reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a coherent narrative with thematic depth. The peacock imagery provides a clever visual motif that ties together the conspiracy and Elias's vigilance. However, the prose occasionally prioritizes flowery description over clarity, and the ending feels somewhat rushed and pat given the complex setup. Despite these issues, the story presents a thoughtful exploration of how tragedy can transform into purpose.</comment>
