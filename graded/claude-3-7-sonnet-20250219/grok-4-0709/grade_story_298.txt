<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Li Wei's characterization as a chameleon stage actor directly informs his methods and abilities. His "rationally impulsive" nature is demonstrated through his decision-making process, particularly in staging the reenactment. His motivation to "weave emotional honesty into illusions" drives the plot and is consistent throughout. What prevents a higher score is the limited exploration of his personal stakes or emotional development beyond serving his method.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the reproduction action as its central driver, creating a clear arc from mystery to revelation. The cold-case solving method is well-integrated, and the narrative maintains a logical flow from setup to resolution. The cause-effect relationship between the reenactment and discovery is convincing. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed, with the hidden writing solution appearing somewhat convenient rather than arising organically from the accumulated tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-oil Chinese palace setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details like "fractured golden beams on the dusty floor" and "vine-choked ruins." The juxtaposition of ancient architecture with solar technology creates a compelling atmosphere. The "sunlight through debris" concept is masterfully integrated as both atmosphere and plot device. The setting directly enables the plot's resolution when the light reveals the hidden writing, demonstrating exceptional integration of setting with narrative purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through its themes of truth emerging from illusion and finding hope in depletion. The central metaphor of stagecraft as a means to uncover truth is well-developed. The mystery's resolution offers satisfying narrative closure while supporting the broader theme. However, the storytelling occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some literary devices feel slightly overwrought rather than organic to the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the narrative shows creativity in its setting and premise, certain phrases feel unnecessarily ornate ("anxious serenity of a post-oil era"). The protagonist's reasoning sometimes lacks human nuance, appearing too methodical. The story avoids most common tropes but occasionally defaults to predictable patterns in the mystery's resolution. The writing shows distinctive stylistic choices but could benefit from more variation in sentence structure and fewer explicitly stated emotions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with clear purpose. The post-oil setting, chameleon actor, and cold-case method work together naturally rather than feeling forced. The limited word count is well-managed, delivering a complete arc. What prevents a higher score is the occasionally overwrought prose and the somewhat formulaic mystery resolution. Nevertheless, the story leaves the reader with compelling questions about truth, illusion, and how performance can reveal reality.</comment>
