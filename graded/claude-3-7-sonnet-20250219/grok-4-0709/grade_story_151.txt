<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's character is built effectively around his singular attribute of experiencing awe in an emotionless world. His motivation to restore emotion through cultivating the snowflake patterns creates meaningful tension. However, his inner conflict could be more deeply explored, and his emotional journey feels somewhat explained rather than shown through specific actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc despite constraints, with excellent cause-effect relationships between the discovery of the veil, the cultivation of the vine-like lattice, and the toppling of the idol. The snowflake method is logically integrated into the solution. The resolution feels somewhat rushed, with the idol's destruction and emotional restoration happening too quickly to fully land.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through the fusion of the lighthouse orchard, frozen light fruits, and ice floes. The juxtaposition of crystalline coldness against forbidden emotion creates powerful symbolic tension. Sensory details like "ice floes groaned beneath the cliffs" and the orbs "mimicking beacons against the ice" effectively build an immersive, original world that perfectly reinforces the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story employs rich symbolism throughout: the wedding veil representing abandoned emotion, snowflakes symbolizing ordered chaos, and the idol embodying fear-based control. The central conflict between emotional resurrection and rational stability creates genuine intellectual tension. The story shows rather than tells when depicting the astronomer's work, though emotional states are sometimes directly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story offers a highly original premise and inventive worldbuilding. The prose avoids predictable patterns with fresh metaphors like "fruits of frozen light" and "petrified the world into crystalline stasis." The conceptual fusion of rational design with organic growth feels genuinely innovative. Some phrases occasionally veer toward the overly ornate ("rationally mapping their organic expansions") but generally support the story's tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole, with the snowflake patterns, wedding veil, and lighthouse orchard all serving the central theme of emotional revival. The brevity works to create a fable-like quality that enhances impact. The philosophical questions about emotion versus logic create meaningful depth, though some sentence structures are overlong, occasionally disrupting flow.</comment>
