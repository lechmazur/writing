<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's character has clear motivation and his profession as a "social media exorcist" effectively informs his actions. His "indifferent enthusiasm" is consistently portrayed through his measured approach. However, the character lacks psychological depth - we understand what he does but get limited insight into who he truly is beyond his professional identity. His transformation feels somewhat predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from Elias's initial quest to his successful infiltration and personal transformation. The receipt as passkey creates a clever narrative device. However, the resolution feels rushed - his transformation from detachment to connection happens too easily, without sufficient obstacles or complications to create meaningful tension. The story's structural bones are strong but lack the narrative muscle of genuine conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric progression from abandoned music hall to mess hall to secret clubs creates an effective physical and metaphorical journey. Sensory details like "creaks and distant drips" and "graffiti and flickering neon remnants" establish a palpable mood. The contrast between digital emptiness and physical authenticity is well-rendered through the setting choices, creating an immersive world that actively supports the thematic concerns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The metaphorical connection between digital exorcism and personal demons shows thematic sophistication. The story effectively contrasts virtual relationships with authentic ones. However, the central conflict lacks sufficient stakes - Elias faces no real challenges in his journey, and his transformation feels somewhat unearned. The story shows rather than tells, but could benefit from more emotional nuance in how this transformation affects him beyond surface observations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept of "digital demons" feels fresh, but the execution occasionally slips into predictable territory. Phrases like "to reignite his own fading spark" and "exorcised his own virtual ghosts" verge on clich√©. The ending ritual with the burning receipt is somewhat formulaic. While the narrative maintains consistency, it lacks the distinctive stylistic fingerprint of truly original work. Some descriptions feel precisely generic rather than specifically evocative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates all assigned elements with reasonable cohesion. The conceit of a "social media exorcist" works as both character trait and metaphor. However, the lack of genuine obstacles prevents the story from achieving greater impact. While it raises interesting questions about authenticity in a digital age, the exploration remains somewhat surface-level without the complicating factors that would give it true literary weight.</comment>
