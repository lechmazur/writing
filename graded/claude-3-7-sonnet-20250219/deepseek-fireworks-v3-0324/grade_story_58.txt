<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scout's fierce loyalty is well-established and her internal conflict between dedication to "the cause" and emotional turbulence creates compelling tension. Her transformation from seeking peace to embracing chaos shows meaningful development. However, her specific motivations remain somewhat vague—we never learn what "the cause" actually is or why she's loyal to it, which limits deeper character understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively moves from the scout seeking meditation to embracing radicalization, with the power outage and moth imagery providing coherent symbolic parallels to her internal journey. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, though the transition from seeking calm to embracing chaos feels slightly rushed rather than fully earned through narrative development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a city blackout creates a distinctive, evocative setting that perfectly mirrors the protagonist's state of mind. The contrast between stillness above and chaos below, darkness and flickering light, creates rich atmospheric tension. Sensory details like the fluttering wings, rattling windows, and shifting shadows effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moths as a central metaphor—creatures drawn to light amid darkness—that parallels the scout's journey. The transformation of coded jokes from absurdity to revolutionary language creates meaningful subtext about radicalization. While the emotional arc is compelling, the story would benefit from more concrete stakes or specificity about the revolution being planned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and fresh imagery. The moth metaphor feels original rather than clichéd. However, some phrases like "her loyalty now a weapon, her dread a sacrament" veer toward purple prose, and the revolution theme remains somewhat generic without specific political or social context that would give it more authentic human nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about radicalization and inner transformation. The moth imagery and power outage setting effectively support the thematic exploration of chaos versus control. While the story creates a compelling atmosphere and character journey, it would benefit from more specific details about the cause/revolution to ground its abstract qualities in concrete stakes.</comment>
