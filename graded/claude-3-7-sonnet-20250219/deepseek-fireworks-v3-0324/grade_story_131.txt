<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The aloof orphan character is well-established through consistent behavior and internal monologue. Eli's detachment is shown through actions rather than merely stated, and the transformation from isolation to courage feels earned. However, the character lacks some depth—we understand Eli's present motivation but have minimal insight into formative experiences that shaped this aloofness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from discovery to action to resolution, with the loosening action serving as both literal and metaphorical pivot point. The cause-effect relationship between the stones, the anomaly, and Eli's intervention is clear. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and convenient—the anomaly yields too easily to Eli's intervention without sufficient explanation of why these particular actions work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a distinctive, immersive atmosphere that permeates every aspect of the story. Physical details like the humming air, groaning walls, and shimmering twilight effectively convey the warped reality. The garage setting works well as both literal and metaphorical space, contrasting the contained environment with the chaotic outside world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the stones as both literal objects and metaphorical anchors, creating layered meaning. The central theme of adaptation versus fear is well-developed through action rather than exposition. The ending provides satisfying emotional closure while maintaining subtlety. However, some metaphors ("a sky no longer at war with itself") feel slightly overwrought, and the transformation of the anomaly could benefit from more concrete sensory detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases ("their heart pounding not with fear, but with something fiercer") feel generic rather than specific to this character and situation. The gravitational anomaly concept, while interesting, follows somewhat predictable sci-fi patterns without truly innovative development. The emotional arc, while coherent, occasionally relies on telling rather than showing Eli's internal transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The gravitational anomaly serves as both literal setting and metaphor for emotional states, while the stones function effectively as plot devices and symbols. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a focused character study. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat given the cosmic scale of the anomaly introduced earlier.</comment>
