<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "morbid florist" character shows some depth through her relationship with decay and her evolution from seeking answers to acceptance. However, her "neutrally passionate" attribute feels contradictory rather than complex, and her motivations remain somewhat abstract. The character lacks specificity—we know her occupation and philosophical stance but little else that would make her distinctive or memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from seeking to understanding, with the character's journey providing structure. However, the action of "obliging" feels passive and underdeveloped as a plot driver. The resolution comes too easily and abstractly—a sudden epiphany without sufficient buildup or concrete stakes. The story prioritizes philosophical musings over narrative tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo creates a compelling liminal space that effectively supports the theme of cosmic understanding. The atmosphere of suspension between realms works well with the character's philosophical journey. The guttering lantern timeframe creates urgency, though some sensory details feel generic rather than specific to this unique setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts depth through its meditation on cycles of life and death, but relies too heavily on abstract statements rather than concrete imagery or action to convey its themes. The central conflict—the character's search for understanding—lacks urgency or specificity. While there are effective metaphors (candle as life, dojo as liminal space), the story tells more than it shows, particularly regarding the character's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The prose suffers from excessive abstraction and vague philosophical statements that sound profound but lack specificity. Phrases like "cosmic cycles," "neutrally passionate," and "boldly timid" read as contradictory rather than nuanced. The writing relies heavily on telling emotional states rather than showing them through concrete detail. The resolution follows a predictable epiphany pattern common in AI-generated philosophical narratives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all assigned elements, it prioritizes philosophical musings over narrative momentum. The abstract nature of both conflict and resolution creates distance rather than engagement. The prose occasionally achieves poetic resonance, particularly in descriptions of the setting, but the character's journey remains too abstract to create lasting impact. The story gestures toward depth without fully earning it.</comment>
