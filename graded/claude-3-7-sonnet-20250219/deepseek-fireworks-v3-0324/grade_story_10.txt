<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The duelist's transformation from chef to warrior to potential reconciler is compelling and well-motivated. His fatal flaws (pride, vengeance, inability to let go) drive his actions consistently. The revelation about his sister adds meaningful complexity, though his emotional shift at the end feels slightly rushed given the brevity of the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the beginning (seeking answers) to the end (finding forgiveness) with logical progression. The cookbook's revelation serves as an effective turning point. While the sister's hologram appearance feels slightly convenient, it efficiently advances the narrative within the tight constraints. The story achieves a complete arc with satisfying resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport customs office with humming server rooms creates a liminal space that perfectly mirrors the protagonist's state between vengeance and forgiveness. The contrast between technological decay and organic transformation (maggots to silver threads) reinforces the theme. Sensory details like the buzzing servers and flickering lights effectively establish atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully uses the cookbook as both literal object and metaphor for transformation. The parallel between recipes that can harm or heal creates meaningful subtext about choices and redemption. The ending achieves emotional resonance through the duelist's realization that "forgiveness was not an end, but a beginning." The story effectively shows rather than tells his emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of culinary arts with dueling and space technology. The maggots transforming into silver thread-spinning worms is a fresh metaphor for transformation. Some phrases like "elasticize his heart" feel slightly forced, and the sister's dialogue is somewhat expositional. However, the overall narrative maintains consistent tone and avoids predictable patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements (cooking, dueling, space technology, forgiveness) into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each element serving the central theme of transformation and reconciliation. The lingering image of the duelist smiling for the first time in years provides emotional resonance that extends beyond the narrative's conclusion.</comment>
