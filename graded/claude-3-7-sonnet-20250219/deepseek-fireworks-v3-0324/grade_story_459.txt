<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's character is well-developed through his relationship with ghosts and the flower crown. His motivation to find peace is clear, and his actions consistently reflect his struggle. The character possesses emotional depth, particularly in how he envies the scientists' focus while being haunted himself. However, we could benefit from more insight into his past beyond the brief mention of his sister's wedding to fully understand his attachment to the ghosts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves cohesively from Eli's haunting to his eventual release of the ghosts. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, with the flower crown serving as both catalyst and resolution. The connection between the sand castle preservation and Eli's own attempt to preserve memories creates thematic resonance. The pacing effectively builds to the emotional climax at the shore, though the scientist's sudden appearance and solution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a brilliant metaphorical setting that perfectly complements the theme of holding onto what's meant to fade. The juxtaposition of scientific preservation with supernatural haunting creates rich tension. Sensory details are particularly strong—the brittle petals, the humming machinery, the ocean meeting shore—all contributing to an atmosphere of fragile beauty and melancholy that enhances the emotional journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its extended metaphor of preservation versus release. The parallel between sand castles and memories creates meaningful subtext about the nature of grief. The ending feels earned and cathartic. The prose demonstrates restraint and precision, particularly in lines like "Liberation, he realized, wasn't in holding on or letting go, but in the elegantly clumsy act of trying." The story effectively shows rather than tells Eli's emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unusual setting and the metaphorical connection between ghost-seeing and sand castle preservation. The prose avoids clichés and purple language, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. Metaphors feel fresh and specific to the narrative. The emotional arc feels authentic rather than formulaic, particularly in how it handles grief and release. The only slight weakness is the somewhat predictable resolution of letting go at the ocean's edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than forced. The sand castle preservation lab and the flower crown work together to reinforce the central theme about the beauty and pain of holding onto what's meant to fade. The brevity feels like a strength rather than a limitation, with each sentence carrying meaningful weight. The ending leaves the reader with a lingering emotional resonance about the nature of memory and release.</comment>
