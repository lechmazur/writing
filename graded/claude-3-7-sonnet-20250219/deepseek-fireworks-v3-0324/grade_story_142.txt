<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lord Alistair's character is well-established through his aristocratic background juxtaposed with his current poverty. His motivation to recover family recipes is clear and consistent. The character's internal conflict about his family legacy is effectively portrayed, particularly in his final decision moment. However, his personality lacks some nuance and distinctive voice—his dialogue is minimal and his character development relies heavily on exposition rather than revealing actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the roller coaster ride as both literal and metaphorical journey. The story achieves a complete arc within the word constraint, moving from problem (seeking recipes) to resolution (deciding whether to continue the legacy). The pacing is particularly strong, with the climactic moment at the coaster's peak providing perfect symbolic alignment with the character's realization. The cause-effect relationships are logical, though the ghost's appearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is exceptionally well-utilized, with the decaying roller coaster serving as perfect metaphor for the aristocrat's fallen status. Sensory details are vivid and evocative—"rotting cotton candy and iron," "creaking tracks," and the visual contrast of "neon and shadow." The atmosphere of decay and faded glory directly enhances the theme of legacy's burden, creating a cohesive world where setting and concept are inextricably linked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout, particularly the roller coaster as metaphor for family history's ups and downs. The central conflict between preserving or abandoning harmful legacy is clearly established and resolved with the seed metaphor. The ending achieves poignancy through its open-ended yet decisive moment. The theme of choosing how to let the past die rather than blindly preserving it emerges organically from the narrative. The story successfully shows rather than tells the character's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, particularly in the haunted roller coaster as vehicle for ancestral visions. The language is generally purposeful with some genuinely fresh metaphors ("the roller coaster looming like a skeletal hand"). However, certain phrases like "the weight of his decision lighter yet sharper than before" feel somewhat formulaic. The emotional resonance is authentic but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. The story avoids most AI-typical patterns but has moments of overly precise description.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused narrative with clear thematic purpose. The ending leaves readers with lingering questions about Alistair's choice and its implications, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. While some transitions could be smoother and certain elements more deeply explored, the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking and effective storytelling within constraints.</comment>
