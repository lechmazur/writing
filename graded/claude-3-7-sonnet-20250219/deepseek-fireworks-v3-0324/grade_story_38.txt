<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's character is well-established through their relationship with the attic and botanical samples. Their internal conflict about beauty, violence, and neglect reveals depth. However, the character lacks specificity—we get their thoughts but little sense of their unique voice or personal history that would make them truly distinctive. The motivation to discover non-violence is present but could be more deeply integrated into their character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from the poet's initial unease to their epiphany about listening rather than eliminating the whispers. The arc is complete within the word constraint, with a satisfying resolution. However, the "eliminate" action feels somewhat underdeveloped—it's unclear what exactly the poet initially wanted to eliminate and why. The connection between the drunken confessions and the main narrative thread could be stronger to enhance plot cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is vividly rendered with excellent sensory details—the scent of damp paper, the subway's vibrations, the draft scattering pages. The juxtaposition of the isolated attic with the pulsing city below creates effective tension. The atmosphere of "empty abundance" permeates the piece, with the emptiness filled by whispers and botanical decay. The setting and timeframe work together to create a liminal space that enhances the story's themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses botanical imagery as metaphor for the poet's internal state, with the dried orchid and wilted fern serving as powerful symbols. The central conflict between silencing/eliminating and listening/preserving creates meaningful tension. The epiphany about non-violence being presence rather than absence offers substantive thematic depth. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the poet's emotional state, and some metaphors (like whispers as vines) feel slightly overworked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and thoughtful integration of elements. The botanical metaphors are fresh, and the exploration of non-violence as presence rather than absence shows originality. However, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("the poet traced a finger along the spine of a notebook"), and the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern of confusion-to-epiphany. The whispers metaphor, while effective, occasionally verges on purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of presence, attention, and growth amid decay. The botanical samples and haunted setting work particularly well together. The brevity feels purposeful rather than limiting. While some elements (particularly the drunken confessions) feel less organically integrated, the overall piece achieves a meditative quality that lingers after reading, suggesting depth beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
