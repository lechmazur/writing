<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The woodsman's character is effectively shaped by his guilt and the weight of "promises unkept." His motivation to escape his past through mapping railways while carrying the hairbrush as a talisman creates a compelling psychological portrait. However, we lack specifics about his relationship with the dying person, which would deepen his characterization beyond the somewhat generic portrayal of grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from the woodsman's initial state of avoidance to his moment of catharsis when he finally speaks "her name." The structure effectively uses the water tower as both physical and metaphorical space for transformation. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with his emotional release occurring too quickly and neatly for the depth of guilt established earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and water tower create a hauntingly effective atmosphere that mirrors the character's emotional state. The sensory details—"the scent of damp metal and old rain," the "symphony of static," and the physical sensation of striking the tower wall—create a richly immersive environment where the invisible (radio waves, guilt, memory) becomes tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the hairbrush and radio waves as metaphors for connection and memory. The central theme of confession leading to release is powerfully conveyed through both action and symbolism. The ending achieves emotional resonance through the woodsman's transformation. However, the story occasionally relies on telling emotional states ("despairing cheer") rather than fully showing them through action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-typical patterns, phrases like "artfully messy" appear twice without variation, and certain descriptions ("despairing cheer") feel somewhat forced. The emotional arc follows a predictable pattern of guilt-to-release without surprising turns. The metaphors around radio waves and echoes, while effective, occasionally border on being too neat in their symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The radio wave garden and water tower create a distinctive setting that enhances the themes of communication and emotional release. However, the story's brevity constrains full exploration of the woodsman's relationship with the dying person, limiting the emotional impact of the resolution.</comment>
