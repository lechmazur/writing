<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mercenary's shakiness and careful recklessness are well-integrated into his characterization, showing physical manifestation of his internal conflict. His motivation to make peace with his past drives his actions consistently. However, his background remains somewhat vague, and the transformation from "shaky" to "no longer shaky" feels slightly rushed rather than earned through deeper character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from seeking to resolution, with the amber spider serving as an effective symbolic vehicle. The story achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints. However, the mechanism by which the amber actually connects to his past remains underdeveloped, and the spider's animation feels somewhat convenient rather than properly foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral repurposed as a street art haven creates a compelling juxtaposition of sacred and profane, perfectly mirroring the character's quest for redemption in an unorthodox way. The twilight setting enhances the liminal nature of the protagonist's journey. Sensory details like crunching glass and echoing voices effectively immerse the reader in this atmospheric space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber spider serves as an effective metaphor for trapped memories/past, and the story successfully builds tension around its release. The dialogue with the artist provides necessary counterpoint and raises the stakes. While the emotional payoff works, the story relies somewhat heavily on telling emotional states rather than showing them through more nuanced reactions, and the resolution feels slightly too neat given the complexity of the mercenary's past.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most obvious AI patterns but contains some overly formal phrasing and occasionally relies on stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones. The central metaphor is strong, but some descriptions like "carefully reckless" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient exploration. The dialogue occasionally serves exposition rather than revealing character through distinctive voices. The story's structure follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with the amber spider serving as both literal object and metaphorical device. The cathedral setting effectively complements the themes of redemption and release. While the piece achieves emotional resonance, it occasionally relies on somewhat abstract language rather than specific, vivid details that would ground the mercenary's past and make his catharsis more earned.</comment>
