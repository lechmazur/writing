<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara's character is well-established through her eagerness to connect with the past and her "ruthless kindness" in engaging with the ghost. Her motivation to find connection in a digital age drives her actions consistently. However, her personality could be more deeply revealed through specific reactions or internal dialogue rather than primarily through exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Clara's discovery of the box to her understanding of the ghost's purpose, with the poltergeist activity effectively driving narrative tension. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, moving from mystery to resolution as Clara helps the seamstress ghost complete unfinished business. The cause-effect relationships are logical and the pacing effectively balances exposition with action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman villa creates a compelling juxtaposition of ancient and modern that perfectly suits the story's themes of connection across time. Sensory details like "sun-bleached mosaics," "exposed wiring," and the "chill crawling up her spine" effectively establish atmosphere. The setting meaningfully enhances both the supernatural elements and Clara's search for authentic connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sewing metaphor throughout, creating resonant symbolism around mending, connection, and threads that tie past to present. The emotional arc is satisfying as Clara moves from isolation to connection. The theme of finding meaning through engagement with the past is well-developed, and the ending provides both resolution and thematic reinforcement. The story shows rather than tells Clara's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI pitfalls, some phrases like "ruthless in her kindness" feel slightly forced. The ghost seamstress concept, while executed well, follows somewhat predictable supernatural patterns. The writing occasionally relies on abstract descriptions ("a wager of faith between the living and dead") rather than concrete specifics. However, the story maintains consistent tone and the metaphor of sewing/mending is used with originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The supernatural premise serves the deeper theme of connection across time and the digital divide. While some descriptions could be more concrete, the story achieves depth within its constraints and leaves the reader with the lingering idea that meaningful connections can transcend conventional boundaries. The ending effectively ties the personal ghost story to a broader human experience.</comment>
