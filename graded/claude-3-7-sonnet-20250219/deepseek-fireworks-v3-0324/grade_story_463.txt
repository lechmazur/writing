<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dry-witted sentinel is well-established through his smirking, muttering, and calculated approach to the ghost. His motivation to learn traditional methods rather than mourn them creates compelling tension, especially as we see him learning the waltz "just to spite" the ghost. The character's relationship with the rope reveals his complex feelings about duty and his predecessors. However, some aspects of his internal conflict could be more deeply explored within the word limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the beginning (crossing off the final name) with the end (the sentinel's name remaining uncrossed), creating a satisfying arc within tight constraints. The confiscation of the rope drives the narrative forward and connects to the central conflict. The waltz serves as both literal action and metaphor for the sentinel's struggle with the ghost. The pacing effectively builds tension through the dance sequence to the climactic moment when the rope is severed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered through sensory details like the howling storm, groaning floorboards, and the lighthouse beam "cutting through the night." The atmosphere of decay and isolation perfectly complements the concept of eroding promises. The rope, lighthouse, and storm are meaningfully interconnected symbols that enhance the ghostly confrontation. The setting becomes an active participant in the narrative rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—the rope representing both suicide and connection, the waltz embodying both conflict and communion. The central theme of keeping promises amid decay resonates throughout. The ending offers satisfying resolution while maintaining ambiguity. Particularly effective is the use of the lighthouse beam as both literal and metaphorical sentinel. The prose is evocative without becoming purple, though a few phrases ("dance between duty and decay") verge on overwritten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its approach to the ghost story genre. The metaphors feel fresh ("the storm howled like a chorus of broken vows") and specific to this narrative. The emotional landscape is conveyed through action rather than stated feelings. The narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout, with the sentinel's dry wit serving as an effective counterpoint to the supernatural elements. The waltz as confrontation is a particularly inventive device that avoids cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, particularly the rope and the waltz, which function as both literal objects/actions and metaphorical devices. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about duty, tradition, and the nature of promises that transcend the explicit narrative. The prose style balances evocative imagery with clarity.</comment>
