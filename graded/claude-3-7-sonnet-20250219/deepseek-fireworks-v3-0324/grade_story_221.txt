<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is seamlessly integrated into her character, informing both her actions and emotional journey. Her motivation to reconcile with her father's memory while establishing her own identity is clear and consistent. The character demonstrates genuine emotional complexity through her relationship with grief, showing nuanced development as she transitions from mourning to acceptance. However, her "voice" could be more distinctive, and some aspects of her ghost-whispering abilities feel underexplored relative to their importance to her identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively weaves the protagonist's visit to the abandoned carnival into a meaningful journey of emotional resolution. The narrative arc is complete despite the word constraint, moving from grief to acceptance with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The amber serves as an effective plot device connecting past and present. The pacing manages the emotional beats well, though the ghost's appearance and the gallery lights coming to life feel slightly rushed and could benefit from more setup to enhance their impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creates a hauntingly effective backdrop that mirrors the protagonist's emotional state. Sensory details—crunching glass, rusted rifle, flickering lights, and the scent of cotton candy—create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that balances decay with nostalgia. The setting perfectly complements the themes of memory and loss, while the contrast between abandonment and the brief revival of the gallery lights creates a powerful metaphorical space for the character's emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively employs symbolism throughout—particularly the amber with its trapped insect mirroring both preserved memories and emotional stasis. The narrative successfully "shows" the protagonist's emotional journey through action and sensory detail rather than telling. The central theme of reconciling with loss while finding one's own path emerges organically. The ending achieves emotional resonance without becoming sentimental. However, some metaphors (particularly "thawing heart") feel slightly overused rather than developed with fresh perspective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story largely avoids clichés in its treatment of grief and memory, offering a fresh perspective through the unique character occupation and setting. However, some phrases ("the courage to dive into her own uncharted waters") veer toward predictable metaphorical territory. The emotional arc follows a somewhat conventional pattern of grief-to-acceptance without significant subversion. While the prose is generally strong, occasional moments of purple prose ("the thawing heart in her chest ached") and repetitive imagery slightly diminish the overall originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each component serves the emotional journey rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused emotional snapshot. The amber, ghost whispering, and carnival setting combine in unexpected ways that enrich the central theme of processing grief. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of memory and legacy that extend beyond the explicit narrative. Minor weaknesses in originality and occasional overwrought phrasing prevent a higher score.</comment>
