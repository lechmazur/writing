<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's character is well-developed through his internal conflict and physical description. His motivation to confront his past regrets is clear and consistent throughout. The emotional journey from reluctance to acceptance shows meaningful development, though his backstory remains somewhat vague, preventing a perfect score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds tension from the knight's initial hesitation to his final acceptance. The narrative arc is complete despite the word constraint, with the knight's transformation providing satisfying resolution. The pattern of objects creates coherent symbolism that drives the plot forward, though the exact nature of his regret could be more specific.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is masterfully rendered with sensory details like salt, wind, and the "grudgingly sweet scent of decaying roses." The mirrored reflection concept is brilliantly integrated with the physical space, creating a psychological landscape that perfectly embodies the knight's internal journey. The atmosphere of isolation and confrontation is palpable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its metaphorical landscape and the knight's journey toward acceptance. The mirror as confrontation with past failure is particularly effective. The central theme of carrying rather than silencing regret emerges organically. While the prose occasionally verges on purple ("joyful agony"), the storytelling generally shows rather than tells, creating genuine resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its psychological landscape and the metaphor of objects as manifestations of regret. However, some phrases ("tears mixing with salt on his cheeks") feel somewhat formulaic, and the knight's redemption arc follows a relatively predictable pattern. The emotional nuance is generally strong but occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than demonstrated ones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The knight's emotional journey feels authentic despite the brevity, and the lighthouse setting serves the theme rather than merely providing backdrop. The ending achieves poignancy through its bittersweet acceptance, leaving the reader with lingering questions about redemption and regret.</comment>
