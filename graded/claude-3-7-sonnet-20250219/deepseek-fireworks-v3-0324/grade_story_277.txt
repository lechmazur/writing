<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's uncertainty is consistently portrayed through her actions and internal state. Her motivation to "cultivate sparks in unlit corners" drives the narrative and informs her decisive moment. However, we could benefit from more specific personal stakes or background to understand why this particular mission matters to her beyond abstract preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to choice to transformation, with the unmasking action driving the narrative forward. The labyrinth method integrates seamlessly with the workshop setting and the character's journey. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the giant's sudden appearance feels slightly convenient rather than properly foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through vivid sensory details and contrasting imageryâ€”dust and embers, shadows and light, abandonment and potential. The workshop setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical landscape, with the labyrinth pattern brilliantly connecting setting to action. The fractured beauty tone permeates every description, creating a cohesive and immersive world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (ember, fire, labyrinth) to explore themes of preservation versus innovation. The central conflict between honoring the past and creating the future resolves in a satisfying way that transforms the protagonist. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments of decision. The final lines deliver emotional resonance and thematic clarity, though some metaphors could be more original.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some phrases ("her uncertainty a weight in her chest") rely on familiar emotional descriptors. The imagery, while evocative, occasionally defaults to expected associations (flames "painting" in gold). The narrative maintains consistent tone and style throughout, but certain metaphors like the cathedral comparison feel somewhat conventional rather than startlingly original.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The elements serve the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a mythic quality appropriate to the content. The ending leaves readers with the resonant idea that preservation sometimes requires transformation, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
