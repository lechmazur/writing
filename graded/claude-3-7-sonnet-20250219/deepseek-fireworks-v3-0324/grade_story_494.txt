<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman's character arc is well-developed through his transformation from pride to humility. His internal conflict between outward confidence and inner doubt creates compelling tension. The character's motivation shifts believably from seeking validation to genuine learning. However, his initial arrogance could have been more distinctly shown through action rather than stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from confrontation to transformation, with the swordsman's journey from arrogance to humility forming a complete narrative. The integration of the tapestry as a symbol of his fragmented potential works effectively. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing the character's internal shift, and some transitions between emotional states feel slightly rushed within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard creates a powerful symbolic space where precision, tradition, and artistry converge. The moonlight, ink, and silence establish a contemplative atmosphere that enhances the thematic tension. Sensory details like the "air thick with ink and memory" effectively immerse the reader in this world of contrasting disciplines. The setting perfectly frames the character's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tapestry fragment as a multifaceted symbol for the swordsman's fragmented self. The contrast between blade and brush creates meaningful thematic tension. The narrative successfully builds to an emotionally resonant conclusion with the swordsman's transformation feeling earned. The recurring motifs of light/darkness and binding/releasing create depth. Some metaphors occasionally border on being too explicit rather than allowing readers to make connections.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-typical patterns, certain phrases like "harsh tenderness" appear repetitively. Some metaphors ("truth they carried as heavy as the sword") feel somewhat conventional. The emotional progression is generally authentic, but occasionally relies on stating feelings rather than showing them. The writing demonstrates individual style in its use of fragmented sentences and parallel structure, though some transitions between emotional states could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about transformation and self-discovery. The symbolic interplay between swordsmanship and calligraphy creates meaningful thematic depth. The brevity works well for this moment of realization. While occasionally relying on telling rather than showing emotional states, the story leaves readers with a resonant meditation on how pride can constrain potential. The ending effectively balances resolution with openness.</comment>
