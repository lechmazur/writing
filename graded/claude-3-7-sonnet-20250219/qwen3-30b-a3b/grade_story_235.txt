<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The characters of Aiko and Haru are well-developed through their actions and symbolic exchanges rather than explicit description. Their motivations are clear—connection through indirect communication—and consistent throughout. The herbalist attribute shapes Aiko's relationship with nature and her quiet disposition. Both characters maintain distinct personalities without dialogue, showing restraint and depth. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into their internal struggles or backstories to elevate them beyond their symbolic roles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally through the repositioning of the flower book and the gradual development of Aiko and Haru's relationship. The meteor shower decoding creates an effective climax that ties their connection to the discovery of the hidden garden. The narrative arc is complete within the constraints, moving from isolation to connection with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The pacing effectively builds tension through their symbolic exchanges, culminating in their wordless meeting at the terrace. The structure supports the intertwined fates concept without feeling contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Japanese castle provides an exceptional atmospheric foundation, with sensory details (scent of yuzu, camellia, jasmine; cold visible breath; moonlit arches) creating immersive texture. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical landscape, evolving from "shadow" and "isolation" to "shared secret." Time is effectively handled through meteor showers and art classes. The garden, castle ruins, and astronomical events are seamlessly integrated, creating a world that feels both tangible and mystical—perfectly supporting the distant intimacy tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its masterful use of symbolism—particularly the flowers, petals, and sketches as physical manifestations of unspoken communication. The central tension between isolation and connection is subtly maintained and resolved with satisfying emotional payoff. Literary techniques include effective imagery (meteor patterns aligning with flowers), metaphor (castle as stage), and parallelism in their exchanges. The theme of finding connection through non-verbal means is profoundly explored. The showing-not-telling approach creates a contemplative mood that lingers beyond the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its approach to communication and connection. The writing avoids most AI-typical patterns, with genuine emotional nuance and specific rather than generic sensory details. The metaphors (bridge between solitude, silent stage) feel fresh. However, a few phrases ("dramatic subtle gestures," "forever entwined") verge on purple prose, and certain transitions have an overly formal quality. The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. While mostly authentic, these moments of stylistic inconsistency prevent the highest rating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating multiple assigned elements, seamlessly integrating them into a unified narrative. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each sentence contributing meaningfully to atmosphere, character, or plot. The creative handling of non-verbal communication through physical objects demonstrates innovative thinking. The story's greatest strength is its ability to create emotional resonance through subtlety and suggestion, leaving readers with a lingering sense of the fragile beauty of human connection. Minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent a higher score.</comment>
