<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The observer's "aggressively kind" attribute drives their determination to preserve traditions, showing consistency between trait and motivation. However, the character remains too ethereal and abstract—we understand what they want but not who they are. Their spectral nature creates distance rather than depth, leaving their personality underdeveloped despite clear motivations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the flinging action as a pivotal moment connecting the observer's motivation to the outcome. The causal relationship between the whistle striking the window and the revival of traditions is clear. However, while there is a discernible arc from dormancy to awakening, the middle section feels somewhat compressed, with the transition from action to resolution occurring too rapidly for full dramatic impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting brilliantly amplifies the themes of forgotten wisdom and ancient traditions. Sensory details are particularly strong—the "rusted gears," "broken glass," and "jagged light" create a tangible atmosphere of decay and potential rebirth. The integration of the whale's call with the maritime setting creates a cohesive world where the supernatural feels natural rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—particularly the lighthouse as both physical structure and metaphor for illuminating lost knowledge. The parallelism between the dancer and lighthouse ("arms arched upward, mirroring the lighthouse's spire") creates meaningful resonance. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by overreliance on abstract concepts rather than concrete stakes, and the theme of tradition preservation, while clear, lacks specific cultural context that would give it greater weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The writing shows originality in its symbolic approach but suffers from excessive lyricism that sometimes prioritizes poetic phrasing over narrative clarity. Phrases like "a harmony of past and present, fragile yet unbroken" and "its legacy lingered in the breath of the wind" read as generic abstractions rather than specific, earned moments. The repetitive sentence structure across paragraphs creates a mechanical rhythm that undermines the organic flow a story about ancient traditions should possess.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creative integration of disparate elements (whale calls, lighthouses, dancers, whistles) into a cohesive supernatural narrative. The thematic exploration of preservation has genuine depth, but the execution relies too heavily on abstract imagery and statement rather than dramatic realization. While atmospheric and occasionally striking, the story's impact is diminished by its preference for telling us about significance rather than allowing us to witness it through more concrete, specific events.</comment>
