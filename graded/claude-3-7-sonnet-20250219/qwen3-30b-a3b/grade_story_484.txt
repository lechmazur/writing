<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brewer's character has clear motivations connected to his values, but his personality lacks depth. His relationship to brewing feels underdeveloped beyond surface mentions. His transformation is stated rather than shown, and his emotional journey relies too heavily on abstract statements like "the scent of hops and regret" without specific backstory or concrete character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the graveyard to confrontation with darkness, and the mirror shard provides a consistent focus throughout. However, the connections between the protest, brewing, and the mansion remain tenuous. The resolution feels rushed and relies on vague statements rather than specific actions with clear consequences. The initiation action drives the plot but its mechanism remains unclear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard creates a genuinely atmospheric setting with effective sensory details like crunching leaves and groaning steps. The darkness is effectively personified as "a living thing, coiling around the mansion's bones." The juxtaposition of brewing craft with supernatural elements creates an interesting tension, though the protest element feels disconnected from the established atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism through the mirror reflecting the brewer's idealized self, but many elements remain underdeveloped. The conflict between values and compromise has potential but lacks specific stakes. The ending provides resolution but feels somewhat generic without clarifying what exactly has changed. The writing shows moments of lyrical strength, particularly in descriptions of darkness, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing the character's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The writing contains multiple instances of overly abstract language and generic sensory details. Phrases like "the scent of hops and regret" and "a testament to the values he'd fought to embody" lack specificity. The mirror shard's powers follow predictable supernatural tropes without subversion. The story's emotional arc follows a formulaic redemption pattern, and the dialogue ("Let's see if your values hold up to a little light") feels artificially constructed rather than natural speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story successfully incorporates all required elements, many feel mechanically inserted rather than organically integrated. The contrast between brewing and supernatural elements creates some interesting tension, but the underdeveloped connection to the protest weakens the narrative cohesion. The writing shows flashes of imagination but relies too heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete details, leaving the reader with atmosphere but insufficient emotional or thematic resonance.</comment>
