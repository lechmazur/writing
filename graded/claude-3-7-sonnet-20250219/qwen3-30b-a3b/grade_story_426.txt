<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pathfinder's secretive nature and motivation to preserve folk medicines are consistently portrayed. Her "angrily peaceful defiance" manifests in her actions, though this attribute could be more deeply integrated. The character shows determination when confronting the prodigy's ghost, revealing emotional depth. However, we lack insight into her background and what personally drives her beyond the general mission, limiting the full development of her character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution with logical cause-effect relationships. The teapot effectively serves as both plot device and symbol. The hacking of music playlists cleverly initiates the journey, and the concluding discovery of the greenhouse provides satisfying closure. While the ghost's appearance moves the plot forward, the transition feels slightly abrupt, and some elements (like marathon training) feel tangential rather than integral to the plot structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is richly evoked through sensory details—mildew scent, broken glass, flickering lights, and jagged shadows. The atmosphere perfectly balances eerie abandonment with nostalgic wonder. The ghost train provides both literal and metaphorical pathways through the narrative. The setting's decay mirrors the forgotten nature of the prodigy's work, creating a cohesive world where setting and theme reinforce each other naturally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism—particularly the cracked teapot representing both brokenness and potential healing. The central conflict between preservation and forgetting creates meaningful tension. The ghost encounter provides emotional resonance, and the final message about healing through remembrance elevates the piece beyond its plot. The dialogue, though limited, feels purposeful. However, the theme could be explored with more nuance, and certain elements (like the marathon training) feel underutilized in service of the larger message.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the story employs vivid imagery, some descriptions ("her heart a storm of fear," "her heart a quiet storm of purpose") feel formulaic. The narrative relies on several ghost story tropes without fully subverting them. The language occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate ("forgotten dreams," "clung to the park like dust"). The emotional shifts—particularly from fear to acceptance—occur without sufficient development. However, the integration of folk medicine with haunted settings shows originality, and the teapot as both vessel and map demonstrates creative thinking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thoughtful symbolism and atmospheric setting. The cracked teapot becomes a powerful metaphor for preservation of broken things. The piece demonstrates creative thinking in connecting music, medicine, and memory. While some elements feel less organically integrated (marathon training, hacking playlists), and certain emotional transitions happen too quickly for their weight, the overall effect is a compelling ghost story with a meaningful message about preservation of forgotten knowledge.</comment>
