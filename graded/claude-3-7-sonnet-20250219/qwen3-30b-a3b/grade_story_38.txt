<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's character is well-developed through his relationship with botanical samples and his struggle with inner demons. His motivation to find peace through non-violence feels authentic, especially as it emerges from "a childhood where anger had been a currency." However, the character lacks some dimensionality—we get glimpses of his past but limited insight into his specific fears or desires beyond broad emotional states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from the poet's struggle with whispers to his discovery of peace through lavender, creating a satisfying emotional arc. However, the transition from haunted torment to resolution feels somewhat abrupt. The "elimination" action drives the narrative but could be more thoroughly developed to show the poet's specific journey from chaos to acceptance. The story achieves coherence despite constraints but would benefit from more tension in its middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting works exceptionally well, serving as both literal space and metaphor for the poet's mind. The juxtaposition with the subway creates effective tension between isolation and urban chaos. Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric: "whispers coiled like ivy through the rafters," "the silence here was a living thing." The environment actively participates in the narrative, making the setting a character in itself rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through its exploration of inner turmoil and the search for peace. The lavender as symbol for healing is effective, and the metaphors connecting botanical elements to human experience create depth. However, the conflict resolution feels somewhat simplified—the lavender's immediate effect seems too easy a solution for such deep-seated issues. The theme of finding peace through acceptance rather than elimination develops nicely but could be rendered with more complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the writing avoids obvious AI patterns, there are moments of overly lofty phrasing that feel slightly artificial: "the weight of the world no longer a chain but a rhythm he could dance to." Some metaphors, while beautiful, read as somewhat generic: "like roots splitting stone." The narrative has authenticity in its central concept but occasionally relies on poetic abstractions rather than specific, grounded details that would make the character's journey more distinctive and less universalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves together disparate elements into a cohesive whole while maintaining a consistent tone. The exploration of finding peace amidst chaos resonates beyond the immediate narrative. However, the resolution comes too easily given the depth of the character's struggles. The story's strongest aspect is its atmospheric quality, creating a world that feels simultaneously real and dreamlike, though it occasionally sacrifices concrete specificity for poetic abstraction.</comment>
