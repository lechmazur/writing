<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's forgetfulness is well integrated into her character, creating tension between her preservation mission and her inability to remember details. Her motivation to protect fragile objects mirrors her own vulnerability. However, her development remains somewhat static, and the dialogue with Étienne, while revealing her character, doesn't show significant growth or change beyond her initial motivations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative maintains coherence from Lila's discovery to the resolution with Étienne, with the negotiation serving as an effective pivot point. The plot has a clear arc within the word constraint, though the science fair setting feels abruptly introduced and underdeveloped compared to the richly established vault setting. The causal relationships are logical, with the final performance providing effective temporal framing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault beneath Paris is exceptionally well-rendered through sensory details—echoing boots, damp stone, the hum of music, and the scent of aged wine. The setting perfectly complements both the fragile stained glass and Lila's preservation instinct, creating a subterranean sanctuary that contrasts with the "noise of progress" above. The vault becomes a character itself, resonating with the themes of preservation versus discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the stained glass fragment as a metaphor for memory and cultural preservation. The tension between Lila and Étienne embodies the central theme of balancing preservation with discovery. The ending achieves poignancy through the image of city lights blurring into a mosaic, echoing the stained glass. However, the "cultural clash" aspect remains somewhat abstract rather than specifically developed, and some emotional beats feel stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, it occasionally relies on telling rather than showing ("her heart lighter") and employs some generic phrasing ("defied time," "edges softened"). The narrative maintains consistent tone but includes several predictable metaphorical connections between the fragment and memory. The vault-as-metaphor for preservation is somewhat expected, though the execution has moments of genuine insight about the tension between remembering and forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole, particularly the champagne vault, the stained glass fragment, and Lila's forgetfulness. The narrative demonstrates thoughtful connections between setting, character, and theme. However, the science fair element feels forced, and the "cultural clash" remains underdeveloped. The story achieves emotional resonance through its meditation on preservation versus progress, though some passages trend toward overwritten prose.</comment>
