<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tailor's character is well-developed through their dual role as book restorer and investigator. Their restlessness manifests in their willingness to risk safety to uncover truth. The character demonstrates consistent motivation aligned with their established traits, particularly when they use their tailoring skills to gain access to restricted areas. Their interaction with Alma reveals depth and purpose. The "earnestly deceptive" attribute is skillfully incorporated into their investigative methods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves cohesively from discovery to investigation to confrontation with remarkable economy. The narrative achieves a complete arc despite the word constraint, with the protagonist's discovery of the lantern seamlessly initiating their journey. The connection between the bookshop mysteries and the actual crime is cleverly executed, and the resolution feels earned. Cause-and-effect relationships remain clear throughout, though the revelation of the manager's scheme could have been more gradually developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Martian biodome setting is exceptionally realized with sensory details that feel authentic yet alien—"air tasted brittle," "inked copper" smell. The forgotten lantern serves as both literal and metaphorical light in this environment. The atmosphere perfectly balances isolation, mystery, and the fragility of human existence on Mars. The juxtaposition of mundane bookshop operations against the backdrop of survival on an inhospitable planet creates compelling tension throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—oxygen as both literal necessity and metaphor for truth, books representing both knowledge and deception. The prose is lyrical without becoming purple, employing evocative imagery like "maps of vanished craters fluttered like moths seeking home." The conflict between preservation of knowledge and corruption is effectively established and resolved. The ghost character serves as both plot device and thematic reinforcement, adding emotional resonance to what could have been merely a mystery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates genuine originality in its fusion of tailor/bookshop/Mars elements, avoiding predictable sci-fi tropes. The prose maintains consistent tone and style throughout. Metaphors feel fresh rather than generic—"sculpt a new tomorrow from ruin" and "a tremor that loosened every false spine." The narrative avoids AI-typical logical leaps or inconsistencies. The only slight weakness is occasional density of imagery that risks overwhelming rather than illuminating the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous elements. Each assigned component feels essential rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating urgency that mirrors the protagonist's quest. The narrative leaves readers with lingering questions about memory, truth, and survival that transcend the immediate plot. The writing demonstrates exceptional creativity in weaving together disparate elements into a satisfying whole that feels both complete and suggestive of a larger world.</comment>
