<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's character is exceptionally well-developed through consistent actions that reinforce his peculiar sincerity. His gentle nature manifests in how he "apologizes to the page for every scratch" and charges only "a loaf" for his services. The character's motivation to decode the universal riddle is clearly established and drives his methodical daily ritual. His distinctiveness comes through in his respectful interactions with everything around him—from bones to dew drops—creating a character whose depth exceeds the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc despite brevity: the necromancer's quest, his daily ritual, and the culminating revelation that changes him. The method of using dew drops to decode the tapestry creates a logical throughline. The ending offers genuine resolution while maintaining mystique—the universal riddle becomes "smaller, like a door already opening inward," signaling transformation without over-explaining. The cause-effect relationships between the necromancer's actions and discoveries are meticulously established throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is rendered with remarkable specificity through sensory details like "roots and pipes," "spiral courtyards," and the market that "hummed." The juxtaposition of necromancy with playground sounds creates a uniquely gentle atmosphere that perfectly supports the theme of kindness recognizing itself. The setting feels fully realized through small, telling details—the vents where "the world above exhaled," the cobblestones, the tea-offering skull salesman—all contributing to a world that feels simultaneously magical and lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves exceptional impact through its layered symbolism and thematic coherence. The broken pen that creates agreements between living and dead serves as a perfect metaphor for the character's role as mediator. The story's core message about carrying "every name as if it were your own" resonates beyond the immediate narrative. The ending achieves profound emotional impact through understatement, showing the necromancer integrating his discovery by creating agreements "that let quarrels rest without winning or losing"—demonstrating theme through action rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story exhibits remarkable originality in its premise and execution. Language is fresh throughout, with distinctive imagery like "words arranged themselves like shy moths landing" and emotions "evergreen" moving inside ribs. The necromancer's gentle temperament avoids both stereotypical dark brooding and saccharine sweetness. The goblin market setting sidesteps fantasy clichés by focusing on mundane moments of beauty and connection. There's an individual authorial voice evident in the consistent tone of respectful wonder and the way metaphors consistently serve the theme of interconnection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion and depth within its constraints. All assigned elements feel essential rather than forced, working in concert to explore the theme of gentle connection across boundaries. The mystical simplicity tone perfectly serves both character and concept. The brevity feels deliberate—each sentence carries multiple layers of meaning without becoming dense or impenetrable. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about the nature of kindness and communication that extend well beyond its fantastical setting, demonstrating exceptional literary craft and thematic resonance.</comment>
