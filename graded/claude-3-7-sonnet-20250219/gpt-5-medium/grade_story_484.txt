<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brewer's voice is distinctive and consistent, with clear motivation to embody values of "craft, patience, and neighborliness." The character reveals depth through introspection and the mirror metaphor. Their actions align with their established motivation as they move from self-reflection to commitment. However, the character's initial reason for visiting the graveyard could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves cohesively from graveyard contemplation to spiritual awakening to renewed purpose, with the initiation ritual forming a clear arc. The discolored staircase effectively transitions the narrative. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the connection between the broken mirror and the character's epiphany could be strengthened for greater narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere blending the haunted graveyard with distant civil unrest. The juxtaposition creates tension while sensory details ("trailing steam," "stale foam," darkness that "pools like porter") immerse readers. The setting powerfully amplifies the character's introspection about values, with the physical boundary of the fence paralleling moral boundaries in society.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through layered metaphors (brewing as moral action, mirror as self-reflection). The conflict between personal values and social responsibility resolves meaningfully with the brewer's commitment to serve both the dead and protestors. Strong showing-not-telling through actions like pouring foam on the staircase. The theme of performative versus lived values resonates beyond the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates distinctive style with fresh metaphors ("darkness pools like porter") and avoids AI-typical patterns. The brewing metaphors feel authentic and specific rather than generic. There's genuine emotional resonance in the character's self-confrontation. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout with human-like nuance in how the character processes their moral obligations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with philosophical depth. The brewing metaphor extends naturally throughout, creating thematic resonance rather than feeling forced. The brevity enhances rather than limits the impact, creating a concentrated meditation on values and action. The story lingers after reading, suggesting meanings beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
