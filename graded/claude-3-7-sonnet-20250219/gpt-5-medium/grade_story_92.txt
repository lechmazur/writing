<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is compellingly drawn through a distinctive first-person voice that balances pragmatism with poetic observation. Their motivation to "map the forbidden corridors" aligns perfectly with their carefully calculated movements through the mansion. The narrator's relationship with fear—standing where it "dares not tread"—reveals deep character complexity, while their interactions with both the dogs and the heiress show subtle emotional intelligence. The character's deliberate posture of knowing "what not to know" creates intriguing psychological depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses with elegant inevitability from the initial entrance to the spectral dinner service, with the blood drive encounter serving as an effective inciting incident. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, building to the powerful final agreement to "walk her absence." Cause-and-effect relationships—particularly between the narrator's steadiness and the ghosts' acceptance—are clear and logical. The pacing expertly balances atmospheric development with narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion dining room becomes a character itself, with the "loud silence" pressing against ribs creating palpable tension. The twilight setting perfectly enhances the liminal nature of the encounter. Sensory details—crystal domes, trembling handwriting, carnivorous blooms—build an extraordinarily vivid atmosphere that blends beauty with menace. The physical environment directly influences character behavior (dogs heeling without command) and reinforces the underlying themes of service and witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional resonance through its exploration of service, witness, and the currency of attention. Literary devices—particularly the recurring motif of "carefully careless" movements and the personification of the house—create sophisticated layers of meaning. The central conflict between preservation and consumption (the house that "feeds on promises") is subtly developed. The final agreement delivers a haunting conclusion that expands rather than resolves the story's tensions, leaving readers with lingering questions about loss, duty, and connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates impressive originality in its metaphors ("the heiress enters like a candle turned sideways") and its fresh approach to haunting. The prose occasionally risks becoming overwrought with phrases like "patrons who paid with memories," but generally maintains control. The emotional landscape is nuanced rather than stated, revealed through physical responses and careful observations. The story's consistent tone and unique perspective on service to the supernatural demonstrates distinctive authorial vision, though occasional phrases like "porcelain, fragile currency" verge on purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story masterfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than constrained. The brevity becomes a strength, creating an appropriately fragmentary glimpse into an ongoing relationship between the living and dead. The narrative leaves readers with profound questions about the nature of service, memory, and what constitutes being "haunted." The story achieves genuine depth by suggesting larger systems and histories beyond what's explicitly shown, demonstrating sophisticated storytelling craft within tight constraints.</comment>
