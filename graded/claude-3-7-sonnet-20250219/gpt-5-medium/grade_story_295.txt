<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sellsword's character emerges with a distinct voice and personality that balances joviality with introspection. The character's motivation to "dethrone doubt" rather than banish it completely shows psychological nuance. Their reluctant courage is consistently portrayed throughout, particularly in their decision to make doubt "a teacher without a crown." However, some aspects of the character's backstory remain underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete arc despite its brevity. The ritual with the witch flows logically from beginning to resolution, with the withering vow serving as an effective narrative spine. The transformation of the sellsword's relationship with doubt creates meaningful change. Particularly strong is how the time capsule ritual connects to the character's internal journey. The pacing occasionally feels rushed in transitioning between symbolic moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch's herb garden serves as an exceptional setting that becomes an active participant in the story. Sensory details are vivid and specific - the herbs sing, scold, and arrange shadows; steel drinks "an aroma like clean thunder." The atmosphere perfectly balances mystical elements with grounded emotion. The garden's eruption during the climax demonstrates masterful integration of setting with the character's internal transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story employs striking metaphors and fresh imagery throughout ("doubt shells itself like a dying seed," "dethroned kings can still advise from simpler chairs"). The central conflict between courage and doubt is deftly handled through showing rather than telling. The theme of transforming one's relationship with fear rather than eliminating it entirely offers genuine psychological insight. The ending satisfyingly resolves the character's journey while suggesting ongoing growth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the story exhibits considerable creativity in its metaphors and conceptualization, certain phrases occasionally veer into unnecessarily ornate territory ("cauldron of constellations," "clarinet of glass"). Some of the herb garden's reactions during the ritual sequence feel slightly overwrought. However, the story largely avoids clich√©s and demonstrates an authentic voice with consistent tone. The emotional journey feels genuine rather than stated, particularly in how the character's relationship with doubt evolves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its many assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The lyrical prose style enhances the mystical atmosphere while maintaining clarity. The exploration of doubt, courage, and transformation creates meaningful depth beyond the surface narrative. The story's brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying significant weight. What prevents a higher score is occasional moments where the metaphorical language becomes slightly excessive.</comment>
