<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and consistent, with the glamorous undertaker identity deeply integrated into every aspect of their being. Their motivation to preserve memories through a blend of traditional embalming metaphors and digital archiving feels authentic. The connection to Great Aunt Sila provides clear motivation, and the character's actions consistently reflect their dual identity as both preserver and artist. The "fruitlessly patient yet radiant" attribute manifests beautifully throughout their work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly connects the beginning to end through the cyclical nature of the narrator's work. The narrative arc follows the undertaker through their preservation process with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The action of "elongating" drives the plot forward metaphorically and literally as the narrator stretches memories across time. Some transitions between the physical and digital realms could be smoother, but overall, the coherence remains strong within the tight constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of mortuary imagery with digital archiving creates a uniquely evocative atmosphere. The social network archive becomes a tangible space through rich sensory details: "the archive scrolls like surf," pixels as breaths, and timelines measured physically. The juxtaposition of traditional embalming practices with digital preservation creates a haunting liminal space where the physical and virtual blur. The tone of "jubilant remorse" permeates every scene, creating a consistent atmosphere of bittersweet preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable impact through its layered metaphors and imagery. The undertaker's work becomes a profound meditation on memory, mortality, and meaning-making. Literary devices are masterfully deployed: "the dead keep arriving late to their own colors" and "every life here has sequins hidden beneath its ash" demonstrate exceptional craft. The story shows rather than tells, allowing emotions to emerge through actions and observations. The central theme of finding extraordinary meaning in supposedly ordinary lives resonates deeply beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates consistent originality with fresh, unexpected metaphors and a distinctive voice. The narrative maintains its unique tone throughout without falling into predictable patterns. The fusion of mortuary language with digital terminology feels innovative rather than forced. Occasional phrases like "a saint who erred" and "the brass measuring tape... a loveworn serpent" show particular creativity. While some metaphors occasionally approach purple prose territory, they generally serve the story's emotional resonance rather than distract from it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, integrating them seamlessly into the narrative rather than forcing the story around them. The metaphorical language serves the story's themes of preservation and memory, creating depth beyond the explicit narrative. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying significant weight. The lingering image of the undertaker walking home "luminous, respectfully haunted, ardently ordinary in nobody's myth" provides a powerful conclusion that resonates beyond the final line.</comment>
