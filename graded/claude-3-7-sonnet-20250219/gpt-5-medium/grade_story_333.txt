<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist embodies the "sincere rebel" identity with remarkable consistency. Their motivation to preserve traditional building methods against modernization is clear and compelling. The character's reverence for craftsmanship while operating outside official channels creates an intriguing tension. The first-person narration establishes a distinct voice that balances technical knowledge with poetic sensibility. However, the character lacks some dimensionality beyond their mission, and their emotional journey, while present, could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates exceptional coherence as the protagonist's act of theorizing directly advances the narrative from discovery to revelation. The torn sticky note serves as both catalyst and connection point. Despite the brevity, the story achieves a complete arc from entering the passage to forming a plan for the future. The cause-and-effect relationship between the protagonist's actions and the ghostly response is logically sound. The pacing effectively balances atmospheric description with plot progression, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage is rendered with extraordinary sensory richness—shifting temperatures, knocking sounds, and architectural details create an immersive environment. The "between storms" timeframe brilliantly frames the narrative and provides atmospheric tension. The setting perfectly complements the theme of preservation amid change. The passage itself becomes a character with its "breathing" and "sighing," effectively blurring boundaries between architecture and living entity. The sensory details (cedar shavings, chalked templates) ground the supernatural elements in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves profound impact through its metaphorical layering—physical restoration becomes spiritual restoration, architecture becomes philosophy. The central conflict between tradition and modernization is elegantly established and resolved through the apprenticeship revelation. The language employs fresh metaphors that serve the theme ("memory were an unsafe staircase"). The ending provides meaningful resolution while opening future possibilities. The story effectively shows rather than tells emotional states. The subtext exploring the value of craft versus efficiency resonates beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its premise and execution. The architectural metaphors feel fresh rather than clichéd. However, some phrases ("braided bitterness," "scaffolds of patience") veer toward purple prose. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate at the expense of clarity. While the emotional arc is generally well-handled, certain transitions feel slightly mechanical. The narrative voice maintains consistency throughout, though some sentences are unnecessarily complex. The ghostly guildmaster avoids typical haunting tropes, instead serving as a mentor figure in a way that feels inventive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The architectural preservation theme provides a strong framework that naturally incorporates the haunted passage, storms, and rebellion elements. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a concentrated intensity. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about tradition versus progress that extend beyond the text itself. While occasionally overwritten, the prose demonstrates technical skill and thematic unity. The story successfully balances concrete details with metaphysical exploration.</comment>
