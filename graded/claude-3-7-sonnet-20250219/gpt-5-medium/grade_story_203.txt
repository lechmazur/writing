<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The exorcist with stage fright is portrayed with remarkable nuance through the first-person narration. Their voice is distinct, characterized by poetic introspection and vulnerability. The character's motivations emerge gradually but convincingly—their inherited duty, family secrets, and desire to help trapped spirits. The stage fright is woven naturally into their actions rather than merely stated, showing how they time their "courage" and acknowledge fear while still proceeding. Their relationship with the grandmother adds depth, though some transitions between personal history and present action could be more seamless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot builds effectively from toy assembly to ghost communication to revelation about the grandmother's secret mission. The submerging action serves as a pivotal moment connecting past to present. Despite the brevity, there's a satisfying narrative arc from confronting the ghost to resolving its presence. The ending achieves both closure and opening possibilities. However, some middle sections introduce new elements without fully integrating them, creating moments where the logical progression becomes slightly disjointed—particularly regarding how the locket and map function within the exorcism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is masterfully rendered through specific, evocative details that create both physical space and emotional resonance. The "confetti" of debris, humming cargo, and "theater of vacuum" build a haunting atmosphere that perfectly complements the ghostly encounters and family secrets. The juxtaposition of cosmic vastness with intimate personal objects (pressed flowers, toys) creates compelling tension. The sensory details—rattling pages, knocking sounds, whispers—enhance the uncanny atmosphere. The setting becomes an extension of the character's isolation and the ghosts' liminal existence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through its lyrical prose and layered symbolism. Metaphors like "gravity is optional out here" function on multiple levels, connecting the physical setting to emotional and thematic elements. The story builds profound subtext around intergenerational trauma, secrets as both protection and poison, and finding voice amid silence. The ending achieves emotional resonance through its image of unlocking without locks. While occasionally the densely poetic language risks obscuring narrative clarity, the overall impact is powerful, leaving lingering questions about sacrifice, memory, and redemption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story displays remarkable originality in its fusion of ghost story, space salvage narrative, and family drama. The language avoids AI-typical patterns through its consistent and distinctive voice, unpredictable metaphors ("colors stubborn as starlight trapped in frost"), and genuinely surprising connections between seemingly disparate elements. The emotional progression feels authentically human rather than formulaic. There are occasional moments where the abstract language ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") verges on purple prose, but these are generally earned by the established voice and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story achieves an impressive cohesion despite incorporating numerous required elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, particularly how the pressed wildflowers connect to both character history and present action. The poetic style occasionally risks obscuring clarity, but generally supports the dreamlike, liminal quality of the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The story's lingering power comes from how it transforms specific objects and actions into resonant symbols for larger human experiences of inheritance, silence, and liberation.</comment>
