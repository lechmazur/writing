<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc despite its dreamlike quality, with the ranger's search for the goddess's echo providing strong narrative momentum. The fluctuations between mundane ranger duties and mystical encounters build effectively toward the climactic meeting. Cause-effect relationships maintain internal logic within the surreal framework.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed highway creates a hauntingly specific liminal space that perfectly embodies the story's themes. Sensory details are exceptional—traffic cones as crowns, the peel of thunder, static shaped like footfalls—creating a richly textured atmosphere. The post-dream timeframe establishes a melancholic yet hopeful tone that permeates every element. The setting functions not merely as backdrop but as an active participant in the narrative, with the physical landscape mirroring the protagonist's interior journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids formulaic writing through consistently fresh and surprising metaphors ("a clipboard of leaves," "a shopping bag of rain"). The surreal elements never feel random but rather contribute to a coherent alternative logic. The emotional journey feels genuinely human despite the fantastical setting, with nuanced handling of longing and connection. The story maintains a distinctive voice throughout—lyrical without becoming purple, precise without becoming clinical.
