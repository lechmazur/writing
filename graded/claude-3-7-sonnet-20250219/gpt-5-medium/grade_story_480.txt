<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The social media exorcist has a distinctive voice that effectively communicates their unique profession and worldview. Their motivation to "feed curiosity with life's raw edge" consistently drives their actions throughout the narrative. The character's "indifferent enthusiasm" creates an intriguing contradiction that manifests in their approach—clinical yet caring. However, some deeper personal stakes or growth would elevate the character beyond their professional function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly weaves from abandoned music hall to mess hall to secret clubs, with each transition feeling organic. The receipt serves as an effective plot device that connects past to present. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence despite its fragmented, poetic structure. The resolution brings satisfying closure as the protagonist facilitates collective remembrance. The only weakness is that some connective tissue between scenes could be stronger to clarify the exact nature of the hauntings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptional, blending sensory details like "iron and oranges" with evocative metaphors where "the city wrote its own score." The abandoned mess hall becomes a character itself, transforming from "barracks and ballroom, kitchen and cathedral." The juxtaposition of digital culture with physical haunting creates a unique liminal space. The setting perfectly complements the concept of memory, loss, and digital-age connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its innovative metaphors and layered symbolism. The receipt as sheet music, grief that can "buffer without disappearing," and memories arranged "like notes" create a rich subtext about how we process loss in the digital age. The prose has a haunting musicality that mirrors its subject. While emotionally resonant, some readers might find the abstract quality occasionally distances them from the emotional core.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates exceptional originality in its concept of social media exorcism and digital-age hauntings. The language avoids clichés with fresh metaphors like "curiosity ticked on, an honest, tireless little engine." The fragmented yet cohesive structure feels deliberate rather than formulaic. There's a distinctive authorial voice throughout, with consistent tone and style. The emotional nuance comes through action and atmosphere rather than stated feelings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story succeeds remarkably in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The poetic prose style enhances rather than obscures meaning. The brevity feels like a strength—each sentence carries significant weight. The exploration of how we process grief in the digital age offers genuine depth that lingers beyond the reading experience. A truly distinctive piece that demonstrates creative vision, though its abstract quality may limit accessibility for some readers.</comment>
