<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit is established but not fully developed. His motivation to learn traditional methods is clear, though his deeper connection to "eroding promises" remains somewhat underdeveloped. His interaction with the ghost shows character depth, but his emotional journey could be more nuanced. The sentinel's voice is consistent but lacks truly distinctive qualities that would make him memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from crossing off the final name to finding the journal, with the confiscation driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, connecting the beginning (completed list) to the resolution (obtaining the journal). The pacing effectively balances exposition and action, though the connection between the list and the lighthouse keeper could be more explicitly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly rendered with sensory details like "salt air and ghostly whispers." The atmosphere perfectly complements the themes of loss and duty, while the bedroom's contents (photographs, hidden journal) meaningfully expand the world. The frayed rope creates powerful symbolism within this setting, and the spectral presence is handled with subtlety rather than melodrama.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the frayed rope, crossed-off list) to explore themes of duty, regret, and preservation of memory. The parallel between Elias and the keeper creates emotional resonance, and the ending offers satisfying resolution while suggesting continuation. The narrative shows rather than tells emotional states, particularly in the ghost encounter. The theme of preserving what's valuable amid loss emerges organically from the narrative elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("eroding promises pressing upon him, urging him toward reckless precision"). The metaphors are generally fresh, but occasional phrases like "haunted by promises they could not keep" verge on clich√©. The emotional handling is nuanced, particularly in the ghost encounter, but the narrative occasionally relies on somewhat generic descriptors rather than truly specific details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The lighthouse setting, ghostly encounter, and journal quest work particularly well together. While occasionally veering toward purple prose, the writing generally supports the atmospheric tone. The parallel between Elias and the keeper creates thematic resonance that lingers beyond the immediate narrative, suggesting deeper meaning about duty and memory.</comment>
