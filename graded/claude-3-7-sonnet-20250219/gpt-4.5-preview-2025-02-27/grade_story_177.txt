<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-defined through his rebellious nature and commitment to writing obituaries for the living. His motivation to restore the "lost art form of living remembrance" is clear and consistent. The character shows growth as he discovers the consequences of his writings and adapts his approach. However, we lack deeper psychological insights into why Elias began this unusual practice, and his emotional responses sometimes feel stated rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elias's discovery of the mask to his final stand. The concept of the "labyrinth of choices" effectively drives the narrative as Elias learns how his obituaries affect people's destinies. The story achieves a sense of completeness despite its brevity. However, the revolution subplot feels somewhat underdeveloped, and the transition from Elias's personal journey to the broader revolutionary conflict happens too abruptly to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly realized and perfectly complements the themes of knowledge, fate, and hidden power. The atmosphere of rebellion and secrecy permeates the narrative effectively. The hidden pipe organ chamber creates a compelling focal point for the story's magical elements. The setting's scale and labyrinthine nature mirror the story's central concept beautifully, creating a rich symbolic landscape that enhances the narrative's impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of fate, free will, and the power of words. The mask and organ serve as compelling symbols for perception and influence. The ending achieves emotional resonance with Elias writing his own obituary. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some metaphors feel slightly overwrought. The central conflict between preserving life through words versus potentially altering destinies creates genuine philosophical tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story presents an original premise, certain elements feel formulaic. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate ("his quill danced in lucid frenzy"), and some descriptions rely on abstract concepts rather than specific sensory details. The narrative progression follows a somewhat predictable hero's journey structure. The emotional arc, while present, sometimes lacks the nuance and unpredictability of human experience, particularly in how quickly Elias masters the organ's powers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The concept of writing obituaries for the living provides a fresh perspective on mortality and legacy. The prose, while occasionally overwritten, generally supports the story's fantastical tone. The brevity works well for establishing the premise and character arc, though it limits exploration of the revolutionary context. The story leaves readers with meaningful questions about how our words shape others' lives.</comment>
