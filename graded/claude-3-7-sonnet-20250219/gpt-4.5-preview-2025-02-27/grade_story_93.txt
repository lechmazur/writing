<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's character is reasonably well-developed through his obsession with sacred geometry and labyrinths. His relationship with Mira creates emotional stakes, though her character remains underdeveloped. His motivations are clear and consistent, driving his actions throughout. However, his internal conflict lacks sufficient complexity and nuance to make him truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the closing elevator doors as a framing device that creates immediate tension. The narrative follows a clear arc from separation to crisis to resolution. The labyrinth's malfunction provides a compelling central conflict, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed and relies too heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive is richly imagined and thematically resonant with the concepts of sacred geometry and labyrinths. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical landscape. The atmosphere of isolation, urgency, and mystical connection is consistently maintained through sensory details like the crackling radio and marble floor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the labyrinth as both literal setting and metaphor for connection and understanding. The pirate radio creates an evocative auditory dimension. However, the resolution relies too heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete actions, and the emotional payoff feels somewhat unearned given the limited development of Elias and Mira's relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing, the writing occasionally slips into overly ornate phrasing ("a silent plea lingering between them") and relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The labyrinth-as-living-entity revelation feels like a convenient solution rather than an earned insight. The story avoids major clich√©s but doesn't fully transcend familiar tropes of mystical architecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic resonance. The concept of sacred geometry provides a compelling framework, and the emotional stakes feel genuine if somewhat underdeveloped. The prose is generally strong but occasionally veers toward purple. The ending provides resolution but lacks the profound impact that would elevate it to exceptional status.</comment>
