<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eldric's character is well-established through his grumpiness and solitude, with clear motivation to resolve his inner turmoil. His relationship with trauma feels authentic, though his transformation happens somewhat abruptly. The witch serves as an effective foil, but their relationship could be more deeply explored. Eldric's voice in dialogue is distinctive, revealing vulnerability beneath his gruff exterior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Eldric's arrival with the map to his acceptance of trauma. The connection between the rebels' unrest and his own internal struggle creates effective narrative tension. The pacing manages the word constraint well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The sand mandala effectively drives the plot forward as both metaphor and literal tool for transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystal scrying room illuminated by starlight creates a richly atmospheric setting that enhances the mystical tone. Sensory details like the "velvet drapes" and sand patterns that "jiggle and shift" immerse the reader effectively. The celestial imagery reinforces the theme of cosmic perspective on personal trauma, creating a cohesive atmosphere that supports both character development and plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the mandala, stars, hidden crypt) to explore trauma and healing. The parallel between the restless bones and Eldric's unresolved pain creates meaningful subtext. The narrative shows rather than tells his emotional journey, though some metaphors feel slightly overwrought. The ending provides satisfying closure while maintaining a sense of ongoing healing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI hallmarks, certain phrases ("grandiose subtlety," "multiplying singular symbols") feel somewhat artificial. The emotional progression is generally authentic, but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. Some descriptions become overly ornate ("the quiet grandeur of the room"). The concept of trauma is handled with nuance, though the resolution comes too neatly for such a complex theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The witch's crystal room and stargazing create a distinctive atmosphere that elevates the story beyond its constraints. While occasionally veering into purple prose, the writing generally serves the emotional core of Eldric's journey. The exploration of trauma as both burden and teacher offers meaningful depth within the brief format.</comment>
