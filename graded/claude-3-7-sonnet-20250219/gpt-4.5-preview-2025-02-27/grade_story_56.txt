<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Milo's character as a "bluffing swindler" is established but not deeply explored. His internal conflict about truth is clear, but his transformation feels somewhat rushed and lacks nuance. Lena appears too conveniently as a catalyst without sufficient development of her own character. Their interaction shows potential but relies on telling rather than showing their connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from Milo's initial state to his revelation, but the connection between the computer restarting and the main narrative remains tenuous. The meet-cute serves its purpose but feels somewhat contrived. The resolution comes too easily, with Lena immediately understanding Milo's metaphorical blank price tag without sufficient buildup or earned emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting of an orchard within a toppled skyscraper creates a compelling visual contrast between nature and abandoned civilization. Sensory details like "scent of ripe apples mingling with rusted metal beams" effectively establish atmosphere. The world-building successfully supports the theme of truth and reclamation, though some opportunities to deepen the connection between setting and character motivation are missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of truth and honesty, but relies too heavily on explicit statements rather than subtextual development. The blank price tag serves as an effective symbol, but the narrative tends toward telling rather than showing emotional states. Dialogue occasionally feels stilted rather than natural, particularly in the climactic revelation scene. The ending provides closure but lacks the emotional resonance a more nuanced approach might have achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: overly balanced sentence structures, unnecessarily flowery language ("energetically lethargic"), and explicitly stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones. Character reasoning follows predictable patterns, and the meet-cute feels formulaic. Metaphors like "magnetizing pull of honesty" lack freshness. The dialogue, particularly Lena's responses to Milo's revelation, follows convenient patterns rather than showing authentic human complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements adequately but often at the expense of narrative flow. While the central metaphor of the blank price tag works effectively, other elements like the restarting computer feel disconnected from the core narrative. The prose occasionally sacrifices clarity for stylistic flourishes. The brevity constrains character development, resulting in a resolution that feels more convenient than earned. Despite these limitations, the core concept of confronting hidden truths shows promise.</comment>
