<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's vigilance and punctuality effectively drive his character, creating a believable facade for his deeper motivations. His transformation from disciplined orchardist to determined investigator feels organic. However, his emotional depth could be further developed—his grief and determination are told more than shown, and his "sardonic" nature feels more stated than demonstrated through specific actions or dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects Elias's personal tragedy to his investigation and ultimate resolution. The progression from suspicion to discovery to confrontation follows a satisfying arc. However, the revelation and resolution feel somewhat rushed in the latter half, with the public demonstration and exposure happening too neatly. The peacock pattern code is intriguing but could benefit from more specific explanation of how it actually works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a unique and memorable setting that balances whimsy with mystery. The juxtaposition of this secretive establishment against rolling orchards effectively establishes atmosphere. The peacock imagery creates visual cohesion throughout. The story could benefit from more sensory details of the facility itself—sounds, smells, and physical sensations that would make the setting more immersive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock motif as both literal pattern and metaphor for hidden truths. The emotional core—a brother seeking justice—resonates, and the bittersweet resolution feels earned. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing emotional states ("sardonic facade cracking," "bittersweet triumph") rather than demonstrating these through specific actions or dialogue. The final image of peacocks wandering through blossoming trees provides a satisfying symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution contains several hallmarks of formulaic writing. The prose tends toward unnecessary complexity ("sardonic glee," "vigilant eyes now softened by closure") that feels artificial rather than authentic. Character emotions are often stated rather than demonstrated through action. The conspiracy plot follows predictable beats without surprising twists, and the resolution comes too easily. The peacock symbolism, while clever, is deployed somewhat heavy-handedly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional stakes. The peacock motif cleverly ties together the seal, the coded messages, and the final resolution. However, the writing often prioritizes flowery language over clarity, and the conspiracy plot lacks the complexity or surprise that would elevate it beyond a standard mystery. The emotional core—Elias's grief and determination—provides genuine resonance despite some execution flaws.</comment>
