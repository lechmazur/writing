<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The woodsman's character is well-developed through his grief-driven motivation. His relationship with the hairbrush reveals his emotional depth, and his actions consistently align with his established motivation to map railways as a way of processing loss. However, his "voice" lacks distinctive qualities that would elevate him beyond a somewhat generic grieving father archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the mapping of railways to the character's emotional journey, with the short-circuit serving as both literal event and metaphorical breakthrough. The story achieves a complete arc from avoidance to acceptance within the word limit. However, the connection between measuring echoes in the water tower and finding railways feels somewhat underdeveloped, leaving a logical gap in the method's execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The radio wave garden with its rusted antennas creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that mirrors the character's emotional state. The setting works exceptionally well with the themes of lost connections and forgotten paths. Sensory details like the "faint hum of static" and "rust-stained walls" immerse the reader in this liminal space where past and present converge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the railway mapping as metaphor for the character's emotional journey, creating meaningful subtext. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the revelation about his daughter. However, the story occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them, and some metaphors (like measuring echoes to find railways) remain underdeveloped, preventing the narrative from reaching its full potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, it occasionally slips into overly formal phrasing and somewhat generic emotional descriptions. The phrase "despairing cheer" feels forced rather than organic to the narrative. Some transitions between memories and present action feel abrupt, and the resolution comes too neatly, lacking the messiness of genuine human emotional processing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about grief and acceptance. The radio wave garden and abandoned railways create a compelling metaphorical landscape for exploring loss. However, some elements feel less organically integrated (particularly the echo measurement method), and the emotional resolution comes too easily for a story dealing with profound grief, diminishing its lasting impact.</comment>
