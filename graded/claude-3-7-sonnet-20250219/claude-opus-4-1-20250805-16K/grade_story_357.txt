<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret's characterization as a collector of depression metaphors is compelling and consistent. Her personification of despair as "Alpha" creates a meaningful psychological dimension. Her decisions throughout the game reveal her evolving relationship with solitude. However, some dialogue feels slightly forced rather than organically emerging from her established personality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure brilliantly transforms a Monopoly game into a metaphysical confrontation with depression. The progression from invitation to realization to rejection of the game's terms creates a satisfying arc. The story maintains coherence despite its fantastical elements, with the unraveling of truth serving as an effective plot device. The ending provides genuine resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair creates a surreal, reflective environment that perfectly embodies depression's cold isolation. The juxtaposition of mythological beings playing a mundane board game creates compelling tension. Sensory details like ice formations that "sparkle" and the phoenix's voice "crackling like expensive firewood" create a rich, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's psychological landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the Monopoly game as both literal activity and extended metaphor for depression's controlling nature. The subtext exploring how we "collect" our pain resonates deeply. The dialogue between mythological beings carries philosophical weight without becoming didactic. The final revelation that "triumph over despair meant refusing to play its rigged game" delivers both emotional catharsis and intellectual satisfaction. The core theme of reframing one's relationship with solitude emerges organically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its fantastical board game framing and personification of depression. The metaphors—particularly Alpha as predator and the black rose as bait—feel fresh and insightful. While phrases like "earnest flippancy" border on purple prose, most of the writing maintains a distinct voice. The story avoids the formulaic emotional beats common in depression narratives by focusing on agency rather than victimhood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than arbitrary. The brevity serves the narrative, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the subject matter. The mythological beings, depression metaphors, and board game setting converge to create something genuinely thought-provoking about mental health and isolation. Minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent it from reaching perfect cohesion, but the emotional impact remains strong.</comment>
