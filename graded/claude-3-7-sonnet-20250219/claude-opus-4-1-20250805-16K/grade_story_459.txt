<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's character is exceptionally well-developed through her unique profession and supernatural ability. Her motivation to understand the relationship between holding on and letting go is consistent and profoundly shapes her actions. The elegant clumsiness manifests both physically and metaphorically in her approach to the ghosts. Her interactions with Dr. Chen reveal depth without exposition. The only slight weakness is that we could use more insight into why she specifically seeks understanding through ghost tours.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves remarkable coherence within the tight word limit. The parallel between sand castles and ghosts creates a perfect thematic arc from Maya's initial discomfort with silence to her ultimate understanding of liberation. The narrative moves gracefully from problem to resolution, with the placement of the flower crown serving as a perfect climactic action. The pacing balances introspection with action, never feeling rushed despite the complex concept being explored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab functions brilliantly as both literal setting and metaphorical landscape. The juxtaposition of preserved impermanence against trapped spirits creates a rich thematic resonance. Sensory details are precise and evocative—the crackle of the dried flower crown, the mustard staining coveralls, the singing elevator cables—all contributing to the atmosphere without overwhelming the narrative. The setting directly enhances the central concept of preservation versus release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism and subtext. The extended metaphor of preservation versus release works on multiple levels—physical, emotional, and spiritual. Maya's journey culminates in a profound realization that feels earned rather than imposed. The final line delivers philosophical weight without pretension. The story skillfully shows rather than tells Maya's emotional evolution, particularly in her final interaction with the elevator and the absent ghost child.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story exhibits strong originality in its premise and execution. The sand castle preservation lab is a strikingly original setting that perfectly serves the theme. The handling of ghosts avoids typical haunting tropes in favor of a more nuanced exploration of presence and absence. Occasional moments of slightly ornate language ("elegant clumsiness with words") are the only minor stylistic issues in an otherwise fresh narrative voice. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, contributing to a unified exploration of preservation, release, and the spaces in between. The brevity enhances rather than limits the narrative, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about our attachments to both the physical and metaphysical, demonstrating remarkable thematic depth for its length.</comment>
