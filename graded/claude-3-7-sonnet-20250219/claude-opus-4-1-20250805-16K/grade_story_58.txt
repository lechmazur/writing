<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's character has clear motivation (seeking healing from trauma) and the "fiercely loyal" attribute manifests in her 12 years of service. Her trembling hands and fractured psyche provide compelling internal conflict. However, we don't get enough specific backstory about her trauma to fully invest in her journey, and her character voice lacks distinctive qualities that would make her truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively incorporates the "radicalize" action through Keene's methods of transforming the suffering into healers. The narrative flows logically from Vera seeking help to finding a community of similarly affected individuals. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, moving from isolation to connection, from brokenness toward healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a power outage creates an exceptional atmosphere that perfectly complements the theme of finding light in darkness. The moths as metaphors for transformation and the flickering city lights mirror the characters' internal states. The setting organically enables the story's central action and supports the tone of "sanctified dread" with its isolation and elevation above the troubled city.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moths as multifaceted symbols for transformation and resilience. The central conflict of internal trauma versus healing is well-established, and the theme of community healing emerges organically. The ending provides emotional resolution while suggesting ongoing growth. The interweaving of meditation techniques within comedy shows impressive craft, though some metaphors could be more subtly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific imagery and consistent tone. The metaphor of moths drawn to light feels fresh in this context of trauma and healing. The narrative does occasionally rely on telling rather than showing emotional states ("Vera felt the trembling in her hands finally still"), and some of the coded messages in the jokes feel slightly mechanical rather than organic to the character of Keene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The concept of healing through coded messages in comedy routines feels innovative, and the moth metaphor provides thematic depth. While some transitions could be smoother and certain elements more fully developed, the overall effect is a compelling story that leaves the reader with lingering thoughts about communal healing and finding light in darkness.</comment>
