<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exiled prince's characterization is subtly executed through meaningful actions and reactions rather than explicit statements. His connection to the mortar and pestle reveals his attachment to tradition amid displacement. His gesture of sharing with the stranger demonstrates growth beyond bitterness. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into his pre-exile life to better understand his transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from the snowstorm to the chance encounter to the symbolic grinding of herbs and locking of doors. There's elegant cohesion between the external conflict (storm) and internal journey (finding connection). The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office as a liminal space between borders brilliantly mirrors the prince's exiled state. Sensory details are exceptional—dust motes in fading light, ice-crusted scarves, the rhythmic sound of grinding herbs—creating a vivid atmosphere of isolation transformed into intimacy. The snow erasing the world outside perfectly externalizes the internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story masterfully employs symbolism: the worn key, the mortar grinding more than herbs, borders dissolving. The central conflict of isolation versus connection resolves with poetic elegance. The themes of transformation and unexpected healing emerge organically. While the dialogue serves its purpose well, it occasionally verges on being too thematically on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The writing shows considerable craft but occasionally lapses into somewhat expected metaphors ("like blind eyes"). The woman's immediate recognition of the mortar's significance feels slightly convenient. While the prose is generally fresh, certain phrases like "achingly familiar" and "the hollow hunger of loneliness" edge toward familiar literary constructions. The ending insight about loneliness being cured by authentic moments, while true, is delivered a bit directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story skillfully weaves all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The emotional arc feels authentic despite brevity. The symbolic layers (grinding herbs, turning keys) enrich without overwhelming. The conclusion strikes a resonant note about human connection that elevates the piece beyond a simple encounter narrative. With minor refinements to pacing and some fresher language choices, this would approach excellence.</comment>
