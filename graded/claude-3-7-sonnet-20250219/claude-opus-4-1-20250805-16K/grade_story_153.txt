<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus embodies the eternal student with exceptional clarity, his motivation to understand rather than merely achieve immortality creating a compelling philosophical tension. His detachment is well-established without becoming one-dimensional, and his realization about the paradox of his existence—that his endless pursuit of knowledge prevents him from truly understanding—provides sophisticated character depth. However, his emotional journey could be more viscerally rendered rather than intellectually described.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves with elegant precision from Marcus's established position to his revelation about the nature of immortality, with the headlamp serving as both catalyst and metaphor. The digitization process connects logically to his broader quest, and the story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints. The philosophical arc is strong, though the middle section could better dramatize his process of discovery rather than explaining it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The post-stellar apocalypse setting is exceptionally well-realized, with the underground city of evolved mole people creating a hauntingly beautiful backdrop. The impossible light in absolute darkness serves as a perfect metaphorical vehicle. Sensory details are sparse but precise, creating an atmosphere of cosmic desolation that perfectly complements the theme of persisting beyond natural endpoints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves profound impact through its exploration of immortality as both achievement and burden. The central paradox—that truly understanding reality requires surrender rather than conquest—resonates deeply. The headlamp's impossible light brilliantly symbolizes the contradiction at the heart of existence. The philosophical depth is impressive, though occasionally the telling of ideas slightly overshadows their dramatic embodiment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its cosmic timeframe and philosophical approach to immortality. The prose maintains consistent sophistication without becoming purple, and the metaphor of light in darkness feels fresh rather than formulaic. The concept of quantum scarring on the lamp shows creative invention. Some emotional nuance is sacrificed for conceptual exploration, and occasionally the academic tone borders on distancing the reader from Marcus's humanity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion across vast temporal and conceptual scales. The elements integrate seamlessly, with the headlamp's paradoxical light serving as the perfect vehicle for the story's philosophical tensions. The prose strikes an effective balance between accessibility and sophistication. The ending achieves poignancy through understatement, leaving the reader with lingering questions about the nature of immortality and understanding. Minor refinements in emotional resonance would elevate it further.</comment>
