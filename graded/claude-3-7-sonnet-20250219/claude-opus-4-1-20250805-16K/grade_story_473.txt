<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's character development is strong though not exceptional. His motivation to preserve the orchard while navigating leadership pressures is clear, and his calculated unpredictability manifests consistently in his actions. The way he uses the handshake manual as a screening tool reveals his strategic mind. However, his internal emotional journey could be more deeply explored beyond the surface statement that "burdens of leadership gnawed at him." We get his methods but less of his personal transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses pruning as both literal and metaphorical action driving the narrative. The story achieves a satisfying arc from inheritance to expansion, with clear cause-effect relationships throughout. The hidden instructions method is logically integrated. The confrontation with solar company representatives provides necessary tension and resolution. While the pacing is generally strong, the transition to autumn feels slightly rushed after the confrontation scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard beneath solar panels creates a distinctive, evocative setting that perfectly serves the story's themes of resistance and adaptation. The "perpetual twilight" atmosphere enhances both the physical challenges (trees struggling) and metaphorical significance (resistance in shadows). Sensory details like "dirt-caked fingernails" and trees "ruthlessly pruned to survive in artificial twilight" create immersive, meaningful imagery that reinforces the bittersweet tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storytelling employs rich symbolism throughout, particularly in the metaphor of pruning as both horticultural necessity and revolutionary act. The tension between corporate encroachment and grassroots resistance creates meaningful subtext. The ending effectively ties together the story's themes of defiance and growth. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in depicting Marcus's leadership through specific actions. However, dialogue is absent, which limits one potential dimension of character revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its premise and execution. The concept of coding revolutionary instructions into workshop disclaimers feels fresh and ingenious. Metaphors like "root rot" for leadership burdens and descriptions of "pruning not just branches but supply chains" are specific and purposeful rather than generic. The narrative maintains consistent tone and doesn't rely on stating emotions directly. There's no evidence of formulaic writing or AI-typical inconsistencies in the narrative flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The metaphor of pruning works brilliantly as both literal activity and thematic device. The prose balances clarity with evocative imagery, though occasionally risks becoming slightly purple. The story leaves readers with resonant questions about resistance and adaptation in hostile environments. While very strong overall, it falls just short of perfection due to some minor pacing issues and limited character interiority.</comment>
