<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sophia's intellectually dreamy nature is effectively shown through her analytical approach to folklore and the contrast between her academic background and current circumstances. Her motivation to restore the fireflies is clear and consistent with her character. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into her emotional journey before the story's events to better understand her disillusionment and subsequent determination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from disillusionment to discovery to triumphant action. The action of reinvention drives the narrative forward organically, with excellent cause-and-effect relationships between Sophia's postcard mapping and her eventual solution. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the transition from discovery to action feels slightly accelerated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The autumn setting paired with mysterious fireflies creates a richly atmospheric world. The contrast between the grimy tavern and the magical natural setting effectively mirrors Sophia's journey. Sensory details like chalk dust catching wind, golden-green light, and reflections on water create vivid imagery that enhances the story's emotional impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully weaves themes of academic knowledge versus practical wisdom, tradition versus innovation, and personal faith versus communal belief. The fireflies serve as an effective metaphor for lost dreams and renewal. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction while suggesting broader implications about how communities respond to change. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments of discovery and triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI hallmarks, with consistent characterization and authentic emotional progression. The firefly premise, while not entirely novel, is handled with enough specificity to feel fresh. Some phrasing occasionally veers toward literary convention ("bruised exhilaration," "ghost mathematics"), but these instances serve the atmospheric tone rather than appearing as flourishes for their own sake. The narrative maintains consistent voice throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The academic-turned-waitress character feels authentic rather than contrived, and her method of solving the mystery through discarded postcards creates a satisfying symmetry with her own discarded expertise. The brevity serves the story well, focusing on key moments of realization and action while implying a larger world beyond the page.</comment>
