<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed as a social media exorcist with a unique hobby of collecting shopping lists, revealing his fascination with strangers' lives. His progression from digital eraser to analog resurrectionist feels earned. However, his emotional journey lacks sufficient depthâ€”we understand his actions but don't fully feel his transformation. Receipt Woman remains somewhat two-dimensional despite her pivotal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from Marcus's collection habit to discovery of the receipt to infiltration of the secret club, culminating in his joining the analog revolution. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit. However, the revelation feels slightly rushed, and the connection between his exorcism work and being "recruited" isn't fully developed, leaving some logical gaps in how these digitally-erased people found each other.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of digital erasure against physical spaces creates a compelling atmosphere. The abandoned mess hall, music hall, and secret clubs behind laundromats are vividly rendered with sensory details like "wet concrete and whispered passwords." The world feels cohesive and purposeful, with physical spaces meaningfully contrasted against digital voids, enhancing the story's themes of presence versus absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of digital versus analog existence and the traces we leave behind. Metaphors like "tables overturned like digital profiles he'd scrubbed clean" elegantly connect the physical and digital worlds. The ending provides thoughtful resolution with the "gloriously invisible" revolution. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat intellectual rather than visceral, and some metaphors feel slightly overworked rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of "social media exorcist" and analog resurrection. However, certain phrases like "life's raw edge" and "indifferent enthusiasm" feel somewhat affected. The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Marcus's emotional state. While the premise is fresh, the execution sometimes defaults to overly formal language and abstractions that distance rather than immerse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully weaves assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about digital erasure and analog rediscovery. The concept of a "quietly loud revolution" creates memorable resonance. However, some thematic elements feel slightly overexplained rather than allowing readers to discover connections themselves. The prose occasionally prioritizes cleverness over emotional authenticity, though the overall effect remains thought-provoking and distinctive.</comment>
