<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's exorcist identity and stage fright are effectively established, with her anxiety serving as both internal conflict and character development driver. Her grandmother's influence shapes her actions convincingly. However, her transformation from trembling fear to confidence feels somewhat rushed, and we don't get enough insight into how she overcomes her stage fright beyond the successful exorcism itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with the exorcism ritual as its centerpiece, effectively using "submerge" as a pivotal action. The narrative achieves satisfying coherence from beginning to resolution despite constraints. However, the conflict resolves too easily—the demon is dispatched without sufficient struggle, making the stakes feel artificially low despite the cosmic setting and personal confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orbital debris field is brilliantly utilized, creating a haunting liminal space perfect for supernatural encounters. The contrast between mechanical toys and organic wildflowers creates meaningful tension. Sensory details like starlight catching on the exorcist's collar and the echo of a phantom key establish an atmospheric blend of cosmic isolation and spectral intimacy that perfectly supports the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the wildflowers as both literal objects and powerful symbols connecting humanity to Earth, creating layered meaning. The theme of inherited knowledge versus inherited fear resonates emotionally. While dialogue is minimal, it serves its purpose well. The central conflict between truth and protective lies creates compelling tension, though the resolution feels somewhat too neat for the existential stakes established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the space-exorcism concept feels fresh, certain aspects fall into predictable patterns—particularly the demon taking the grandmother's form and being defeated relatively easily. The prose occasionally becomes ornate ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") in ways that feel artificial rather than authentic to character. The emotional progression follows somewhat algorithmic beats rather than the messy reality of human psychology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an evocative setting and conceptual depth. The pressed wildflowers work brilliantly as both physical objects and metaphorical connections to Earth. However, the too-neat resolution and occasional lapses into purple prose prevent it from achieving its full potential. The concept is stronger than its execution, though it remains compelling.</comment>
