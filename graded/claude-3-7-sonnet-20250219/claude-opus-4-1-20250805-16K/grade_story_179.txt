<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's character is well-developed through his internal conflict between duty and empathy. His use of the fingerprint microscope effectively reveals his coping mechanism and worldview. His forcibly gentle authority and the way he transforms his own envy into helping the children shows meaningful character depth. However, his backstory feels somewhat underdeveloped, and we could use more insight into how his 17 years in this role has shaped him beyond his current struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Elena's homesickness to the discovery of fingerprint patterns resembling bee dances to community integration. The mobilization of this knowledge forms a clear narrative arc. However, the significant breakthrough—that human fingerprints echo bee communication patterns—feels slightly rushed in its development and consequences, relying on coincidence rather than established world-building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The beehive setting is richly realized with amber-filtered light, honeycomb walls, and the integration of human-bee cohabitation. The post-Pollination Crisis timeframe provides excellent context. Sensory details effectively convey the alien yet familiar environment, and the hive serves as both physical setting and metaphor for collective identity versus individuality—a perfect thematic backdrop for the story's concerns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story skillfully explores themes of adaptation, belonging, and the transformation of longing. The fingerprint-as-map metaphor works beautifully, creating meaningful symbolism that carries the narrative. The final image of "sorrow fermented into honey" offers a poignant, lingering conclusion. However, the Queen's appearance feels somewhat convenient rather than earned, and some emotional transitions could be more fully developed rather than stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution. The beehive integration concept feels fresh, and the fingerprint-bee dance connection is inventive. Language is generally purposeful with effective metaphors like "their prints swirled like galaxies." However, some emotional descriptions ("jubilant remorse," "terrible joy") feel slightly forced, and the ending relies on telling rather than showing the community's transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that explores profound themes of adaptation and belonging. The fingerprint microscope method ingeniously connects to the beehive setting and the characters' emotional journeys. While some transitions feel rushed due to the word constraint, the story achieves a satisfying emotional arc and leaves the reader with the lingering question of what constitutes true belonging—whether adaptation is liberation or surrender.</comment>
