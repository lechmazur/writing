<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dr. Mira Chen is well-developed through specific details that reveal character: her inherited baseball cap, her specialized necromancy skills, and her methodical approach to her work. Her motivation to map caves for humanity's survival is clear and consistent. However, we don't see enough emotional depth or internal conflict to make her truly memorable, and her "voice" remains somewhat clinical rather than distinctive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects the necromancer's unique abilities to her mission of mapping caves with ghostly assistance. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from introduction to discovery to future implications. However, the action of "dominating" the ghostly voices feels somewhat underdeveloped, and the pacing occasionally prioritizes worldbuilding over advancing the central conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is exceptionally well-realized through specific sensory details like "phosphorescent glow" and formations "like frozen lightning." The fusion of futuristic technology with ancient necromancy creates a compelling atmosphere, and the buried cinema complex adds an unexpected dimension that enriches the worldbuilding. The post-collapse future timeframe integrates seamlessly with the nostalgic elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story effectively employs the metaphor of film preservation as parallel to memory preservation, creating thematic resonance. The concept of using the dead as guides to save the living offers thought-provoking subtext. However, the conflict remains somewhat abstract rather than immediate, and the story occasionally tells rather than shows the emotional stakes of Mira's work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fusion of necromancy with geological survey work demonstrates genuine originality, and the spirits communicating through film references provides a fresh approach to ghost stories. The language avoids purple prose while maintaining vivid imagery. However, some descriptions like "the Great Collapse" feel somewhat generic for post-apocalyptic fiction, and the characterization occasionally relies on stated attributes rather than demonstrated traits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels both speculative and grounded. The blend of necromancy, technology, geology, and cinema creates a distinctive narrative framework. The ending effectively points toward future mysteries while providing sufficient closure. Despite occasional moments where worldbuilding overshadows character development, the story leaves a lingering impression of humanity finding connection across the boundary of death.</comment>
