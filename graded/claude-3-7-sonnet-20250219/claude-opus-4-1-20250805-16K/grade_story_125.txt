<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus is well-characterized through his relationship with his "exceptionally usual" magic, creating a believable underachieving mage whose frustration and self-doubt are palpable. His motivation to understand his limitations feels authentic, though his emotional journey from resignation to excitement could use more nuance. The revelation about his heritage provides meaningful character development, but happens too quickly for full impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure creates a satisfying arc from problem to revelation within the tight word count. The misdelivered packages drive the narrative forward organically, and the unveiling of Marcus's true heritage provides effective resolution. However, the transition from discovery to understanding happens too abruptly, and the doll head's exposition feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through character action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of rural farmland with crashed space technology creates an immediately compelling atmosphere. The setting brilliantly mirrors the character's divided heritage and creates natural tension. The control room coming to life with starlight provides a vivid sensory payoff. The world-building efficiently establishes a society where terrestrial magic and stellar manipulation coexist without excessive exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the contrast between earth and stars as both literal setting and metaphor for self-discovery. The central theme of misunderstood potential resonates emotionally. The ending creates a satisfying sense of possibility rather than finality. However, the revelation relies too heavily on exposition from the doll rather than allowing Marcus to make discoveries through action, weakening the emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of terrestrial versus stellar magic offers genuine originality. The narrative avoids most AI-typical patterns, with consistent tone and character voice. However, the exposition-heavy revelation through the doll head feels somewhat mechanical, and the emotional beats could be more nuanced. The writing occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states ("a sound caught between frustration and relief") rather than letting readers experience them through specific details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements cohesively, particularly in how the magic system, setting, and heritage concept reinforce each other. The brevity works to create a snapshot of transformation rather than feeling constrained. While the exposition through the doll head feels slightly forced, the overall narrative maintains a satisfying balance between fantastical elements and emotional resonance. The central metaphor of misunderstood magic as misunderstood heritage provides meaningful depth.</comment>
