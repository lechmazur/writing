<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is well-established as a dedicated railway mapper whose life's work is upended. His relationship with his grandmother provides emotional depth, and his reaction to discovering his life's deception is nuanced - bitter yet determined. His character transitions believably from dedicated historian to reluctant truth-seeker. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into his internal processing of this massive revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's life's work to his grandmother's deathbed revelation, creating a compelling mystery. The short-circuiting scanner serves as both literal and metaphorical catalyst for truth. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, moving from deception to revelation to acceptance with clear causality. The story feels complete yet open-ended in a satisfying way that suggests larger implications beyond the text.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is exceptionally realized through vivid sensory details - electromagnetic tendrils, aurora patterns, frequencies that make teeth ache. The juxtaposition of natural imagery with technological elements creates a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. The setting becomes a character itself, with the abandoned junction and water tower serving as perfect vessels for the story's themes of hidden truths and technological mystery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story masterfully employs metaphor throughout - railways as deception, electromagnetic fields as hidden knowledge, the hairbrush as both connection to the past and tool for discovery. The central conflict of truth versus deception resonates emotionally, while the ending achieves a delicate balance between resolution and mystery. The theme of inherited secrets and personal legacy adds significant depth to what could have been merely a science fiction concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates consistent stylistic control with fresh, specific metaphors ("metal rails twisting skyward like metal prayers") and avoids formulaic phrasing. The handling of the electromagnetic phenomena feels original rather than derivative of common sci-fi tropes. The emotional evolution feels authentically human rather than following predictable patterns. The concept of radio wave gardens sprouting from railway junctions shows particular creative ingenuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite its complex elements, weaving them together to create a narrative that feels intentionally designed rather than constrained. The grandmother's hairbrush, the railway mapping, and the electromagnetic phenomena all serve the central theme of hidden truths. The brevity feels like a strength, allowing the mystery to linger effectively. The story leaves readers with meaningful questions about legacy, deception, and the nature of truth.</comment>
