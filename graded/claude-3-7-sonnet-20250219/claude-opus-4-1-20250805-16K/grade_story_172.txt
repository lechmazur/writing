<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina is effectively portrayed as an unsettled guide with clear motivation to escape her prophesied role. Her reluctant acceptance of destiny creates a compelling character arc. However, her backstory remains somewhat vague, and her emotional journey, while present, could benefit from more specific personal stakes rather than abstract metaphysical concerns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the alignment action to drive the narrative forward, creating a clear transformation arc as Marina moves from resistance to acceptance. The connection between the hallway photo and seashell discovery is established but somewhat tenuous. While the story achieves a satisfying conclusion within its constraints, the precise nature of the prophecy and what's at stake remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The giant seashell setting is exceptionally well-realized, with its mother-of-pearl interior and mathematical equations creating a vivid, otherworldly atmosphere. The transformation of the shell into something "much larger, much older" effectively supports the story's metaphysical themes. The sensory details of acoustic resonance and "teeth ache" ground the fantastical elements in physical sensation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its elegant metaphors ("architectural secrets weren't just about buildings, but about the bones of reality itself") and the compelling theme of accepting rather than fleeing destiny. The narrative successfully creates tension between professional detachment and personal involvement. While the "reversed wishes" concept is intriguing, its mechanics could be clearer to strengthen the story's internal logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of architectural secrets as reality-altering forces and the unusual mechanism of "unwishing." However, phrases like "architectural secrets bloomed around her like frozen fireworks" and "heroes never look back" veer into familiar territory. The writing maintains a consistent tone throughout, avoiding the telltale shifts of AI-generated content, but occasionally relies on abstract description rather than specific sensory detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates multiple complex elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinct voice and atmosphere. The blend of architectural mystery, prophecy, and personal transformation works well within the word count. While the concepts are ambitious, occasionally the abstract nature of the threat and transformation limits emotional investment. The ending effectively resolves Marina's character arc without overexplaining the metaphysical elements.</comment>
