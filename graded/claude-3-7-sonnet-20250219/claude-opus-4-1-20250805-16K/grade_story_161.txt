<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's character is well-developed through his punctuality contrasted with grief-driven determination. His methodical investigation and orchardist background logically connect to his ability to recognize patterns. His motivation—avenging his daughter—drives every action coherently. However, his character could benefit from more nuanced emotional complexity beyond the revenge archetype, and his dialogue occasionally feels more expository than authentic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively integrates the paper airplane testing with the conspiracy, creating a coherent narrative from discovery to confrontation. The arc is complete within the word limit, with logical cause-effect relationships. The peacock pattern revelation provides a satisfying climax. The only weakness is that the resolution feels slightly rushed, with the FBI's timely arrival and immediate arrest seeming too convenient for the tight narrative structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a distinctive atmosphere that perfectly serves the story's conspiratorial tone. The clinical setting contrasts effectively with Marcus's emotional motivations. The morning timeframe reinforces his punctuality trait while connecting to his daughter's death. The world-building efficiently establishes corporate agricultural villainy without excessive exposition. Some additional sensory details of the facility itself would have strengthened the immersive quality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the paper airplane as both literal plot device and metaphor for truth taking flight. The emotional core—parental grief transformed into methodical vengeance—resonates powerfully. The peacock pattern symbolism cleverly connects agricultural devastation with beauty, suggesting corporate evil masquerading as progress. The final image of folding a dove creates poignant closure. While the narrative achieves emotional impact, some dialogue feels slightly mechanical rather than organic to the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls but contains moments of overly explanatory dialogue and convenient plot resolution. The conspiracy narrative, while competently executed, follows predictable beats. Phrases like "voice dripping with dark satisfaction" and "crumpled like badly folded origami" lean toward purple prose. The corporate villain feels somewhat one-dimensional. However, the peacock pattern discovery and the paper airplane metaphor show creative originality in combining the required elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its required elements into a cohesive revenge narrative with emotional weight. The paper airplane/peacock pattern connection is particularly ingenious. The brevity works well for the revelation-confrontation structure. While the corporate conspiracy framework isn't groundbreaking, the execution is compelling and the emotional core authentic. The story leaves a satisfying impression of justice achieved at great personal cost, with the dove folding providing a memorable final image.</comment>
