<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's character as a swindler with a conscience is established effectively through his calculated movements and inner conflict. His relationship with the ghostly programmers adds depth to his motivation. However, the quick transition from con artist to truth-teller feels somewhat rushed, and we could benefit from more insight into his personal stakes in this revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative flows logically from setup to confrontation to resolution with effective cause-and-effect relationships. The book dropping as catalyst works particularly well, though the rapid shift from Marcus's intended con to confession happens with minimal resistance, somewhat undermining the tension. The story achieves completeness within its constraints but would benefit from a more nuanced climactic moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic vertical farmland setting is exceptionally vivid and meaningfully integrated. The juxtaposition of natural growth amid technological ruins creates a powerful metaphorical landscape that reinforces the theme. Sensory details like "skeletal remains of the forty-second floor" and the image of nature reclaiming corporate spaces effectively establish both physical space and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension through its supernatural elements and revelation structure. The ghosts as silent witnesses to corporate malfeasance creates compelling subtext about accountability and truth. The writing shows restraint with literary devices that serve the narrative rather than overwhelm it. The ending delivers emotional impact, though it resolves slightly too neatly given the stakes established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI writing hallmarks with its consistent tone and specific imagery. The concept of programmer ghosts communicating through environmental manipulation is original. However, Chen's immediate acceptance of Marcus's revelation feels somewhat implausibleâ€”a more nuanced reaction would add authenticity. The "vertical farmland" setting shows creative imagination without relying on common post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth about corporate accountability, truth, and redemption. The supernatural elements enhance rather than distract from the human story at its core. While the ending arrives somewhat abruptly and could benefit from more complexity in Chen's reaction, the overall effect is memorable and thought-provoking, with imagery that lingers beyond the immediate reading.</comment>
