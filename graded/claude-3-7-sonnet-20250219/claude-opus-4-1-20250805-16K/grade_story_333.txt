<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization as a "sincere rebel" is well-established and consistent, with her professional identity as a preservation architect reinforcing her motivation. Her actions align with her established traits, particularly her determination to document and preserve architectural innovations. However, her emotional depth remains somewhat surface-level, and her dialogue-free portrayal limits our access to her distinct voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Maya's theorizing about the passage's architecture with her discovery of its mathematical innovations. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc despite the word constraint, moving from mystery to revelation to resolution. The connection between the grandmother's note and Maya's discovery creates coherence, though the transition from investigation to understanding could be more explicitly developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage setting is vividly realized through sensory details like "feeling centuries of limestone shift beneath her fingertips like breathing stone." The atmosphere of ancient knowledge preserved in stone powerfully complements the core concept of architectural preservation. The timeframe between storms creates natural tension and purpose, while the monastery setting perfectly frames the conflict between tradition and development.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively employs the metaphor of "breathing stone" and creates meaningful subtext about innovation surviving persecution. The inheritance theme resonates emotionally, connecting past and present rebels through architectural knowledge. While the conflict between preservation and development is clear, the stakes could be heightened for greater impact. The story successfully "shows" Maya's connection to history through her physical interaction with the walls rather than merely telling us.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept is fresh, some phrasing feels unnecessarily ornate ("bitterness had braided itself through every word"). The story avoids major AI hallmarks like logical inconsistencies or abrupt topic shifts, but occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The "walls solving themselves" concept is original, though the broader narrative of preserving tradition against modernity follows familiar patterns. The writing demonstrates individual style but would benefit from more restraint in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about architectural preservation and innovation. The constantly changing walls, torn sticky note, and timeframe between storms feel particularly integral rather than forced. The brevity works well for this focused discovery narrative, though some emotional nuances could be more developed. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about Maya's next steps in preservation, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
