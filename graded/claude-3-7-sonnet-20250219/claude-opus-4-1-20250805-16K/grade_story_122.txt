<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kestra is effectively characterized through her "patiently frantic" attribute, which manifests in her measured breaths amid internal chaos. Her cyber-templar identity creates compelling tension with her physical reality. Her motivation to honor her grandfather while bridging digital and physical realms is clear. However, the character would benefit from more exploration of her internal conflict between digital omnipotence and human vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Kestra's arrival at the burial site to her successful manipulation of the storm, with her "proving" action driving the narrative forward. The prism method logically connects to her cyber abilities. While the cause-effect relationships are clear, the story occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic language. The resolution feels earned but some middle transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Tibetan sky burial setting is exceptionally well-integrated with both the action and the character's journey. Rich sensory details—circling vultures, storm clouds, lightning, and corpse-flesh—create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the collision between digital and natural worlds. The timeframe during the reading from the Book of the Dead adds spiritual gravity that complements the "mirage of safety" concept perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the prism as both literal tool and metaphor for Kestra's transformation. The writing creates powerful imagery through phrases like "splitting white death into a rainbow" and "digital prayers mixing with sky burial smoke." The theme of finding strength in vulnerability is well-developed. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction while maintaining the story's mystical quality. Some sentences are overly complex, occasionally obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of cyberpunk elements with Tibetan funeral rites. The prose avoids AI-typical patterns with emotionally nuanced phrases like "euphoric certainty" and "patient frenzy." Some metaphors feel fresh ("taught lightning to fear itself"). However, occasional ornate constructions ("devastatingly true") veer toward purple prose, and certain sections prioritize poetic rhythm over clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores the intersection of technology and spirituality. The bridle with its hidden prism serves as an elegant bridge between elements. The brevity works to create a focused, intense experience. While occasionally prioritizing lyrical language over clarity, the story leaves readers with a resonant meditation on vulnerability as strength and the illusory nature of safety across both digital and physical realms.</comment>
