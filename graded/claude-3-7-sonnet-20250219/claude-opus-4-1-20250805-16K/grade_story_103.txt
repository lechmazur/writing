<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The weatherbeaten knight has clear, consistent motivation throughout—her regret over choosing duty over her daughter. Her character development is compelling as she moves from seeing duty and love as opposing forces to understanding them as "reflections of the same devotion." The "grudgingly sweet" attribute manifests naturally in both her reflection's smile and her daughter's forgiveness. Her voice carries authentic weight of experience, though her epiphany feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc within the word constraint, with the brass door knocker serving as both catalyst and symbol. The pattern of seven doors creates coherent backstory efficiently. The story achieves satisfying resolution through the knight's realization and transformation. However, the final transformation from physical prison to "open sky" feels somewhat abrupt and metaphysically unclear—the mechanics of this world shift could be more precisely established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting brilliantly embodies both isolation and potential salvation. Its position on jagged reefs that claimed the daughter's ship creates perfect thematic resonance. The brass door knocker's reflective quality allows for the timeframe element to function organically. Sensory details like "voice cracking like leather left in salt spray" and stones "singing with released sorrow" create palpable atmosphere that supports the emotional journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable emotional impact through its exploration of regret, forgiveness, and integration. The brass knocker functions as powerful metaphor for reflection and connection between worlds. The theme of impossible choices transcends into profound insight about false dichotomies. The ending delivers meaningful catharsis. However, the philosophical revelation about separation being illusory feels slightly underdeveloped within the available space—it emerges somewhat suddenly rather than building throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its treatment of the reflective doorway and time-folding concept. The writing largely avoids clichés and formulaic phrasing. The metaphor of reflection works throughout multiple levels (literal/figurative). However, phrases like "joyful agony of memories" and "complete at last" edge toward predictable emotional language. The story's philosophical turn, while effective, employs somewhat familiar spiritual concepts about integration and false separation that could benefit from more distinctive framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive, meaningful narrative. The knight's emotional journey feels genuine despite the fantastical elements. The brass knocker serves as both plot device and thematic vehicle. While occasionally brushing against familiar fantasy tropes, the story maintains a distinct voice and leaves the reader with resonant questions about choices, regret, and integration. The primary constraint is that the philosophical revelation feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>
