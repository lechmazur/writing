<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's shyness is effectively shown through her "practiced indifference" and "detached precision" rather than merely stated. Her character as a diviner who avoids crowds yet holds "the attention of infinite timelines" creates compelling tension. Her motivation to restore cosmic balance despite personal cost is clear and consistent. However, her emotional journey could be more deeply explored beyond the somewhat abstract "echo of regret" she experiences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a complete arc with exceptional economy—beginning with discovery, progressing through understanding, and concluding with resolution. The precipitate action drives the plot forward naturally as both discovery and solution. The story maintains logical cause-effect relationships throughout, connecting the social media anomalies to timeline manipulation and Mira's ritual. The progression from investigation to sacrifice creates meaningful tension within the tight word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater city market is vividly rendered through precise sensory details—"barnacle-crusted vendor table," "coral-eaten counter," and photographs suspended "in the underwater current." The setting perfectly embodies the concept of regret and lost possibilities. The parallel timelines create a rich atmospheric tension between what is and what could have been. The drowned marketplace becomes a powerful metaphor for the moral weight of Mira's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of sacrifice and cosmic responsibility. The imagery of photographs as "windows to what was, is, or could have been" and the metaphor of timeline bleeding "like light through cracked glass" demonstrate sophisticated craft. The central conflict between personal compassion and universal order creates genuine tension. The ending lands with poignant restraint—Mira leaves "knowing she'd traded their peace for the universe's stability."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of modern social media with cosmic timeline manipulation. The prose maintains consistency without relying on clichés or formulaic transitions. Emotions are shown through action rather than stated directly. The concept of "timeline-shopping" feels fresh, and the narrative avoids predictable patterns. Some phrases like "passionate disinterest" and "shy mind" feel slightly forced, but overall the writing demonstrates authentic style and vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds in integrating all assigned elements organically while maintaining thematic coherence. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each element serving the central theme of cosmic balance and personal sacrifice. The narrative achieves depth through its exploration of ethical complexity—restoring order means condemning children to death. This moral ambiguity creates resonance beyond the immediate narrative, leaving readers with questions about the cost of cosmic order.</comment>
