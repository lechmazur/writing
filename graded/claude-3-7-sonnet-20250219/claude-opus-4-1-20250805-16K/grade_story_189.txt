<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is effectively characterized through her literal approach to star maps and unwavering focus amid supernatural phenomena. Her motivation (solving water scarcity) is clear and compelling. However, we get limited insight into her background or emotional depth beyond her determination. The "bright-eyed apprentice" descriptor feels somewhat generic despite her innovative thinking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot forms a tight arc around Mira's discovery and implementation of the interstellar beacon. The overcharging action drives the climax perfectly, and the parsing of notes creates a logical progression toward the resolution. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships and purposeful pacing that builds to the transmission moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding creates a post-apocalyptic setting with haunting specificity. The lighthouse basement's isolation, ghostly inhabitants, and connection to water create a rich atmosphere that enhances the story's themes. Sensory details (blue electricity, scent of ocean) are sparse but precisely deployed. The post-water war timeframe perfectly complements the desperate quest and haunted setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story creates powerful thematic resonance around extinction, hope, and human ingenuity. The ghosts' assistance provides a poignant layer suggesting humanity's collective knowledge persisting beyond death. The ending delivers emotional impact through its understated hope. While dialogue is absent, the narrative voice maintains a compelling tension between scientific precision and poetic imagery. The water-bearer constellation provides elegant symbolism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its fusion of post-apocalyptic and supernatural elements with astronomical science. The lighthouse setting avoids clich√© through its repurposing as a laboratory. The prose maintains consistent tone without purple flourishes. Some phrases ("bright-eyed apprentice," "ghosts helped, surprisingly") feel slightly generic, but overall the narrative voice remains distinct and the concept feels fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, making them feel essential rather than forced. The phone booth key's repurposing as a conductor brilliantly connects obsolete technology to potential salvation. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining. The lingering question of whether contact with water-rich worlds will succeed creates meaningful resonance beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
