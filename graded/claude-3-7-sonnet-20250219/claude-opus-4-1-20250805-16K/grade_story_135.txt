<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kira's characterization as an ambitious brewer with fierce loyalty to preserving languages through taste is consistently portrayed. Her motivation to document dying dialects drives her actions throughout. However, her emotional depth could be further developed—we understand what she does but less about her inner conflicts or growth beyond validation of her beliefs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the deciphering of bruises on the carnival poster to propel Kira's journey. The narrative arc is well-constructed with clear setup, journey, and resolution. The action of withstanding the Silence Storms creates meaningful tension. The story achieves impressive coherence within its constraints, connecting Kira's initial faith to her ultimate vindication when finding the carnival folk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen harbor with mechanical caravans creates a richly imagined setting that perfectly complements the themes of preservation and transformation. Exceptional sensory details bring this world to life—the clinking of metal against glass, voices like "aged honey-wine," and air that "turns solid." The Silence Storms and ice that sings represent masterful integration of setting with the linguistic preservation concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of language preservation as a tangible, sensory experience. The metaphor of languages transforming "like grain becoming beer" offers profound thematic depth. The central conflict between institutional abandonment and personal dedication resolves satisfyingly. The narrative skillfully "shows" Kira's determination through her actions rather than merely telling us about it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of "brewing languages" and "grip-language" show creative originality, some phrasing feels slightly ornate ("their words tasting of cinnamon and star-anise"). The central metaphor of language as fermentation is fresh, but occasionally the writing relies on somewhat predictable sensory descriptions. The story maintains consistent tone but could benefit from more nuanced emotional rendering beyond Kira's singular determination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The concept of preserving languages through brewing provides a unifying framework that makes disparate elements feel natural together. The linguistic preservation theme offers depth beyond the surface narrative. What prevents a higher score is the occasional reliance on telling rather than showing and some moments where the prose becomes slightly overwrought.</comment>
