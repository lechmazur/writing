<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's character demonstrates a compelling integration of personal heritage and mysterious destiny. Her connection to ancestral traditions manifests through physical movement, showing rather than telling her development. The unseen observer, while enigmatic, provides effective counterpoint and motivation. However, Marina lacks some psychological depth—we understand her role more than her inner conflicts or personal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves with exceptional coherence from setup to climactic moment. The ritual dance building to Marina's decisive action of flinging the whistle creates a satisfying turning point. The cause-effect relationship between Marina's actions and the whale's response feels both surprising and inevitable. Despite the compact format, the story achieves completeness without rushing, though the resolution feels slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting achieves remarkable atmospheric density through precise sensory details—"warped floorboards," "air thick with salt memory," "portraits whose eyes seemed to track her." The integration of maritime history with supernatural elements creates a liminal space perfectly suited to the story's themes. The connection between setting and action feels organic rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism throughout, particularly in equating dance movements with lighthouse beams and communication with nature. The theme of inherited wisdom embodied in physical ritual rather than text creates genuine emotional resonance. The final image of fishing boats drawn by instinct they "couldn't name but trusted completely" effectively crystallizes the story's exploration of intuitive knowledge. Some dialogue would have added dimension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, occasional phrases like "brazen calm" and "wisdom often wears the disguise of simple things" veer toward aphoristic language. The core concept demonstrates originality in connecting ballet to maritime tradition, but some descriptions ("magnificent," "churning waters") rely on somewhat expected adjectives. The story shows creative vision but occasionally falls into predictable rhythms in its concluding passages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive cohesion despite its numerous required elements, integrating them into a unified narrative rather than a checklist. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining. The blend of maritime folklore with supernatural elements creates a distinctive atmosphere. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of the observer and Marina's future, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. A few moments of overwritten prose prevent a higher score.</comment>
