<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Captain Marlow's character is well-developed through her principled stance against transporting "undesirables." Her motivation remains consistent throughout, and her dialogue with Hayes reveals moral conviction. However, her emotional depth could be further explored beyond her defiance, and some aspects of her character feel somewhat abstract rather than intimately personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Captain Marlow's imprisonment, escape, and confrontation with Hayes in a coherent arc. The mirror maze serves as both literal and metaphorical landscape for the conflict. However, the resolution feels somewhat abstract rather than concrete, and the narrative occasionally prioritizes thematic statements over advancing plot action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mirror maze creates a compelling atmosphere that brilliantly enhances the themes of multiplicity and reflection. The juxtaposition of the abandoned amusement park with the serious political undertones creates an effective dissonance. Sensory details like the calliope music and visual multiplicity of reflections immerse the reader in this unique setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the mirror maze as a central metaphor for amplification of resistance and multiple perspectives. The dialogue between Marlow and Hayes efficiently establishes the moral conflict. However, some of the thematic elements feel slightly heavy-handed rather than emerging organically from the narrative, and the cosmic echoes device occasionally reads as convenient rather than fully integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls with its consistent tone and focused narrative. The mirror maze concept is handled with originality, and the language generally avoids purple prose. However, certain phrases like "calculated wilderness" and "deliberately accidental" feel somewhat artificially inserted, and the cosmic echoes mechanism, while interesting, lacks sufficient grounding in the story's logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with clear thematic purpose. The mirror maze setting brilliantly amplifies the themes of resistance and multiplication of defiance. However, the cosmic echoes device feels somewhat underdeveloped mechanically, and certain thematic statements could be more subtly woven into the narrative rather than explicitly stated.</comment>
