<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is established immediately and maintained throughout. Her motivation to learn traditional methods drives the story coherently. The ghost keeper is also well-rendered with his tragic backstory informing his actions. Their interaction reveals layers to both characters, though the sentinel's backstory feels slightly rushed rather than organically revealed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from the crossing of the final name to the dance as knowledge transmission to the resolution at dawn. The confiscation of guilt and knowledge creates a meaningful arc within the tight constraints. The causal relationships are clear, and the ghost's fading as knowledge transfers creates a satisfying resolution. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric and perfectly supports the story's themes of duty, isolation, and passing traditions. Sensory details like "voice sounded like wind through broken glass" and "cramped bedroom" effectively immerse the reader. The lighthouse symbolically bridges past and present, living and dead, creating a potent backdrop for the narrative's exploration of duty and redemption.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of duty, guilt, and the passing of tradition through compelling symbolism (the frayed rope, the crossed-off names). The narrative shows rather than tells emotional states, and creates genuine tension around whether knowledge will be transferred before dawn. The dance as metaphor for passing tradition works brilliantly. The ending provides thematic resolution while avoiding sentimentality. However, a few phrases ("reckless precision") feel slightly overused.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific, purposeful imagery and consistent characterization. However, some phrases like "reckless precision" are repeated, and certain metaphors ("like old blood") feel somewhat predictable. The narrative voice maintains consistency throughout, and the emotional progression feels genuine rather than stated. The handling of the supernatural element avoids clich√©, presenting a fresh approach to ghost stories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The lighthouse setting, ghost, and dance method work in harmony to create a meditation on duty and knowledge transfer. The brevity feels appropriate rather than limiting, allowing just enough space to develop the central relationship and theme. The lingering impression of traditions preserved gives the piece resonance beyond its word count.</comment>
