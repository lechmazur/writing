<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Markov's character is well-developed through his centuries-long experience and the physical manifestation of his work ("fingers, rigidly flexible from centuries of pruning"). His motivation to restore Chen's work is clear and consistent with his dedication to authenticity. His bitterness evolves believably into genuine joy when restoration begins. The character could benefit from more personal stakes beyond professional loyalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally coherent, with the ink spill discovery leading logically to the launch sequence and restoration. The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, from discovery to resistance to resolution. The pacing manages to convey centuries of history while focusing on the pivotal moment of action without feeling rushed. The causal relationships between the Committee's actions, Markov's discovery, and the restoration are clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is brilliantly realized with specific, evocative details ("quantum fruit trees bloom and decay in microsecond cycles," "crystalline groves," "butterflies made of living light"). The setting perfectly serves the story's themes of preservation versus erasure. The juxtaposition of quantum-level phenomena with organic gardening imagery creates a unique atmosphere that enhances both the scientific and emotional elements of the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered metaphors about historical erasure and preservation. The central conflict between ordered control and natural chaos creates meaningful tension. The writing demonstrates sophisticated "showing" through Markov's physical reactions and the environment's response. The parallel between Markov's adaptation and the garden's design creates thematic resonance. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction while maintaining intellectual engagement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its quantum gardening concept and avoids common sci-fi tropes about immortality and resistance. The "rigidly flexible" paradox is handled with nuance rather than contradiction. Some phrases ("harsh and knowing") verge on telling rather than showing. The writing maintains consistent tone and perspective throughout. The emotional progression from bitterness to genuine joy feels earned rather than formulaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story integrates its required elements with exceptional coherence, making them feel essential rather than imposed. The quantum garden setting provides both scientific intrigue and emotional resonance. The story achieves surprising depth within its constraints, exploring themes of historical erasure, resistance, and ecological preservation. The layered meanings (literal garden restoration and metaphorical historical recovery) demonstrate sophisticated storytelling. Minor issues with exposition prevent it from scoring higher.</comment>
