<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kira's character as an introverted empath is thoughtfully established. Her empathic abilities meaningfully drive the plot and her introverted nature logically connects to her comfort with the asteroid's consciousness. However, her personal stakes and deeper character dimensions remain somewhat underdeveloped beyond her functional role in the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reassembly of the marionette creates a compelling central action that drives the narrative forward with clear purpose. The plot moves logically from discovery to understanding to communion, with the fragments serving as both literal and metaphorical connections. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though the initial setup could be more efficiently established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere blending cosmic vastness with intimate connection. The abandoned pirate hideout on an asteroid provides both physical and metaphysical dimensions that enhance the central themes. Sensory details like "drowsily buzzing" empathic senses and the marionette's "unhurried cadence of erosion" create a distinctive and immersive environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of communication across vastly different forms of consciousness and the limitations of human perception. Strong metaphorical connections between Earth's dead oceans, ancient mountains, and cosmic patience create resonant subtext. The ending achieves poignancy through the mutual recognition between human and asteroid, though some passages rely too heavily on abstract description rather than concrete action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the core concept is imaginative, the prose occasionally becomes overwrought ("the outcasts of reason," "cosmic patience"). Some metaphors feel slightly generic ("flickered like bioluminescent plankton"). The story contains moments of genuine originality in its conceptualization of the asteroid consciousness, but the execution occasionally slips into predictable patterns of mystical revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the constraint of incorporation. The central concept of communication between vastly different forms of consciousness provides thematic unity. Though occasionally veering into overwritten territory, the story creates a distinctive atmosphere and leaves the reader with lingering questions about perception, patience, and understanding across profound differences.</comment>
