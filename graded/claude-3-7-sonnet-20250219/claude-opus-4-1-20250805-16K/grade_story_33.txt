<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's character is unusually well-developed within this constraint. Her motivations are clear and consistent - she's principled and refuses to allow her research to be weaponized. The porcelain mask serves as an effective external manifestation of her internal state. Her "anxiously relaxed" attribute manifests organically in her measured, deliberate response. The character possesses psychological depth, though her "voice" could be more distinctive in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from setup to climax within the tight constraints. The narrative achieves a complete arc: Mara's dilemma, her choice, and her transformation. The concept of nonviolence shapes the plot decisively as she chooses creation over destruction. The cause-effect relationships are logical. However, the "cosmic blink" timeframe feels somewhat underdeveloped, and the pacing is slightly compressed at the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The leaf classification office setting is rendered with exceptional sensory detail and atmosphere. The fluorescent lighting, marble floors, and filing cabinets create a sterile bureaucracy that perfectly contrasts with Mara's rebellion. The setting and the birdwatcher character connect meaningfully through the research data. The ghostlike reflections create a dreamlike quality that enhances the cosmic theme. The atmosphere of controlled institutional power versus individual choice is palpable throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable thematic depth, exploring power, resistance, and transformation through well-crafted metaphors and imagery. The porcelain mask, falling "like snow," and data becoming "migration songs" are particularly effective. The ending resonates emotionally and philosophically. The central conflict between institutional power and personal ethics is clear and resolved with subtlety. The story successfully "shows" rather than "tells" through vivid imagery and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its premise and execution. The metaphors are fresh and specific to the narrative context. Some phrasing occasionally veers toward the ornate ("peaceful wildfire," "cosmic chaos was her birthright"), but generally serves the story's themes. The emotional core feels authentic rather than stated. The handling of the birdwatcher character avoids clichés. The consistent tone and unusual premise suggest a unique authorial voice rather than formulaic writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive cohesion despite incorporating multiple assigned elements. These elements feel organic to the narrative rather than forced. The brevity serves the story's meditative quality. The writing demonstrates creative thinking in how the elements interconnect—particularly the relationship between birds, leaves, and data. The ending leaves readers with lingering questions about peaceful resistance and individual choice. Minor overwriting in places prevents a higher score.</comment>
