<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed with a compelling backstory, clear motivation, and consistent characterization. His brooding nature is effectively conveyed through his relationship with art and rebellion. The reading glasses serve as both physical object and metaphorical device for his perspective. However, Elena's character feels somewhat underdeveloped and her "murky tenderness" feels more told than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot has strong coherence with Marcus's plan to escape building effectively throughout. The webs of intrigue concept drives the story forward naturally. The marble dust interference with tracking systems creates a satisfying method for his disappearance. The story achieves a complete arc within the constraints, though the exact mechanics of his escape remain somewhat ambiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building creates a vivid lunar setting with tangible details. The contrast between Earth's "last quarry" and the sterile moon creates thematic resonance. The integration of the car washing cycle with the escape plan is seamless. Sensory details like dust motes in sunbeams and the pressurized dome create immersive atmosphere that enhances the themes of confinement and freedom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—particularly the dust particles, marble, and light—to reinforce themes of freedom and artistic rebellion. The ending delivers emotional impact and philosophical resonance. The narrative successfully shows rather than tells, allowing Marcus's actions and observations to reveal his character. The central conflict between artistic integrity and corporate exploitation is well-established and resolved in a satisfying way.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls with consistent tone and authentic character motivation. The metaphors (Earth's bones, dust like stars) feel fresh rather than generic. The narrative demonstrates originality in its sci-fi artist rebellion concept. Some phrases ("murky tenderness reserved for those about to betray you") feel slightly overwritten, and the ending leans toward a somewhat predictable transcendence trope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with strong thematic resonance. The prose maintains a consistent literary quality that serves the story's themes of art, freedom, and rebellion. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with a satisfying arc from confinement to escape. The story leaves readers with philosophical questions about art's liberating power and corporate exploitation that extend beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
