<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's character is effectively shaped by her sleeplessness, which heightens her sensory perception and connects her to the attic's whispers. Her journey from writing "death poems" to understanding "the power unused" shows meaningful growth. However, her initial motivations could be more deeply established—we understand her transformation better than what drove her to collect poisonous plants in the first place.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves elegantly from the poet arranging deadly plants to discovering the previous tenant's journal to her own epiphany about non-violence. The structure effectively mirrors the character's transformation. The revelation about elimination through understanding rather than poison creates a satisfying arc. The "drunken confessions" element feels slightly underdeveloped compared to other plot elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic is exceptionally rendered with "whispers," "memories trapped in wood grain and dust motes," and "where time folded differently." The contrast between the frenetic subway stops and the contemplative attic creates meaningful tension. The sensory details of "creaking floorboards" and the house "exhaling decades of held breath" bring the setting to vivid life and directly support the story's themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves substantial depth through its exploration of power, restraint, and transformation. The metaphor of preserved poisonous plants as "beautiful, dangerous, impotent things" powerfully embodies the theme of "power unused." The ending delivers emotional satisfaction and philosophical weight. However, the dialogue is minimal, and the revelation could be slightly more earned through additional context about the poet's initial violent intentions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates a distinctive voice with fresh metaphors like "insomnia-brightened eyes" and the house "exhaling decades of held breath." The narrative maintains consistency throughout without relying on clichés or purple prose. The botanical imagery feels organic to the story rather than formulaic. The story subverts expectations by transforming potentially violent elements into a meditation on peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story succeeds in weaving all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The brevity works in its favor, creating a concentrated meditation on power and restraint. The lingering impression is substantial—the image of deadly plants rendered harmless through preservation perfectly embodies the theme. Minor refinements to the character's initial motivations would elevate it further.</comment>
