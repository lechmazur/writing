<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marisa's character development is strong and nuanced. Her motivation (avenging her sister while preserving memory) drives her actions consistently. The sugar sculpting as political resistance reveals her character's precisely creative nature while demonstrating psychological depth. Her transformation from revenge-seeker to hope-bearer feels earned. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into her internal struggle when deciding to abandon her vendetta.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally well-crafted within the constraints. The counterattack through art evolves naturally into a journey of discovery. The trail of photographs creates a compelling throughline, with each discovery building tension and revealing more about the sister's true mission. The narrative achieves remarkable completeness with a clear beginning (market sculpting), middle (discovery of photographs), and resolution (decision to continue her sister's quest).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market creates a hauntingly evocative setting that perfectly embodies the story's themes of memory, resistance, and hidden potential. Sensory details are masterfully deployed—candlelight on sugar-glass, the acrid memory of tear gas, the contrast of beauty amid ruins. The market's transformation from center of commerce to battleground to gateway mirrors Marisa's emotional journey, creating a symbiotic relationship between character and setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves significant emotional impact through its careful balance of personal grief and political resistance. Metaphors are fresh and meaningful—particularly the sugar phoenixes as symbols of rebirth from destruction. The subtext about different forms of resistance (open rebellion versus seeking alternative futures) adds philosophical depth. The ending satisfies while opening to new possibilities. The only weakness is a slight tendency toward exposition in explaining the sister's journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its concept of confectionery as political resistance. The writing avoids clichés and predictable patterns, with consistently fresh imagery and metaphors. Emotions are shown rather than told, particularly Marisa's "trembling rage that never left her bones." The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate but generally maintains purposeful elegance. The handling of the rebellion context avoids formulaic dystopian tropes through specific, personal details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite its many required elements, integrating them so naturally that none feel forced. The candy sculpting, photographs, forgotten market, and hidden continent work together to create a multilayered narrative about memory, resistance, and hope. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each word serving the story's emotional and thematic resonance. The lingering question of what awaits on the hidden continent provides satisfying depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
