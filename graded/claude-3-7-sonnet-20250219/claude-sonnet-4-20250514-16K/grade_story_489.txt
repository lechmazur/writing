<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's spirit is depicted with consistent motivation and the "aggressively kind" attribute shapes his actions coherently. However, the character lacks depth beyond his function as a plot device. We learn little about his personal history or inner conflict, making him a somewhat flat vehicle for the story's thematic concerns rather than a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has clear cause-and-effect relationships and achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The action of flinging the whistle drives the narrative forward logically. The connection between the beginning (dancer missing crucial element) and resolution (tradition preserved) is coherent. However, the conflict's resolution feels somewhat too neat and predictable, lacking complication that would elevate the narrative tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-integrated with the timeframe and action. The atmosphere of supernatural watchfulness paired with the coastal environment creates a vivid sense of place. Sensory details like "salt air" and the "whale's ancient voice" effectively immerse the reader, while the contrasting elements of death and living tradition enhance the thematic resonance of the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of tradition, connection across generations, and the persistence of cultural memory. The lighthouse beam serves as a potent symbol, and the writing successfully creates emotional resonance. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing in places ("each gesture carrying the undercurrent of wisdom"), and the theme of cultural preservation is handled somewhat didactically rather than emerging organically through subtler storytelling techniques.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids the most obvious AI-writing markers, it suffers from moments of purple prose ("threads of old knowledge that had nearly been severed") and relies on somewhat predictable narrative patterns. The emotional resonance feels manufactured rather than earned through nuanced character development. The ghost-helps-maintain-tradition plot follows familiar supernatural helper tropes without significant subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates competent integration of assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with clear thematic concerns. The supernatural folkloric approach works well with the elements provided. However, the writing occasionally prioritizes lofty phrasing over authentic emotional impact, and the resolution feels too neatly packaged for a story dealing with the complex themes of cultural erosion and preservation. The story achieves its basic aims but lacks the distinctive voice or subversive approach that would elevate it to exceptional status.</comment>
