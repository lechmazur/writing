<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's character is somewhat developed through her relationship with the CD and grandmother's memory, but her "loudly introverted" trait feels more told than shown. Her motivation becomes clearer as the story progresses, but her personality lacks nuance and distinctive voice. Her wary explorer attribute shapes her cautious approach, but doesn't evolve meaningfully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses meandering and firefly-following to create movement through the cathedral. The structure has a clear beginning, middle and end despite constraints, with Maya's discovery of the CD leading naturally to her final realization about courage. The ending provides satisfying resolution, though the middle section could be tightened for stronger causality between events.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The neon cathedral setting is richly rendered with evocative details - cracked stained glass, digital saints, electric hymns, and marble floors create a vivid post-human sanctuary. The juxtaposition of ancient religious architecture with digital/quantum elements establishes an effectively haunting atmosphere. The setting and timeframe work together exceptionally well to create a distinctive world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses fireflies as both literal guides and metaphorical emblems of courage, creating resonant symbolism. The damaged CD serves as a meaningful connection to the past. The emotional journey feels authentic, with the protagonist finding renewed purpose. The theme of courage manifesting in small persistent acts rather than grand gestures is thoughtfully developed, though some passages rely too heavily on telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the post-apocalyptic setting is creative, the narrative relies on some familiar tropes (lost technology from the past, abandoned religious buildings). Some metaphors ("scarred by time," "tiny light pulsed like an emblem") feel somewhat generic. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("in luminous spirals that painted hope across her weathered face"). However, the integration of technology with spirituality and the firefly imagery show originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The neon cathedral setting and post-human timeframe particularly enhance the theme of persisting courage. While occasionally veering into overwrought description, the writing generally serves the emotional core of the story. The fireflies as courage metaphor creates depth that lingers beyond the narrative's conclusion.</comment>
