<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ezra's characterization as a man fleeing emotional pain through obsessive documentation is well-developed. His woodsman identity informs his comfort in abandoned places, and his motivation feels authentic. The hairbrush serves as a powerful emotional tether. His internal conflict between avoidance and confrontation with grief is conveyed through both actions and inner monologue. The character lacks some nuance in places—his epiphany feels slightly accelerated—but overall presents a compelling psychological portrait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is effectively structured within the word constraint, moving from denial to revelation with the short-circuiting equipment serving as a catalyst for emotional breakthrough. The story achieves a satisfying resolution as Ezra abandons his equipment and walks away transformed. The metaphorical mapping of abandoned places as parallel to his emotional state creates strong thematic coherence. The plot might benefit from slightly more concrete stakes, but the emotional journey is clearly tracked from beginning to end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is exceptionally rendered with specific, evocative details that perfectly mirror the character's emotional state. The juxtaposition of technical equipment against decaying infrastructure creates tension that enhances the story's themes. Sensory details are precise and meaningful—rusted antenna towers, the silver handle catching light, mechanical beeps echoing human sounds. The abandoned infrastructure becomes a powerful metaphor for emotional neglect while maintaining concrete physical presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its central metaphor of mapping abandoned places as a substitute for confronting grief. The subtext is rich throughout, with evocative imagery (equipment sparking "like angry fireflies") serving the theme of avoiding emotional honesty. The ending delivers a satisfying catharsis while avoiding sentimentality. The narrative effectively "shows" Ezra's emotional state through his actions and observations rather than stating feelings directly. The thematic exploration of how we process loss is nuanced and thought-provoking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates a distinctive voice and style, with fresh metaphors ("the truth finally surfaced like a rusty rail spike through melting snow") that avoid cliché. The story maintains consistent tone and handles emotional content with subtlety. There's psychological complexity in how Ezra rationalizes his behavior. The integration of technical details with emotional narrative feels authentic rather than formulaic. A few phrases ("because people were too complicated") veer slightly toward telling rather than showing, but most emotions are conveyed through concrete details and actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative. The radio wave garden and mapping project don't feel like arbitrary inclusions but serve the central theme of avoiding emotional honesty. The hairbrush functions as both physical tether and emotional symbol. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constrained, with each element contributing to the psychological portrait. The story leaves a lingering emotional impact through its exploration of grief, avoidance, and the possibility of healing through confronting what we fear.</comment>
