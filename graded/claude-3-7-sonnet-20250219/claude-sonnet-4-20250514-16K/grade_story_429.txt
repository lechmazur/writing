<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maja's character as an earthy farmer is well-developed through her "weathered hands" and understanding of "patience and precision." Her motivation to unlock ancestral knowledge is clear and consistent. Her reaction to the recording restoration reveals her deep connection to her heritage. However, we could benefit from more insight into her internal struggles or conflicts beyond fulfilling her grandmother's legacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the action of celebrating to create a satisfying arc. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships between the aurora's movements, the spice measurements, and the restoration of recordings. The beginning connects seamlessly to the end as Maja completes her ancestral mission. The pacing manages to create anticipation and resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The northern lights viewing platform creates a mystical backdrop that perfectly complements the supernatural elements. The aurora's "folding" timeframe creates tension and urgency. Sensory details are exceptional—the brass gleaming under ethereal green light, the fragrant oils of cardamom catching the strange light—immersing readers in this liminal space. The atmosphere of hushed reverence enhances both the setting and Maja's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder and reverence through rich imagery and symbolism. The spice merchant's scale represents the precision of knowledge transmission across generations. The central conflict of recovering lost wisdom is effectively introduced and resolved. The theme of preserving ancestral knowledge resonates beyond the immediate narrative. The writing "shows" emotional weight through Maja's tears and careful movements rather than merely telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids AI hallmarks like repetitive phrasing or generic descriptions. Metaphors like "the sky folds like paper" feel fresh. The concept of using spices to restore recordings demonstrates originality. The handling of the aurora's electromagnetic properties shows thoughtful world-building. Minor weakness: some descriptions occasionally verge on purple prose ("dimensional pockets of shimmering possibility"). Overall, the narrative maintains consistent tone and demonstrates inventive interpretation of assigned elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole. The elements serve the narrative rather than feeling forced.

The story leaves readers pondering the value of lost knowledge and intergenerational wisdom.</comment>
