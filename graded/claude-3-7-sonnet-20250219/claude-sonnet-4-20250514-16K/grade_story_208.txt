<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The automated postal sorting facility transforms brilliantly from mundane to magical, becoming a perfect metaphorical space for processing human regrets.

The atmosphere perfectly embodies joyful despair, creating a liminal space where mechanical precision meets human emotion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves powerful emotional resonance through its central metaphor of sorting regrets like mail. Literary devices are masterfully employed—particularly the backwards-writing pen and the transformation of sorting machines into instruments. The ending feels both conclusive and open-ended in a purposeful way. The theme of finding beauty in abandoned possibilities resonates deeply, with the machines' performance of unfinished songs creating a poignant meditation on artistic fulfillment and lost potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its premise and execution. The postal facility as metaphor for processing regrets feels fresh, and descriptions like "a symphony of might-have-beens performed by robots who didn't understand heartbreak" avoid cliché. The writing style maintains consistency and demonstrates individual flair through surprising but apt metaphors. A few phrases occasionally edge toward purple prose but generally remain effective, with emotions shown through specific actions rather than stated directly.</comment>
