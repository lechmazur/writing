<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The necromancer's character is partially developed through her relationship with Devon and her use of abilities in cave exploration. However, her personality remains somewhat generic, with limited exploration of how necromancy shapes her worldview. Her motivation is clear (mapping for resources) but lacks emotional depth beyond professional necessity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has logical progression but lacks tension and stakes despite the mention of colony survival. The mapping action drives movement but not dramatic conflict. The story gestures at an arc without delivering a satisfying conclusion or transformation, merely suggesting "something extraordinary" without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is effectively rendered with sensory details like humidity, vibrations, and electromagnetic resonance. The futuristic colony with terraforming needs contrasted against Earth nostalgia creates a compelling atmosphere. However, the necromancy element feels underdeveloped within this otherwise well-realized environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth through the contrast between technological necessity and human connection, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing. The ending lacks impact, substituting discovery potential for actual resolution. The prose occasionally reaches for literary effect but often settles for explanation rather than evocation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The writing exhibits AI-typical patterns: unnecessarily ornate phrases ("crystalline cave's ethereal glow," "the cave's humid breath"), overreliance on adjectives, and generic emotional descriptions. Character interactions feel formulaic, and the necromancy element is handled with predictable mysticism rather than originality. The film references read as superficially inserted rather than organically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story competently incorporates assigned elements, they often feel stitched together rather than organically integrated. The necromancer's abilities, for instance, feel disconnected from the old movie motif. The prose is serviceable but lacks a distinctive voice or standout imagery that would elevate it beyond a functional exercise.</comment>
