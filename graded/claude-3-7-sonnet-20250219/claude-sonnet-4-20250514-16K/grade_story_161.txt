<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus's vigilant character and motivation are well-established through his punctuality and observational skills transferred from orcharding to surveillance. His consistent carrying of the peacock seal effectively ties to his past and purpose. However, his internal voice sometimes feels artificially constructed rather than naturally emerging from his experience, and his sudden transition from apparently compliant volunteer to confident whistleblower lacks sufficient psychological development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, linking Marcus's demonstration of wind tunnel settings to his discovery and subsequent escape with evidence. The conspiracy unfolds logically through observed patterns, though the revelation that he's been secretly documenting inconsistencies for months feels abruptly introduced rather than organically integrated into the narrative progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility effectively contrasts with Marcus's destroyed orchard, creating meaningful thematic tension. The clinical testing environment enhances the cold corporate conspiracy atmosphere. However, sensory details are sparse beyond visual observations, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through sounds, smells, or tactile elements that would strengthen the sterile, technological setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock seal as both literal object and metaphorical device, creating layers of meaning through its connection to vigilance, display, and pattern recognition. The irony of the vigilant orchardist noticing what aerospace engineers miss provides satisfying thematic resonance. The ending delivers emotional payoff through its promise of justice, though the exact nature of the conspiracy remains somewhat nebulous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the peacock-pattern concept shows originality, the corporate conspiracy narrative follows predictable whistleblower tropes. The character's interior voice occasionally defaults to telling emotional states rather than showing them. The villain's reaction (Dr. Henley lunging for lockdown) reads as a generic response lacking nuance. Some descriptions ("deliciously appropriate revenge," "savage satisfaction") rely on somewhat formulaic emotional qualifiers rather than specific, unique reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates diverse elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic unity around vigilance, patterns, and justice. The peacock seal works particularly well as both plot device and symbol. While the conspiracy plot maintains tension and resolution, the corporate villainy lacks distinctive qualities that would elevate it beyond familiar tropes. The sardonic tone is consistent but occasionally overwritten, particularly in dialogue.</comment>
