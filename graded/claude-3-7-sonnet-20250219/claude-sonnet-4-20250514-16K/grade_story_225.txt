<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evangeline is well-developed through her apothecary background informing her scientific curiosity about the butterflies while maintaining emotional depth. Her character evolution from scientific observer to emotional participant feels authentic. However, her backstory regarding guild abandonment could be more deeply integrated into her current motivations rather than mentioned as exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the morse code signals, infected butterflies, and unconventional love into a cohesive narrative arc. The progression from scientific observation to emotional connection provides a satisfying structure that culminates in mutual recognition. The cause-effect relationship between Evangeline's tapping and the butterflies' responses creates compelling tension within the limited word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting brilliantly contrasts mechanical human innovation with natural biological adaptation. Sensory details like the fogging metal, crushing pressure, and bioluminescent wings create an immersive atmosphere. The world-building effectively establishes a post-conflict reality where beauty persists despite environmental devastation, reinforcing the theme of resilience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through effective symbolism—butterflies as messengers of love across impossible boundaries mirrors humanity's capacity for connection despite division. The narrative shows rather than tells Evangeline's emotional transformation through her physical responses. The ending offers a satisfying resolution while maintaining a sense of wonder about continued possibilities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While generally original, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("peculiar warmth of unconventional love blooming in her chest"). The story avoids most clichés and creates a unique premise, but occasionally slips into predictable emotional descriptions. The concept of butterflies as communicative vessels is genuinely innovative, though the love story trajectory follows somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the constraint of assigned components. The steampunk setting, morse code communication, and infected butterflies create a distinctive world that feels complete despite brevity. The narrative achieves depth through its exploration of connection across boundaries while maintaining thematic consistency throughout.</comment>
