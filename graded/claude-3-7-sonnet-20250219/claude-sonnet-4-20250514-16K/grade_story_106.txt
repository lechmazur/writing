<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is established effectively as a sullen farmer-turned-maintenance worker with clear backstory and motivation. His character transformation is well-developed through his connection to the quilt and the stamps. However, the character could benefit from more distinctive voice or dialogue to elevate his personality beyond the narrative descriptions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates strong coherence with clear cause-effect relationships. Marcus's discovery of inspiration through the stamps creates a satisfying arc from despair to hope. The structure flows naturally from problem to realization to solution, with the quilt serving as both catalyst and metaphorical guide. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining appropriate ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater power station setting is richly developed and perfectly complements the themes of isolation and forgotten purpose. The contrast between the cold, mechanical environment and the personal, handcrafted quilt creates compelling tension. Sensory details like the "eternal song" of turbines establish a vivid atmosphere that enhances both character motivation and plot development.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs symbolism through the quilt and stamps to explore themes of connection, repurposing, and transcending limitations. The narrative shows rather than tells Marcus's emotional journey, with the quilt serving as both literal and metaphorical catalyst. The central conflict between isolation and connection is resolved with emotional resonance and thematic depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its setting and central metaphor. While occasionally relying on some predictable emotional beats, it generally avoids clich√©s through specific, meaningful details like the composition of the quilt. The narrative maintains consistent tone and presents a fresh perspective on isolation and connection. Some phrasings ("electric zest") feel slightly forced, but most of the writing exhibits authentic human nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The narrative balances specificity with universal themes, creating emotional resonance within its word limit. The conclusion leaves readers with lingering questions about connection and repurposing that extend beyond the immediate narrative, suggesting deeper thematic exploration despite brevity.</comment>
