<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus demonstrates a clear arc from fear to acceptance of his supernatural abilities, consistent with his methodical approach to understanding ghosts. However, his character feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond his ghost-seeing ability. The "elegantly clumsy" attribute is shown but not fully integrated into his deeper personality. His dialogue with Eleanor shows promising depth but remains limited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses coherently from Marcus's initial work to his ghost encounter and resolution, effectively using the "dissect" action as both literal methodology and metaphorical approach. The resolution feels somewhat hastily arrived at, though the story does achieve a complete arc within the constraints. The transition from fear to acceptance could benefit from more development of the intervening emotional states.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a distinctive, original setting that beautifully complements the ghost story. The juxtaposition of preservation science with supernatural elements creates effective tension. Sensory details like the "humming" elevator shaft, "pockets of absolute quiet," and the ghost's voice "like sand shifting in wind" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances both the setting and ghost encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ghost encounter to explore themes of witnessing, remembrance, and connecting worlds. The metaphor of "debugging faulty elevator code" cleverly connects Marcus's profession to his supernatural experiences. While the emotional resolution feels somewhat rushed, the story's central message about liberation through connection rather than escape shows depth. The ghost's desire to be remembered creates genuine emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the sand castle lab setting shows originality, the ghost bride narrative relies on familiar tropes without substantial subversion. Phrases like "the dissonance of silence" appear multiple times without development, suggesting formulaic repetition. The ghost's characterization remains somewhat generic, and certain descriptions ("elegantly clumsy fingers") feel unnecessarily ornate. The ending resolution arrives too neatly to feel fully authentic to human emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a consistent tone and theme. The concept of liberation through witnessing rather than escaping provides meaningful depth beyond the surface ghost story. While the story sometimes strains to incorporate all elements naturally (particularly "elegantly clumsy"), it ultimately creates a thoughtful exploration of connection across boundaries. The brevity occasionally compromises character development but generally serves the ghost story format well.</comment>
