<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's character as a social media exorcist has potential, but her "quietly loud" attribute feels somewhat artificially inserted rather than organically demonstrated. Her motivation is clear (tracking down Marcus), though the exact stakes and personal investment remain underdeveloped. Her distinct method of infiltration fits her character, but her personality lacks the nuanced development needed for a truly compelling protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the "reignite" action to drive the narrative forward, with the receipt serving as a logical connection between Maya and Marcus. The arc moves coherently from observation to confrontation to resolution. However, the story would benefit from greater tension before the too-quick resolution in the final lines, where Marcus immediately surrenders without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned military base with its mess hall, music venue, and underground tunnels creates a compellingly atmospheric setting that enhances the digital ghost-hunting concept. The juxtaposition of decaying physical spaces with digital hauntings works effectively. Specific sensory details like "cracked window," "rusted serving windows," and "dim glow of laptop screens" successfully immerse the reader in this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the digital exorcist concept is intriguing, the story's impact is diminished by telling rather than showing Maya's abilities and reputation. The central conflict resolves too easily, with Marcus immediately recognizing defeat. The metaphors linking digital and spiritual hauntings show promise, but the ending feels rushed rather than satisfying, missing an opportunity for deeper thematic exploration of digital identity or technological ghosts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "social media exorcist" concept offers originality, but execution relies on telling rather than showing Maya's abilities. The writing contains several instances of unnecessarily complex phrasing ("indifferent enthusiasm," "quietly loud presence") that feel artificial rather than organic to the narrative. Character emotions are often stated rather than demonstrated, and the confrontation resolves with predictable ease rather than surprising complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story effectively incorporates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about digital hauntings. The concept of "social media exorcist" shows creative thinking, but the story feels somewhat constrained by its elements rather than transcending them. While the premise and setting are strong, the resolution feels rushed and lacks the emotional or intellectual resonance that would elevate it to memorable fiction.</comment>
