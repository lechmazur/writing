<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-established with the "mild-mannered trapper" attribute informing his careful, methodical approach to preservation. His mechanically intuitive mind forms a compelling bridge between indigenous knowledge and modern technology. However, his emotional depth feels somewhat underdeveloped—we understand his mission more than we feel his personal stakes. His voice lacks distinctive qualities that would make him fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Marcus's decision to encode indigenous knowledge into the diner's infrastructure. The scattered equations, dice-reading, and circuit recalibration create a coherent methodology. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints—from problem (impending demolition) to solution (preservation through integration)—with the emulation action driving meaningful change. The resolution feels earned rather than contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner creates a powerful juxtaposition of indigenous wisdom against technological progress. Sensory details—neon chrome flickering, holographic light through cracked windows, circuit boards humming—effectively establish both physical setting and thematic tensions. The atmosphere of impending change permeates everything, with corporate towers literally casting shadows over the indigenous quarter. The setting becomes an extension of the story's central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story successfully employs rich symbolism (the dice as both ancient tool and quantum metaphor) and creates emotional resonance through its themes of preservation amid erasure. The central conflict between indigenous wisdom and technological progress is effectively established. The ending delivers a subtle yet powerful resolution that suggests revolution through adaptation rather than resistance. Some metaphors occasionally border on overwriting but generally enhance rather than distract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story's premise is innovative, some phrasing feels overly mannered ("pulse through every wire and beam," "beating with an ancient heart"). The "computational folklore" concept is original, but the execution occasionally relies on familiar indigenous/technology dichotomies. The prose sometimes reaches for profundity at the expense of naturalness. Metaphors like "the most profound revolutions happened one calibrated frequency at a time" feel somewhat formulaic in their construction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The interweaving of indigenous knowledge with futuristic technology creates genuine thematic resonance. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about preservation, adaptation, and hidden forms of resistance. Some occasional overwriting and strained metaphors prevent it from reaching the highest tier of literary excellence, but it remains thoughtful and evocative.</comment>
