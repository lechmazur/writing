<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The character's loyalty as a scout is established but underdeveloped. Marcus's internal conflict between spreading meditation techniques and seeking peace himself offers complexity, but his personality lacks distinguishing features beyond his mission. His grandmother's influence provides backstory but feels tacked on rather than integral to his characterization. His voice in the radio broadcasts hints at dimension but doesn't fully reveal his personality beyond his sanctified mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot coherently connects Marcus's broadcasting of coded messages to his personal struggle, but the stakes remain unclear. The structure establishes a situation rather than a complete arc with resolution. While the blackout creates atmosphere, it doesn't substantively impact plot progression. The cause-effect relationship between his meditation broadcasting and any tangible outcome remains underdeveloped, leaving the narrative feeling more like a character study than a fully realized plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a blackout creates a compelling visual contrast that effectively symbolizes the story's themes of illumination amid darkness. Sensory details like "lights flickered below like dying fireflies" and the "humming generators" establish isolation and tension. The setting meaningfully connects to both the moth symbolism and meditation concept. However, the world beyond the tower remains nebulous, limiting the reader's understanding of the societal context that makes meditation "radical."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moth symbolism as a metaphor for transformation and illumination, creating multilayered meaning. The contrast between Marcus broadcasting techniques he himself struggles to master adds depth. However, the central conflict lacks urgency and the ending provides no real resolution. While the meditation-as-resistance concept is intriguing, the story doesn't fully explore why this would be considered radical or dangerous, diminishing potential impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story displays some originality in connecting moth observation to meditation and resistance movements, but relies on formulaic expressions like "the sanctified dread of his mission weighing heavily" and "the familiar anxiety clawing at his ribcage." The resistance movement premise feels underdeveloped and derivative. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate ("the very turbulence you sought to calm would threaten to destroy you") without substantive payoff. The jokes-as-code concept is clever but implemented predictably.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements competently, particularly the connection between moths and meditation. However, it struggles to establish genuine stakes or a fully realized world in which meditation would require coded broadcasting. While the imagery and symbolism show promise, the narrative feels incompleteâ€”more a vignette than a story with resolution. The concept has merit but needs sharper execution and more specific worldbuilding to achieve its potential impact.</comment>
