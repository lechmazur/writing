<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya emerges as a compelling protagonist whose consistent smile belies the "controlled fury" and "peaceful kind of wrath" that drives her mysterious mission. Her character is defined by contradiction—finding beauty in decay, channeling anger into methodical purpose—which creates depth. Her motivation (channeling star's wrath) shapes her actions consistently. The only limitation is that we see little development or arc, merely a sustained characterization, and her deeper background remains unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with deliberate purpose from observation to action as Maya achieves her goal of broadcasting the mannequins' frequencies. There's clear progression from study to execution. However, while the beginning and end connect conceptually, the story relies heavily on abstract concepts without clarifying what concrete change will result from Maya's broadcasts. The stakes and specific consequences remain ambiguous, leaving the resolution feeling somewhat incomplete despite the narrative arc's technical completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The suspended radio tower city creates a hauntingly effective setting that physically embodies the story's themes of decay, communication, and liminal spaces. The perpetual twilight, gentle swaying of towers, and rust-streaked surfaces evoke a rich sensory atmosphere. The mannequins and radio equipment form a cohesive ecosystem of abandoned objects given new purpose. The setting doesn't merely house the story but actively participates in its meaning, creating a distinctive and memorable world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively employs metaphor and imagery that reinforce its central themes—particularly in how the damaged flashlight parallels Maya's philosophy about imperfection's power. The narrative succeeds in building tension through controlled pacing and evocative sensory details. However, while thematically rich, the story's impact is somewhat diminished by ambiguity about what Maya's broadcast will actually accomplish. The "awakening the world" remains too abstract to deliver maximum emotional impact, despite the otherwise strong craft elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, avoiding predictable narrative patterns. Its integration of cosmic concepts with tactile details feels fresh rather than formulaic. The prose maintains consistent tone and avoids purple language while still achieving a distinctive voice. Particularly strong is the nuanced handling of Maya's anger as "not destructive rage but something cooler, more purposeful." The mannequins could have easily become a horror cliché, but instead are rendered with restraint and originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite its abstract elements, weaving them together into a unified vision where each assigned component serves the central narrative and thematic purpose. The brevity works to create a dreamlike, suggestive quality appropriate to the content. What prevents a higher score is the lingering vagueness about concrete outcomes—while the mystery is partly effective, slightly more specificity about Maya's ultimate purpose would ground the otherwise well-executed story and provide stronger closure.</comment>
