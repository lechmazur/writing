<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's quietly rebellious nature is well-established and consistent throughout the narrative. Her character as a guardian of small rebellions emerges naturally through her actions with the neon signs. However, her backstory and deeper motivations remain somewhat underdevelopedâ€”we know what she does but less about why she became this way or what personal stakes drive her mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses Maya's sign-changing action to drive the narrative and creates a satisfying micro-arc within the word limit. The beginning (finding the DVD) connects well to the end (seeing her reflection in it). However, there's limited dramatic tension or escalation, and the cause-effect relationships, while present, lack complexity that would elevate the story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fairy light repair shop and post-parade timeframe create a distinctive atmosphere that enhances the story's themes. The contrast between the cramped, private workspace and the public-facing neon signs works effectively. Sensory details like the "amber glow" and the "peculiar hush" of post-celebration streets create a vivid, immersive setting that supports the magical-realist tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses metaphor and symbolism, particularly with light/electricity as resistance against darkness/cynicism. The central theme of small acts of hope in a cynical world emerges organically. While the emotional impact is strong, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing ("this was her method"), and the ending, while thematically resonant, lacks a strong culminating moment that would provide greater impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise feels original, some imagery verges on purple prose ("pulse with their own dying breath") and relies on familiar tropes about cynicism versus hope. Several metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("sanctuary of mended lights"). The emotional resonance is genuine, but the language sometimes becomes too deliberate in its poetic aspirations, disrupting the authenticity of Maya's perspective and actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds in integrating its assigned elements cohesively within a tight framework. The central metaphor of repairing lights as repairing hope works beautifully, and there's a lingering emotional resonance to Maya's quiet activism. However, the execution occasionally sacrifices narrative tension for lyrical description, and some opportunities for deeper character development or conflict resolution remain unexplored.</comment>
