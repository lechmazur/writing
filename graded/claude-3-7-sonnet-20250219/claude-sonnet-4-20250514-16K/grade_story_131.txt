<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character development as an aloof orphan who learns to open herself emotionally is well-crafted. Her emotional detachment is consistently established and gradually transformed through her interaction with the stones. However, the transformation feels slightly accelerated within the constraints, and we could benefit from more specific instances of her past disappointments to better understand her initial aloofness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the cleaning of the garage as a frame for Maya's emotional journey. The cryptic message creates strong forward momentum, and there's a satisfying arc from emotional isolation to openness. The cause-and-effect relationship between the gravitational anomaly, the stones' properties, and Maya's transformation is logical and well-developed within the tight constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a unique, vivid setting that brilliantly serves as both literal and metaphorical backdrop for Maya's emotional state. Sensory details like dust motes drifting upward and suspended tools create an immersive atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the protagonist's internal "loosening." The anomaly and stones work together as physical manifestations of the story's theme of adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the gravitational anomaly as metaphor for emotional untethering, with strong "show don't tell" moments. The central conflict between holding on and letting go is powerfully conveyed. The narrative skillfully balances physical and emotional elements, using the stones' properties to externalize Maya's internal journey. However, the resolution could benefit from one more concrete action to demonstrate her new willingness to connect.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its inventive use of the gravitational anomaly as metaphor. The writing avoids purple prose and maintains consistent tone. However, some phrases like "adapt or perish" feel slightly formulaic, and the emotional revelation comes somewhat predictably. While the core concept is innovative, the emotional arc follows a somewhat conventional pattern of resistance-to-acceptance that slightly diminishes its uniqueness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The gravitational anomaly serves as both literal setting and metaphorical framework, while the stones function as physical objects and emotional catalysts. The narrative leaves readers with lingering questions about Maya's future connections. Its primary weakness is the slightly accelerated emotional transformation that would benefit from more development in a longer format.</comment>
