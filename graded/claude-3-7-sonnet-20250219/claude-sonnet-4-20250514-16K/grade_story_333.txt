<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization as a sincere rebel is established effectively through her preservationist values and willingness to trespass to save the academy. Her internal conflict about accepting her role as guardian shows development, though her emotional journey could be more nuanced. Her motivation to preserve traditions and connect with her grandmother's legacy is clear, but her personality lacks distinctive quirks that would make her fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses Maya's theorizing to advance the narrative and create revelations about her grandmother's role. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from discovery to understanding to acceptance. However, the transition from fear to acceptance feels slightly rushed, and the stakes of the demolition could be more concretely established. The cause-effect relationships are logical but would benefit from more specific details about what exactly is being preserved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage creates a rich, atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the theme of preservation. Sensory details like the copper taste in the air, the pulsing walls, and the contrasting storms outside create a vivid environment. The setting actively participates in the narrative through the changing symbols and portraits. The physical space brilliantly embodies the thematic concerns about tradition and legacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the building as both literal setting and metaphor for tradition and inheritance. The emotional core—fear of breaking an unbroken chain—resonates powerfully. The imagery of walls "contracting and expanding like a living throat" creates memorable visuals. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing Maya's emotional transformation, and the subtext about institutional change versus tradition could be more subtly woven throughout rather than explained directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on several familiar tropes of hidden passages and family legacies. The writing occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate ("malevolent life," "copper and old secrets") without adding substantive meaning. The character's emotional journey follows a predictable arc from resistance to acceptance. The constantly changing symbols are an inventive element, but their explanation is too direct rather than allowing readers to discover their meaning through Maya's actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about legacy and responsibility. The haunted passage serves both plot and thematic purposes effectively. However, the story occasionally prioritizes telling over showing, particularly in explaining Maya's emotional transformation and the significance of the symbols. The writing, while competent, sometimes reaches for poetic effect at the expense of authenticity. Nevertheless, it leaves readers with meaningful questions about tradition versus progress.</comment>
