<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's character as an insomniac poet is well-established and her connection to the botanical samples feels authentic. Her motivation to reclaim her grandmother's legacy shows clear development. However, her character could be more deeply explored through internal conflict rather than primarily external circumstances. Her poet identity feels somewhat superficial, mentioned but not demonstrated through her perspective or language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with logical cause-effect relationships between Maya's discovery and her decision. The timeframe constraint feels natural. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed - the transition from realization to decisive action happens too abruptly without showing the emotional weight of her decision or potential obstacles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway settings are richly developed with sensory details like "coffee-stained notebooks" and "rhythmic clacking of train wheels." The atmosphere of haunting whispers complements the botanical theme excellently. The contrast between the cramped, haunted private space and the public transit creates effective tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively employs the botanical motif as both literal and metaphorical elements, showing how knowledge can be corrupted or healing. The theme of reclaiming non-violent traditions has depth. However, the story relies too heavily on exposition rather than dramatization in key moments, particularly in revealing Marcus's scheme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the botanical theme is handled with originality, the narrative follows somewhat predictable patterns of inheritance and legacy corruption. The ghostly element feels slightly generic in execution. The prose occasionally veers toward overexplanation ("The ghosts... weren't hostileâ€”they were desperate") rather than allowing readers to infer meaning through subtler cues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements while maintaining cohesion. The botanical theme carries emotional and thematic weight. The story provides a satisfying resolution while leaving room for reader reflection about the ethics of knowledge and inheritance. However, it would benefit from more subtle handling of its themes and allowing more space for character interiority.</comment>
