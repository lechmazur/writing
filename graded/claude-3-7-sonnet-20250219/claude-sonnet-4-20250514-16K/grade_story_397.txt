<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's character has an effective trajectory from invisible service worker to unexpected detective, with clear motivation stemming from his systematic marginalization. His "genuinely strange obsession" with receipts is well-integrated into his personality. However, his interior life lacks sufficient depth—we get little of his emotional landscape beyond surface observations, and his transformation from passive observer to active justice-seeker feels somewhat abrupt without more groundwork for this shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the discovery of the bloodstained scalpel as a catalyst and builds logically to the confrontation with Professor Chen. The narrative achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with satisfying cause-and-effect relationships. The method of comparing doodles on receipts drives the investigation forward in a unique way. However, the plot relies somewhat heavily on coincidental timing with the fireworks countdown, and the transmission to "international news outlets" stretches credibility without more explanation of Marcus's preparation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory provides an evocative, distinctive setting that's thematically connected to the story's revelation. The metaphor of crystal formation mirroring the emergence of truth is particularly strong. The fireworks create both temporal urgency and symbolic illumination. Sensory details like "rainbow light through laboratory windows" and crystals pulsing with reflected light create vivid atmosphere. The juxtaposition of celebration outside with dark revelation inside creates effective dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the crystallization metaphor throughout, creating thematic coherence between setting and justice. The line "Justice, like perfect crystal formation, required precise environmental conditions" exemplifies this strength. The contrast between scientific brilliance and moral corruption creates thought-provoking subtext. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, and some of the exposition about Helena's murder feels compressed rather than organically revealed. The ending achieves poignancy but could delve deeper into Marcus's emotional response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the crystal/truth metaphor demonstrates originality, certain aspects feel formulaic. The countdown device is somewhat predictable, and phrases like "painting rainbow light" and "geological patience" veer toward purple prose. The villain's reveal follows conventional patterns without subversion. There's inconsistent handling of emotion—sometimes effectively shown through actions, other times flatly stated. The concept of overlooked service workers seeing what others miss has been explored in similar narratives without sufficient fresh perspective here.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous required elements into a cohesive whole, particularly the laboratory setting, receipts method, and bartender character. The fireworks timeframe creates effective dramatic tension. However, the compression of the murder investigation into this short format requires some explanatory shortcuts that stretch credibility. The writing occasionally prioritizes flowery language over clarity. Nevertheless, the story achieves a satisfying resolution while suggesting broader themes about visibility, justice, and patient observation.</comment>
