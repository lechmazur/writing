<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin is well-developed through her profession as a "chameleon actor" who channels victims' experiences, with her "rationally impulsive" attribute thoughtfully integrated in how she balances analytical observation with emotional immersion. Her motivation to solve cold cases by embodying victims shows clear purpose. However, we lack deeper insight into her personal stakes or history that would elevate her beyond her functional role in the story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively combines the cold case investigation with the protagonist's unique method of embodying victims. The narrative builds logically from setup to discovery with excellent cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves a satisfying arc despite brevity, with the hidden compartment discovery providing effective resolution. The only weakness is that the revelation feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through earlier clues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The post-petroleum world and reimagined Forbidden City create a richly atmospheric setting that brilliantly merges ancient architecture with futuristic purpose. The "sunlight through debris" motif works as both literal description and metaphor for uncovering truth. Sensory details like "fabric whispered secrets" and "golden fragments" of light establish immersive atmosphere that directly serves the story's themes of illuminating hidden truths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story creates powerful impact through its unique premise of performance as forensic tool and the emotional transformation of the protagonist into the victim. Strong imagery (particularly light motifs) reinforces themes of revelation and truth-finding. The narrative successfully balances procedural elements with emotional depth. While the story has strong metaphorical resonance, the dialogue-free approach limits some character dimensionality that could have further enriched the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story displays originality in its premise of embodied truth-seeking in a post-petroleum world. The writing avoids obvious AI markers like repetitive phrasing or inconsistent characterization. However, certain phrases like "anxious serenity" and "emotional geometry" feel slightly overwrought. The writing occasionally tilts toward purple prose ("gossamer threads of carefully constructed illusion") that, while thematically appropriate, sometimes draws attention to itself rather than serving the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous required elements into a cohesive whole without feeling contrived. The unique premise of physical embodiment as investigative technique gives the narrative distinctive appeal. While concise, the story delivers emotional impact and thoughtful worldbuilding. A few instances of overly ornate language are the main drawback in what is otherwise a compelling and well-structured short narrative that leaves readers with meaningful reflection on memory, truth, and embodied experience.</comment>
