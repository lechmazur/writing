<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus demonstrates a consistent dry wit, with moments like "that's certainly possible" establishing his personality. His transition from detached cataloguer to committed guardian shows growth, though his deeper psychology remains somewhat underdeveloped. The ghost dance interaction reveals his respect for tradition, but his internal conflict about accepting the lighthouse's call could have been explored more deeply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot creates a satisfying arc from Marcus's cataloguing to his transformation into guardian, with the confiscation task creating natural tension. The dance sequence effectively delivers the lighthouse's secrets, though the transition from antagonist (confiscator) to protector feels slightly rushed. The story achieves closure with Marcus's acceptance of his new role, tying back neatly to the opening list of names.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with tactile details like "damp paper" and "salt air" that immediately establish atmosphere. The ghostly presence creates a compelling supernatural dimension that enhances the core theme of tradition versus modernization. The bedroom's intimate setting effectively contrasts with the vast implied seascape beyond, creating a liminal space where past and present convincingly intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the frayed rope as a potent symbol for both deterioration and renewal. The dance sequence cleverly transforms exposition into action. While the theme of preserving tradition against bureaucratic erasure is well-developed, the emotional stakes could be heightened. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution with Marcus's transformation, though his decision lacks some psychological complexity that would elevate the piece further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its ghost dance mechanism for knowledge transfer and the lighthouse as literal and metaphorical beacon of tradition. The prose occasionally relies on familiar ghost story tropes ("a sudden chill filled the room"), but largely avoids predictable patterns. The frayed rope transforming itself feels slightly convenient rather than earned through narrative development. The emotional progression is rendered with subtlety rather than stated directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about tradition and obligation. The supernatural elements and maritime setting create a distinctive atmosphere that elevates the piece above formula. While the character transformation is compelling, the story would benefit from deeper exploration of Marcus's internal conflict. The ending effectively leaves readers with the sense of enduring commitment transcending bureaucratic limitations.</comment>
