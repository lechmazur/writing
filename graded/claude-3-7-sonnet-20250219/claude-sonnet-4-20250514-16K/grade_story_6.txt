<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cornelius's skepticism is well-established through both description ("practiced skepticism") and dialogue ("Just because I can't explain it doesn't mean I have to worship it"). His motivation to challenge Morrigan feels consistent with his character, though his emotional depth remains somewhat superficial within the constraints. His distinctly irreverent voice shines through his interactions with the supernatural, creating a compelling character foundation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot functions exceptionally well within the tight word count, establishing conflict, building to a climactic action with the slingshot, and providing resolution with appropriate emotional weight. The logic of using the dragon scale against the steam vent follows the story's internal rules elegantly. The circular structure—from Cornelius tracking Morrigan to outmaneuvering them—gives the narrative a satisfying completeness despite brevity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned factory setting is richly rendered with precise, evocative details (filtered sunlight, hissing vents, pneumatic mail system) that complement the magical elements. The juxtaposition of industrial decay with supernatural persistence creates a liminal space perfect for the confrontation. The disappearing ink factory brilliantly mirrors the theme of ephemerality versus permanence that underlies the conflict between mortal and immortal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the conflict between skepticism and magic to explore deeper themes about human ingenuity versus supernatural power. The ironic ending—where a skeptic uses magic to win while denying its existence—creates delightful narrative tension. The writing employs fresh imagery and metaphor ("teeth like broken glass") that elevates the prose. However, character motivations could have more emotional complexity to deepen the impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story presents innovative combinations of elements and fresh imagery, some phrases ("practiced skepticism," "reckless generosity born of pure spite") feel somewhat overworked. The dialogue sometimes edges toward predictable patterns for this type of fantasy confrontation. The premise of a skeptic fighting supernatural forces isn't entirely original, though the execution has distinctive elements. The consistent tone and unique imagery (particularly the factory imagery) elevate it above generic fantasy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story succeeds in integrating its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each component feels necessary rather than forced. The blend of industrial setting with magical elements creates a distinctive aesthetic, and the brevity feels appropriate rather than constraining. The central conflict resolves satisfyingly while leaving intriguing implications about the relationship between belief, magic, and reality. The final line provides both closure and philosophical resonance beyond the immediate story.</comment>
