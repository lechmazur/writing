<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lin's character lacks depth and development. The "rationally impulsive" attribute is merely stated rather than demonstrated through actions. The dual interests in acting and solving mysteries feel disconnected rather than integrated into a coherent personality. Lin remains a cipher throughout—we learn what Lin does but not who Lin is.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks coherence and forward momentum. The cold-case mystery is mentioned but never developed, and the "reproduce" action feels incidental rather than central. The performance that supposedly reveals truth happens offstage in a single sentence. The narrative presents disconnected elements without building meaningful cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic Chinese palace-theater setting has potential but remains underdeveloped. The "sunlight through debris" creates momentary atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic. The juxtaposition of theatrical space against barren landscape offers interesting contrast, but the world lacks specificity and lived-in quality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story fails to deliver emotional impact or thematic resonance. It tells rather than shows, repeatedly stating Lin's purpose without demonstrating it through action. The central conflict remains abstract, and the resolution is rushed and unearned. Literary devices feel superficial rather than integrated, with metaphors that don't extend beyond their initial statement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The prose exhibits hallmarks of AI generation: repetitive phrasing ("a sense of calm that belied the turmoil"), generic descriptions, and abrupt narrative jumps. Emotions are stated rather than evoked. The writing relies heavily on abstract concepts ("truth," "illusion") without grounding them in specific details. The ending defaults to clichéd statements about "the indomitable human spirit."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The story struggles to integrate its assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The narrative feels constructed around checking boxes rather than developing organically. While some elements (the setting, the doll's dress) show promise, they're not leveraged effectively. The brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, with the story rushing through potentially meaningful moments.</comment>
