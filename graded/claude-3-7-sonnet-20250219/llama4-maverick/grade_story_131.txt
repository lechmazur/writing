<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The aloof orphan's character is somewhat developed through their emotional journey, but their aloofness is more told than shown. Their motivation to transform fear into courage is clear, but their personality lacks distinctive traits beyond generic emotional struggles. The character remains rather flat, with reactions that feel predictable rather than revealing deeper complexities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot structure relies heavily on metaphor rather than concrete events. While there is a basic arc (cleaning garage → discovering objects → emotional transformation), the actual progression feels static. The gravitational anomaly is introduced but not meaningfully integrated into the plot's development. The story lacks genuine conflict or obstacles beyond vague emotional hurdles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates an intriguing backdrop that mirrors the character's emotional state, showing thoughtful integration of setting and theme. However, the garage itself lacks sensory specificity, and the anomaly's physical effects remain underdeveloped. The atmosphere effectively conveys introspection but would benefit from more concrete sensory details.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story relies excessively on explicit metaphors rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically. The stones-as-journey metaphor is heavy-handed, and emotional states are directly stated rather than revealed through action. While there's a clear thematic focus on courage and transformation, the execution lacks subtlety and fails to create genuine emotional resonance through concrete, specific moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several AI hallmarks: overly explicit metaphors, telling rather than showing emotions, and generic phrasing. The narrative progression feels algorithmic, with each paragraph following a predictable pattern of introducing an object then explaining its symbolic meaning. The text lacks a distinctive voice and relies on abstract emotional states rather than specific, nuanced human experiences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all assigned elements, it does so in a way that feels mechanical rather than organic. The narrative prioritizes explaining symbolic connections over creating a compelling experience. The brevity highlights rather than mitigates the lack of concrete detail and authentic emotional depth. The story reads more like an outline of themes than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
