<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as a "rattled exorcist" is mentioned but barely developed. Their "inwardly social" nature is briefly referenced but not meaningfully explored. The character lacks a distinct voice and emotional depth, with motivations stated rather than revealed through actions. The character feels more like a vehicle for the plot than a fully realized individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a basic mystery structure but feels rushed and underdeveloped. The puzzle-solving process is told rather than shown, with the solution appearing abruptly. While there is a beginning, middle and end, the transitions between these phases lack sufficient development. The cause-and-effect relationships are simplistic, with the protagonist solving puzzles without meaningful obstacles or setbacks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility creates an appropriately mysterious atmosphere with some sensory details (scent of old books, sandalwood). However, the setting remains largely undeveloped beyond surface-level description. The dance lesson timeframe feels disconnected from the main plot rather than integrated. The atmosphere has potential but relies more on telling than showing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional depth and meaningful conflict. The protagonist faces no significant obstacles or internal struggles. The writing relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with emotions and revelations stated directly rather than revealed through action or dialogue. The ending feels rushed and unearned, with vague references to "implications" and "possibilities" rather than concrete revelations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The writing exhibits numerous AI hallmarks: overly formal language, generic descriptions, stated rather than demonstrated emotions, and abrupt narrative jumps. The story relies on clich√©s about mysterious facilities and cryptic messages without subverting them. Phrases like "coy aggression" are repeated without clear meaning. The narrative lacks a distinctive voice and follows a predictable template without originality or surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates most assigned elements, they feel artificially inserted rather than organically integrated. The brevity results in telling rather than showing, with important developments summarized instead of experienced. The writing lacks depth and nuance, with a resolution that feels unearned. The story reads like a sketch rather than a complete narrative, failing to create meaningful connections between its elements.</comment>
