<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The swordsman's arrogance is established but inconsistently maintained, as it quickly transforms into humility without sufficient development. The "doubtfully confident" attribute feels contradictory rather than complex. His motivation to revive the calligraphy master's art is stated but not deeply explored, leaving his character feeling somewhat flat and his emotional journey too abrupt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks sufficient conflict and tension. The action of "authorizing" the revival of calligraphy is mentioned but not meaningfully integrated into the narrative structure. The story achieves a basic arc but feels rushed, with the calligraphy master's transformation occurring too easily after hearing one song, without meaningful obstacles or complications to overcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard is effectively established with sensory details like "the air was heavy with the scent of ink and forgotten dreams." The atmosphere of neglect and renewal works well with the concept of shackled potential. However, the setting remains somewhat static, serving more as backdrop than as an active element that evolves with the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with abstract statements about "harsh tenderness" and "delivering a spark" instead of concrete demonstrations. The central theme of artistic revival is clear but handled with excessive sentimentality. The ending feels predictable and lacks the complexity or surprise that would elevate the narrative beyond its straightforward message about unlocking potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The prose is consistently overwrought with phrases like "the brush dancing across the paper with a fluidity that had long been lost" and "a river breaking free from its shackles." The writing relies on clich√©d metaphors about light and darkness. The emotional progression feels algorithmic rather than organic, with the character's transformation following a predictable template without nuanced human complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all required elements, it does so in a manner that feels mechanical rather than organic. The prose is consistently purple, with excessive metaphors and flowery language that obscure rather than enhance the narrative. The brevity highlights rather than mitigates these issues, as the emotional transformations feel rushed and unearned within the limited space.</comment>
