<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit comes through effectively in her dialogue and internal thoughts. Her motivation—upholding vows others have broken—is clear and consistent. The character possesses a distinct voice that balances duty with weariness. However, some aspects of her relationship with the ghost remain underdeveloped within the word constraint, leaving questions about their shared history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the crossing off of the final name to initiate the story and creates a satisfying arc through the ghost's appearance, the rope repair, and the final dance. The confiscation action drives the narrative forward meaningfully. While the story achieves a sense of completeness, some causal relationships (particularly why the ghost appears now) could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with vivid sensory details—the salt and mildew smell, walls that groan, cold drafts hissing through cracks. The haunted lighthouse setting perfectly complements the themes of duty, isolation, and eroding promises. The physical decay of the lighthouse mirrors the erosion of vows, creating a cohesive metaphorical landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of duty, memory, and promises. Strong use of metaphor throughout ("walls groaning like a scorned lover") enhances the narrative. The volta dance serves as an effective central symbol that ties together the relationship, duty, and the physical act of knotting the rope. The ending leaves readers with a lingering emotional resonance about vows and memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates a distinctive style with fresh, specific metaphors and similes that avoid cliché. The handling of the ghost's appearance and the dance feels original rather than formulaic. Emotions are conveyed through action and atmosphere rather than direct statement. The story maintains consistent tone throughout, with no jarring shifts that would suggest AI generation. The language is evocative without becoming purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a haunting, impressionistic quality appropriate to the ghost story elements. The narrative leaves readers with lingering questions about duty, memory, and promises that transcend the explicit plot. The precision of language and imagery demonstrates significant craft.</comment>
