<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably tight and coherent. The action of igniting the geothermal core drives everything forward with clear causality.

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater city setting is rendered with extraordinary sensory detail—blueprints floating like jellyfish, bioluminescent ink, copper pipes echoing voices. The timeframe of "time's final ripple" creates urgency while maintaining dreamlike quality. The atmosphere of submersed grief perfectly complements both the physical setting and emotional landscape. The dictionary as conduit between truth and power is seamlessly integrated into this underwater bureaucracy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its metaphorical framework—heartbreak as literal fuel, truth as fire, grief as currency. The central conflict between duty and personal loss resolves in a cathartic moment that transforms vengeance into acceptance.

The final image of the dictionary closing as time carries away Elvan's whisper provides a haunting, satisfying conclusion.</comment>
