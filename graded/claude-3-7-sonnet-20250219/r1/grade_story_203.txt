<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The exorcist's stage fright creates a compelling internal conflict that manifests physically ("hands trembled") and thematically connects to their deeper struggle with inherited falsehoods. Their motivation to transform their family legacy is clear and consistent. The character demonstrates growth through their defiant act of repurposing the wildflowers, though their voice could be more distinctive in the limited dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with impressive coherence from setup to confrontation to resolution. The submerging action drives the character's internal journey effectively, and the story achieves a complete arc within its constraints. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the supernatural framework. The pacing accelerates appropriately during the confrontation but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orbital station with its debris field creates a perfect metaphorical landscape for the themes of inheritance and ghostly presence. The juxtaposition of cosmic vastness with intimate personal struggle is masterfully handled. Sensory details are vivid and purposefulâ€”the "sickly green" engines, the "scent of lavender," and the "scrape of metal on teeth" all contribute to the unsettling yet beautiful atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its layered metaphors and imagery. The wildflowers function brilliantly as both literal objects and symbols of transformation. The conflict between inherited burden and personal agency creates genuine tension. The ending offers both resolution and lingering questions about cycles of inheritance. The theme of reclaiming narrative from falsehood is powerfully conveyed through showing rather than telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates consistent stylistic control with fresh, unexpected metaphors ("its timbre the scrape of metal on teeth"). The story avoids predictable ghost story tropes by focusing on inheritance as both burden and potential. The emotional landscape feels authentically complex rather than stated. While occasionally verging on purple prose, the language generally serves the atmospheric requirements of the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, making them feel essential rather than imposed. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The narrative demonstrates creative thinking in its metaphorical connections between space debris, ghosts, and family legacy. The ending achieves both closure and openness, leaving the reader with the lingering image of transformation that resonates beyond the final line.</comment>
