<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost observer's character is well-developed through her connection to tradition and the lighthouse keeper who influenced her. Her motivation to preserve ancient traditions drives her actions consistently. The revelation that she was the first dancer adds meaningful depth. However, her emotional journey could be more nuanced, and her "voice" remains somewhat distant despite the intimate nature of her mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the whale's call and the whistle as catalysts, creating a coherent arc from the observer's inertia to her release. The connection between lighthouse, dancer, and whale forms a compelling narrative logic. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the transition between the whistle's journey and the dancer receiving it feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting brilliantly complements the themes of tradition and liminality. Sensory details like "salt-stained silence" and the storm mirroring the observer's restlessness create a richly atmospheric world. The juxtaposition of the ancient lighthouse with the distant modern stage creates effective tension, while the whale's presence connects these realms through sound and symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of tradition as "not a chain but a current." The metaphorical language is consistently strong, particularly in phrases like "tradition is not a corpse. It is a seed." The ending delivers a satisfying resolution while maintaining mystery. The central conflict between forgotten traditions and modernity is elegantly handled, though some metaphors could be more precisely developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its treatment of ghostly presence and tradition. The language avoids clich√©s and creates fresh imagery, particularly in describing the whistle's journey and the whale's call. However, some phrases like "brazen calm" appear twice, suggesting minor repetition. The emotional nuance is generally strong, though occasionally the prose becomes slightly ornate at the expense of clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The themes of tradition, memory, and connection across time are thoughtfully developed. The brevity feels purposeful rather than limiting. The lingering questions about tradition's nature and the relationship between past and present give the piece depth beyond its immediate narrative.</comment>
