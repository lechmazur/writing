<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wayward apothecary is exceptionally well-developed through her actions and motivations. Her grief for the lost cartographer drives her mission with the butterflies, creating a compelling emotional core. Her "unjustly fair" attribute manifests in her determination to spread truth despite consequences. The character possesses a distinct voice through her interactions with the captain and her relationship with the Morse code communications, revealing layers of determination and melancholy. Her use of remedies and poultices authentically connects to her apothecary identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the infection action as its driving force, with the apothecary's plan to spread truth through butterflies creating clear narrative momentum. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, moving from the apothecary's initial mission to the climactic transformation of the crew and submarine's descent. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the established world, though the final resolution feels slightly rushed. The unconventional love concept shapes the plot's direction beautifully, giving emotional weight to what might otherwise be merely fantastical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is masterfully rendered with specific, evocative details like "riveted glass," "copper pipes," and "condensation-slick plating." The timeframe between broken treaties creates a perfect backdrop for the apothecary's mission. The atmosphere of melancholy wonder—a "battered marvel" tone—permeates the narrative through sensory details like mechanical leviathans, phosphorescent pollen, and the sounds of pressure gauges shattering. The setting and the butterflies' migration create a meaningful juxtaposition between industrial decay and natural beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its layered metaphors and imagery. The butterflies serve as powerful symbols for both communication and transformation, while the Morse code represents connection across impossible distances. The central conflict between preservation of truth and established order is effectively established and resolved. The theme of love as a "virus" rather than a "contract" provides intellectual depth. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction through its message of connection despite loss. The prose occasionally verges on purple but generally maintains a poetic quality that enhances rather than distracts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its fusion of steampunk elements with the emotional core of lost love. The metaphors are generally fresh and specific, particularly the "glass dirigibles" and "parliamentary blue" ink. The emotional nuance is well-handled through showing rather than telling, especially in moments like the apothecary's laugh "like a pressure gauge shattering." While some phrases like "Love was not a contract. It was a virus." feel slightly formulaic in their epigrammatic quality, the overall narrative maintains a distinctive voice and avoids predictable patterns. The butterflies as carriers of truth is an inventive concept that elevates the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced, particularly the highlighter pen and Morse code which become central to the emotional throughline. The steampunk submarine setting creates a distinctive atmosphere that enhances the themes of communication and connection. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the narrative. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about truth, connection, and the persistence of love beyond death, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
