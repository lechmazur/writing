<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Milo's character is well-developed through his relationship with ghosts, his past, and his occupation. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests naturally in his actions and self-perception. His motivation to understand why "the dead clung to places they'd hated alive" feels authentic and drives his actions. However, some aspects of his character development happen too abruptly within the word constraint, particularly his shift from observer to active liberator.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Milo's stakeout to his encounter with the ghost to resolution. The narrative achieves a complete arc despite brevity, with the ghost's liberation providing satisfying closure. The connection between the dried flower crown, the ghost, and the drowned carnival creates a logical framework. However, the transition from the lab to the carousel pit feels slightly rushed, and some causal relationships could be more explicitly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a hauntingly effective backdrop that thematically resonates with preservation, impermanence, and memory. Sensory details are exceptional—the "brittle whisper of sea air," petals that "hit the ground as sea glass," and the "salt-scented mist" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The juxtaposition of sterile preservation with decay and haunting creates a rich tension that enhances the story's emotional impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—elevators as liminal spaces between worlds, sand castles as metaphors for impermanent memories, and flower crowns as connections between living and dead. The central theme of liberation through letting go emerges organically. The prose is lyrical without becoming purple, and the ending leaves a lingering emotional resonance. The only weakness is occasional overreliance on abstract concepts that could benefit from more concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its concept and execution. The integration of elevator repair and ghost-seeing feels fresh rather than formulaic. Metaphors like the ghost "crumbling like the castles under UV lights" are specific and evocative. The narrative maintains a consistent, distinctive voice throughout. The only elements that occasionally feel slightly artificial are some dialogue exchanges that serve exposition more than character development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative. The elements feel essential rather than forced, particularly the connection between the elevator technician's occupation and his ability to help spirits "descend" or move on. The brevity serves the story well, creating a dreamlike quality that enhances its ghostly subject matter. The lingering image of the flowerless crown left beside a half-built castle provides a powerful final note that extends beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
