<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nostalgic tailor is well-developed through his history, motivations, and physical details like "calloused fingers." His quest to transcend mortality is consistent with his character, and his past losses (wife, rebellion) provide compelling motivation. His relationship with Elara adds depth, though his emotional arc could be more nuanced in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from anticipation to confrontation to transcendence, with the mirror as an effective catalyst. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with the tailor's reassurance of Elara serving as a pivotal moment. The ending provides resolution while maintaining mystery. Some causal relationships could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck is vividly realized with "cogs," "steam," and "metal tendons." The storm provides both atmospheric tension and thematic resonance. Sensory details are exceptional—the mirror's hum, lightning fracturing the sky, and the "luminous thread" at the climax. The setting and timeframe perfectly complement the concept of parallel lives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the mirror as both literal object and metaphor for possibility. The central conflict between accepting fate and transcending it creates genuine tension. Literary devices are strong, particularly the imagery of "stitching constellations" and "light remained—a luminous thread." The ending achieves emotional impact through its ambiguity—is this transcendence or delusion?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of steampunk elements with existential themes. Language is generally fresh, avoiding clichés. Some metaphors are particularly striking ("storms always dredged truths too raw for daylight"). However, certain phrases ("caged beast," "fractured the sky") lean toward familiar territory, and the emotional arc occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than demonstrated ones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The mirror serves as both plot device and thematic centerpiece, while the steampunk setting enhances rather than distracts. The ending achieves poignancy through its ambiguity. Some transitions between scenes could be smoother, and certain emotional beats would benefit from more development.</comment>
