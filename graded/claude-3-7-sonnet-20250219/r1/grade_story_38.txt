<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is exceptionally well-realized through her relationship with her environment and the ghost. Her evolution from collector to penitent shows genuine character growth. Her insomnia serves as both literal condition and metaphor for her spiritual unrest. The character's voice maintains a consistent poetic sensibility while showing meaningful transformation. Only slight weakness is in the somewhat underdeveloped motivation for her initial collection of the botanical samples.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with remarkable coherence from haunting to understanding to resolution. The narrative arc of realization, atonement, and transformation feels complete despite brevity. The "eliminate" action drives the plot effectively by subverting expectations—elimination becomes return rather than destruction. The pacing expertly balances exposition, conflict, and resolution with a denouement that feels earned rather than rushed. Particularly strong is how the subway transitions serve as structural markers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted attic is rendered with extraordinary sensory precision—ink stains, amber jars, frantic cursive. The juxtaposition of subway transitions with attic hauntings creates a compelling rhythm. The atmosphere shifts organically from unsettling to melancholic to peaceful, mirroring the protagonist's journey. The botanical elements are seamlessly integrated with the supernatural, creating a unique haunting that feels both fresh and believable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling craft elevates this piece. The metaphor of plants as displaced souls creates profound resonance. The subtext about colonization, theft, and repatriation adds significant depth. Phrases like "refugee camp" and "relearning silence" carry powerful emotional weight. The ending achieves a delicate balance of resolution and lingering mystery. The story demonstrates masterful "showing" through specific details like "cemetery dirt under his nails" rather than explaining emotions directly. The theme of reconciliation through return rather than conquest is subtly but powerfully conveyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its approach to the ghost story genre. The botanical-spiritual connection feels fresh and purposeful rather than gimmicky. The prose maintains consistent poetic quality without becoming purple or self-indulgent. Metaphors like "petals unfurled into apologies" and "stems bent like penitent spines" are startlingly original. The emotional progression feels authentically human in its complexity and ambivalence. Only minor weakness is occasional overreliance on sentence fragments, which sometimes feels stylistically affected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced. The brevity serves the story's ethereal quality, creating a dreamlike compression that enhances rather than limits. The narrative leaves readers with profound questions about restitution, forgiveness, and healing. The botanical metaphor extends throughout without becoming heavy-handed. Most impressively, the story manages to be both accessible and layered, offering immediate emotional impact alongside deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
