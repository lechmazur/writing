<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The woodsman's character is well-developed through his grief, regret, and quest for redemption. His motivation to map railways as a promise to his deceased daughter creates emotional depth. The hairbrush serves as a powerful physical manifestation of his loss. However, his backstory regarding his wife feels somewhat rushed and could benefit from more nuanced development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves effectively from grief to potential spiritual connection to acceptance, with the short-circuit serving as a compelling inciting incident. The water tower discovery creates a satisfying revelation that ties to the protagonist's past. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, though the supernatural/technological elements (the daughter's voice) could be more clearly defined as either metaphorical or literal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates a unique, evocative setting that brilliantly merges technology with nature, perfectly complementing the story's themes of connection beyond death. The abandoned water tower and railways enhance the atmosphere of forgotten things being rediscovered. Sensory details like static, echoes, and metallic scrapes create a hauntingly immersive environment that bridges the physical and metaphysical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of grief, regret, and potential redemption. The hairbrush and photo serve as powerful symbols, while the railway mapping becomes a metaphor for charting one's emotional journey. The ambiguity about whether the daughter's voice is supernatural or psychological adds compelling depth. The final image of measuring echoes in miles rather than seconds provides a resonant conclusion, though some metaphors occasionally border on being too explicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of a radio wave garden and the integration of technology with grief. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with specific, meaningful details and consistent characterization. However, certain phrases like "despairing cheer" and "electromagnetic chorus" feel slightly overwrought, and the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable trajectory of loss to acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about grief, connection, and redemption. The technical elements (radio waves, mapping) serve the emotional core rather than feeling forced. The ambiguity about whether the daughter's voice is real or imagined adds depth, and the ending leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of connection beyond death. Despite minor stylistic issues, the story achieves remarkable emotional resonance within its constraints.</comment>
