<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The brewer has a distinct voice with his sardonic muttering and scoffing, but his motivation remains somewhat murky. While his connection to brewing "resilience into ale" and "fermenting defiance" hints at his values, the transition from brewer to reluctant hero lacks sufficient development. His actions seem driven more by the plot's needs than by clearly established character traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc—from approaching the mansion to confronting the specter to resolution—but suffers from rushed pacing in the final third. The mirror shard's transformation from talisman to lens comes abruptly, and the resolution feels somewhat deus ex machina. The connection between the protest outside and the mansion's supernatural elements remains underdeveloped, creating logical gaps in the narrative's cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard is vividly rendered with "frostbitten grass" and "grave-mist," creating a palpable atmosphere of dread. The sensory details—particularly the visual elements of the discolored staircase and the tactile sensation of the mirror shard—effectively immerse the reader. The protest's "discordant hymn" threading through "skeletal trees" creates a compelling juxtaposition of the supernatural setting with sociopolitical context.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story employs effective metaphors and imagery, particularly in the mirror's reflections and the staircase's changing colors. However, the central conflict remains somewhat nebulous, and the thematic exploration of authenticity versus performance ("preached authenticity between pints") feels underdeveloped. The ending, while poetic, doesn't fully satisfy because the stakes and purpose of the brewer's mission were never clearly established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>While the prose shows moments of originality with fresh metaphors like "a throat raw from screaming into voids," it occasionally veers into purple territory with phrases like "the darkness pooling like ink in a well." The narrative relies on supernatural horror tropes without fully subverting them. The emotional arc lacks nuance, with the brewer's transformation from cynical to determined happening too abruptly to feel authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements into a cohesive narrative, but struggles with clarity of purpose. The symbolic relationship between the protest, the mirror, and the mansion remains intriguing but underdeveloped. While the prose has moments of lyrical strength, the story's ambiguity sometimes feels less like intentional mystery and more like conceptual vagueness. The ending gesture toward hope feels earned but incompletely realized.</comment>
