<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aria's selflessness is consistently demonstrated through her sacrifice for the whales, trading her violin for archives and ultimately sacrificing herself. Her motivation to preserve the whales' songs is clear and drives every action. The character's relationship with the wind chimes reveals her dedication to mastering an alien language of vibration. However, we could benefit from more insight into what initially drove her obsession beyond the stated facts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from discovery (whales heading toward black hole) to action (recalibrating the beacon) to resolution (saving the whales at personal cost). The lunging action serves as a pivotal moment that drives the climax. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships throughout. The pacing effectively balances exposition with action, creating tension that builds to Aria's sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details—groaning hull, wind chimes on corroded bulkheads—that create a vivid atmosphere of beautiful decay. The "centuries of longing" timeframe infuses the narrative with melancholy weight. The cosmic setting perfectly complements the themes of sacrifice and preservation, while the black hole provides both literal and metaphorical gravity to Aria's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of sacrifice for something greater than oneself. Rich imagery (fraying bioluminescent trails, vinyl's warped pulses) creates a sensory experience that enhances the narrative's emotional weight. The ending resonates with poignant satisfaction as Aria's sacrifice ensures the whales' survival. The central theme of preservation transcending individual existence emerges organically from the narrative elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its cosmic whale migration concept and the unique method of sonic communication. The prose occasionally verges on purple ("savage grace of desperation," "duet of defiance") but generally serves the ethereal tone. While some phrases feel slightly overwrought, the consistent style and emotional authenticity prevent it from feeling formulaic. The narrative maintains a distinctive voice throughout with fresh metaphors and specific sensory details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The cosmic setting, musical elements, and themes of sacrifice blend seamlessly to create a narrative greater than the sum of its parts. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying necessary weight. The lingering image of whale migrations outliving Aria provides emotional resonance that extends beyond the narrative's conclusion.</comment>
