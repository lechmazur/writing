<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's character is exceptionally well-developed within the constraints. Her identity struggle as "Jonas Hale's girl" versus finding her own path feels authentic and deeply motivated. Her relationship with her father's ghost reveals layers of complexity—respect, resentment, and ultimately liberation. The wreck-diver ghost whisperer attribute shapes her actions organically rather than feeling imposed. Her decision to leave for Arizona demonstrates meaningful character evolution, though her initial motivations could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot moves with remarkable coherence from Mara's search for meaning in her father's letter to her ultimate liberation. The amber discovery serves as an effective catalyst, and the ghost encounter provides necessary exposition without feeling contrived. The story achieves a complete arc—from being trapped in her father's legacy to breaking free—with satisfying resolution. The "between the lines" revelation works brilliantly as both literal and metaphorical guidance. Only minor pacing issues in the middle section prevent a higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creates a hauntingly perfect backdrop that mirrors the story's themes of decay, nostalgia, and rebirth. Sensory details are exceptional—peeling clown murals, Atlantic wind, cracked plaster ducks—creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The contrast between the drowning coastal setting and the Arizona desert Mara chooses powerfully reinforces her transformation. The carnival's collapse into dunes as she leaves creates a masterful visual metaphor for letting go.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates remarkable craft through its layered symbolism—the trapped mayfly paralleling Mara's own imprisonment in her father's legacy, the amber representing preserved but stagnant memory, the thawing heart metaphor threading throughout. The final image of dreaming "not of anchors, but of wings" delivers profound thematic resonance. The story skillfully balances showing versus telling, with emotional states conveyed through physical sensations and meaningful actions rather than explicit statements. The subtext about identity and legacy elevates this beyond a simple ghost story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its approach to familiar themes of grief and identity. The prose avoids AI-typical patterns, with fresh, specific metaphors ("her parents dancing between popcorn carts, young and reckless, before grief iced him") and consistent voice throughout. The mayfly-in-amber metaphor feels inventive rather than formulaic. Occasional moments of slightly overwrought language ("Wind howled through the ruins, carrying salt and the mayfly") and one or two predictable emotional beats prevent a perfect score, but overall the writing feels genuinely human in its imperfections and insights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced, particularly the amber with insect, the carnival setting, and the thawing heart concept. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying necessary weight. The story demonstrates creative thinking in how it connects the wreck-diving profession to emotional themes of being submerged in the past. Most impressively, it leaves the reader with lingering questions about identity and legacy that transcend the specific narrative.</comment>
