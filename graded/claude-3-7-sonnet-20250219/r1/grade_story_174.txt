<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to complete her mentor's unfinished work is compelling and consistent. Her character is shaped by her theoretical creativity, shown through her ability to see connections between frost patterns and chemical formulae. However, we lack deeper insight into her emotional landscape beyond her dedication to her mentor, which prevents a perfect score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from the protagonist's discovery of patterns to the climactic moment of creating the special firework. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with the augmentation action driving the narrative forward. The cause-effect relationships are logical, and the resolution provides satisfying closure while opening new possibilities.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hidden waterfall library is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details—moss-slick stairs, bioluminescent fungi, glacial walls. The ephemeral timeframe creates urgency and is physically manifested in the frost crystallizing on sleeves and the library's impending closure at dawn. The atmosphere perfectly supports both the character's quest and the story's themes of transience and preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of metaphor and imagery, particularly in how frost patterns become maps for understanding time. The emotional impact is significant, especially in the silent explosion that creates a bridge between past and present. The theme of completing unfinished work and finding closure resonates deeply, and the ending leaves the reader with a sense of both resolution and new beginnings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, some phrases like "brittle as forgotten promises" and "a compass, not an anchor" feel slightly formulaic. The handling of time as "a river with too many tributaries" is fresh, but occasional moments of purple prose ("luminous trees—roots in the present, branches in the past") detract from the otherwise authentic narrative voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, mirroring the ephemeral nature of the library itself. The lingering image of the gold-flecked leaf and the protagonist walking toward "the next horizon" provides emotional resonance beyond the explicit narrative. Minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent a higher score.</comment>
