<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's impulsive, whimsical nature is consistently portrayed through her cartwheeling, dancing across the courtyard, and confrontational approach to the curator. Her motivation to restore her family's musical legacy is clear and drives her actions. However, her character could benefit from more internal conflict or complexity beyond her determined optimism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Lyra's arrival at the fortress to her confrontation with the curator and the resolution through music. The shooting stars effectively drive the narrative forward, creating a clear timeline and magical mechanism. The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with the musical reconciliation providing satisfying closure to the historical wrong.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with the ruined fortress and waterfall setting. The crimson-streaked sky, moss-slick stairs, and moonlit courtyard create vivid imagery that enhances the magical realism. The dusk shadows transitioning to midnight and dawn effectively frame the timeframe, while the waterfall serves both as physical setting and metaphorical instrument in the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses musical metaphors throughout, creating a cohesive theme of harmony and reconciliation. The transformation of the music sheet, the curator dissolving into notes, and the waterfall's roar becoming a C-sharp demonstrate strong symbolic storytelling. The emotional impact is clear, though the resolution feels slightly rushed despite the effective use of showing rather than telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some metaphors ("spectral fingers," "emotional inheritance") feel somewhat familiar. The premise of musical reconciliation with ghosts isn't entirely original, though the execution through astronomical alignment adds freshness. The prose occasionally becomes ornate ("cerulean flames"), but generally maintains a consistent style with specific sensory details that ground the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear emotional arc. The musical and astronomical elements complement each other naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity works well for this magical moment, though some transitions between scenes feel compressed. The lingering image of the waterfall humming the story provides a resonant conclusion that extends beyond the narrative.</comment>
