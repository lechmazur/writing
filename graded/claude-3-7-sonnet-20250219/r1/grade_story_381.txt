<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The necromancer's character is well-developed through her interactions with Jarek and her dedication to mapping the caves. Her motivation to "map the fractures before they consume us all" reveals depth and purpose. The baseball cap serves as both characterization and symbolic anchor. However, we could benefit from more insight into her emotional state beyond determination—what personal stakes drive her beyond duty?</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from mapping ritual to earthquake to resolution, with the necromancer's domination of the cave's chaos driving the narrative forward. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, though the final stakes ("what comes next") remain somewhat ambiguous. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the established supernatural framework.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building merges the crystalline cave setting with temporal anomalies and cinematic projections. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful—the hum of stones, luminous quartz crunching underfoot, time pooling like mercury. The atmosphere perfectly supports the "futuristic nostalgia" tone through the juxtaposition of necromancy with holographic projections and classic film references.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its exploration of loss, duty, and the weight of impossible choices. The metaphor of mapping fractured timelines works both literally and symbolically. The dialogue between the necromancer and Jarek's projection reveals their relationship without exposition. The ending creates effective tension between resolution and anticipation. The theme of preserving possibility amid temporal chaos emerges organically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of necromancy with temporal science fiction. The writing avoids clichés and creates fresh imagery ("time pooled like mercury"). Character emotions are shown through actions rather than stated. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout. Minor weaknesses include occasional moments of purple prose ("a sound like resolve itself") and some predictable elements in the relationship dynamic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The necromancer's mapping of temporal anomalies serves as both literal plot and metaphor for confronting difficult choices. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about sacrifice and duty that extend beyond its immediate narrative.</comment>
