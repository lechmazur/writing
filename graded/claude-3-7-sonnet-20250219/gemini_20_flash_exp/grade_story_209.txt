<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-established through his grief and self-deception. His woodsman identity feels somewhat peripheral, but his emotional journey from denial to acknowledgment is compelling. The hairbrush as a relic connects meaningfully to his past. However, his specific backstory remains vague, and we lack concrete details about what exactly he lost, which limits full emotional investment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively moves from self-deception to revelation, with the short-circuit moment serving as a powerful turning point. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with the radio wave measurement serving as both literal action and metaphor for emotional processing. The connection between mapping railways and mapping grief creates thematic coherence, though the exact nature of his loss remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and abandoned water tower create a distinctive, haunting atmosphere that perfectly mirrors Elias's emotional state. The setting functions as both literal space and metaphorical landscape of grief. Sensory details like the humming antennae and groaning metal effectively immerse the reader. The juxtaposition of technological abandonment with personal loss creates a resonant emotional environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story skillfully uses the mapping metaphor throughout, creating layers of meaning between physical and emotional landscapes. The hairbrush as memento mori and the radio waves as emotional frequencies demonstrate strong symbolic thinking. The narrative effectively "shows" Elias's emotional journey through his actions rather than telling. The ending achieves poignancy without sentimentality, offering cautious hope without erasing the reality of loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls, certain elements feel slightly manufactured. The radio wave/grief metaphor, while effective, occasionally strains credibility in execution. Some descriptions ("despairing cheer") feel more conceptually clever than organically developed. The story's emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern of denial-revelation-acceptance without truly surprising turns. However, the integration of technical elements with emotional content shows creative thinking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole with the grief metaphor binding everything together. The emotional journey feels authentic despite some conceptual stretching. The brevity works well for this character study, though it limits full exploration of the backstory. The lingering sense of cautious hope provides satisfying closure while acknowledging ongoing grief. Overall, it's a thoughtful exploration of loss with occasional moments of genuine insight.</comment>
