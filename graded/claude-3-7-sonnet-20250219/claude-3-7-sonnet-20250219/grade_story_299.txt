<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliza's characterization as an "unsure champion" is established well through her initial hesitation and gradual empowerment. Her connection to her grandmother provides motivation, though her transformation from uncertainty to leadership feels somewhat accelerated. Her artistic identity informs her solution, creating coherence between character and action, but her internal conflict could be more deeply explored beyond the surface-level hesitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from problem (development threat) to solution (art installation) with clear cause-effect relationships. The "interconnected paths" method emerges organically from Eliza's artistic background. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the constraints, though the developers' capitulation feels somewhat rushed and idealistic. The transformation from individual uncertainty to collective action creates effective narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details—church bells, fleeting sunlight, white precipice. The atmosphere of "cheerful gloom" manifests effectively in the contrast between artists' banter and looming clouds. The amber brooch connects meaningfully to both setting and character history. The environment feels lived-in and authentic, with the cliff itself becoming a character in the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the amber brooch as a symbol that connects past and present, personal and communal. The theme of preservation through creation rather than confrontation resonates emotionally. The narrative shows rather than tells Eliza's transformation. However, the resolution feels somewhat idealistic and simplified—the developers' immediate reconsideration lacks the complexity and resistance that would add tension. The grandmother's story about imperfect love creates thematic resonance but could be more fully integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers like repetitive phrasing or abrupt topic shifts, it follows a somewhat predictable environmental preservation narrative arc. The resolution relies on the somewhat clichéd trope of art triumphing over commerce without exploring the complexities such conflicts typically entail. The amber brooch as symbol is effective but occasionally overemphasized. The emotional progression feels slightly compressed, with Eliza's transformation happening without significant obstacles or setbacks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The chalk cliff setting, amber brooch, and preservation theme work particularly well together. The narrative balances exposition and action effectively within the word constraint. While the resolution feels somewhat idealistic, the story leaves readers with a satisfying sense of place and purpose. The grandmother's influence creates emotional depth that elevates the environmental conflict beyond mere politics.</comment>
