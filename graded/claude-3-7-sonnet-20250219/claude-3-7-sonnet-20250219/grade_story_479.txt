<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morgana Blackwood is well-developed as a glamorous undertaker with a distinct personality. Her connection to family tradition and the weight of her responsibility create clear motivation. Her contradictory feelings of "professional triumph and existential sadness" reveal psychological depth. However, her character could be further enriched through more specific personal conflicts or vulnerabilities beyond her professional identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively integrates the concept of digital afterlife preparation with the physical ritual of embalming. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraintsâ€”from searching for the right digital profile to completing the connection ritual. The brass measuring tape's supernatural elongation serves as both literal and metaphorical plot device. The cause-effect relationship between the ritual components is logically established and maintains coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the digital realm (Social Network Archive) with the traditional funeral parlor creates a compelling atmosphere. Sensory details like "the soft whirring" of the paint mixer, "heels clicking against the polished floor," and the visual of the brass tape "coiled like a serpent" effectively immerse the reader. The setting perfectly supports the story's exploration of the intersection between digital afterlife and physical death.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of death, digital legacy, and the tension between tradition and modernity. The measuring tape serves as a powerful symbol connecting physical and digital realms. The narrative prompts reflection on our digital footprints outliving our physical bodies. While the emotional impact is strong, the story could benefit from more subtext and less direct explanation of the ritual's significance to achieve greater literary sophistication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story presents an original concept in the "Digital Afterlife Preparation" ritual. The writing avoids most AI-typical patterns, with consistent tone and style throughout. However, some phrases like "jubilant surge" and "existential sadness" tell rather than show emotions. The description of Morgana as "the most glamorous undertaker" feels somewhat on-the-nose rather than revealed through nuanced characterization. The concept is fresh, but execution occasionally relies on direct statements rather than subtler implications.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The concept of connecting digital and physical death creates a memorable premise with philosophical undertones. The brevity works well for this glimpse into Morgana's world and profession. While some elements could be more subtly incorporated, the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking and leaves the reader with lingering questions about digital immortality.</comment>
