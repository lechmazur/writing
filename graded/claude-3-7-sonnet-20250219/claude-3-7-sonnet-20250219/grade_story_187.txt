<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stoic wanderer's character is well-established through consistent actions and dialogue that reflect his determination. His motivation to help his village is clear and compelling. His stoicism manifests naturally in his "steady voice despite trembling hands" and his willingness to stand his ground. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into his emotional journey beyond the final paragraph's mention of burden lifting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from confrontation to resolution with excellent cause-and-effect relationships. The wanderer's arrival, revelation of the floorboard, and negotiation with the instructor create a complete narrative arc. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the imposed knowledge conflict driving the plot forward naturally. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's familiar training ground is vividly realized through specific details like "cats with too-knowing eyes" and "ravens with metallic feathers." The atmosphere of arcane knowledge and power dynamics is palpable. The setting perfectly complements both the action and the concept of preserved knowledge. The timing—as the instructor erases crucial knowledge—creates dramatic tension that enhances the wanderer's mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of knowledge preservation versus earned wisdom. The central conflict between institutional control and personal need creates genuine tension. Memorable imagery like the cloth that "absorbs more than just chalk dust" adds depth. The resolution satisfies without being simplistic. The subtext about who controls knowledge and at what cost elevates this beyond a simple confrontation narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story largely avoids clichés and formulaic writing. The instructor's "mesmerizingly bland" appearance that causes eyes to slide away is a fresh approach to depicting magical beings. The metaphor of the instructor's voice as "brash tenderness" that reminds the wanderer of "his mother's calloused hands" shows nuanced emotional writing. However, some phrases like "power crackled between teacher and intruder" verge on fantasy tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion. The floorboard, familiar training ground, and concept of necessary lies feel essential rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused narrative about knowledge preservation and the cost of learning. The ending leaves readers with the satisfying tension between the wanderer's immediate relief and the "heavier but more hopeful burden" ahead.</comment>
