<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed as a dry-witted sentinel with clear motivation. His relationship with Marianne reveals depth through their dancing partnership and his conflicted duty. His voice is distinct in dialogue ("Promises erode..."), though we could benefit from more insight into his emotional journey before the final ritual. His actions align consistently with his established duty as sentinel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and effective, with the confiscation of Marianne's anchor driving the narrative forward. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, moving from Elias's contemplation to the final dance and resolution. The cause-effect relationship between Marianne's presence and the entity's approach creates logical tension. The pacing expertly balances exposition and action, culminating in the emotionally resonant final waltz.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details ("storm rage against the glass," "creaking floorboards"). The atmosphere perfectly complements the concept of eroding promises, with the physical erosion of the cliff mirroring the emotional themes. The rope as object connects meaningfully to both setting and ritual. The storm outside creates palpable tension that enhances the intimate farewell dance within.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its bittersweet farewell dance and Elias's tears. Rich subtext exists in the parallel between physical erosion and eroding promises. The central conflict between duty and attachment is elegantly established and resolved. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in the dance sequence. The ending delivers emotional resonance while fulfilling the narrative promise, leaving readers with the poignant image of Elias's "heart as frayed as the rope in his hands."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fresh take on lighthouse hauntings and the unusual relationship between keeper and ghost. The metaphor of erosion is consistently and effectively applied throughout. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and avoids purple prose while still achieving lyrical moments. The emotional resonance feels earned rather than stated. Some phrases like "reckless precision" feel slightly forced, but overall the writing shows distinctive style and avoids AI-typical patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a focused emotional experience. The creative combination of lighthouse keeper, ghost, and mysterious entity demonstrates imaginative thinking. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the entity and emotional resonance about sacrifice and duty, suggesting depth beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
