<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleni's timidity is well-established and consistent throughout, shaping her actions while allowing for growth. Her motivation to fulfill her promise to Thalia drives the narrative coherently. However, the character could benefit from more specific internal conflicts or contradictions to make her development from timid to confident feel more earned rather than situational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with logical progression from Eleni's promise to her fulfillment of it. The scoreboard consultation serves as an effective plot device that connects past to present. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the transition from collecting stories to the final tapestry reveal could use slightly more development to strengthen the resolution's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The repurposed Greek temple creates a powerful symbolic setting that enhances the themes of transformation and preservation. Sensory details like dust motes in flashlight beams and moonlight through stained glass effectively establish atmosphere. The juxtaposition of ancient architecture with industrial decline creates a rich temporal layering that serves the story's themes exceptionally well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of community resilience, historical preservation, and personal courage. The tapestry serves as both literal object and powerful metaphor for collective memory. The narrative shows rather than tells Eleni's transformation, and the final scene creates genuine emotional resonance. The subtext about reclaiming narrative control from industrial forces adds meaningful depth, though some metaphors could be more original.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, with consistent characterization and natural progression. However, phrases like "seraphic seamstress" and "scattered harmony of voices" feel somewhat ornate compared to the otherwise grounded prose. The emotional arc is authentic, though the resolution comes slightly too easily. The concept of weaving stories into literal fabric shows creative originality in connecting the assigned elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a focused narrative with emotional impact. The central metaphor of weaving stories into a tapestry effectively unifies the various elements while leaving readers with meaningful reflections on community, memory, and resilience. Some minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent it from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
