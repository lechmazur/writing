<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dr. Swarm is distinctively characterized through her six voices and compound eyes, creating a memorable presence. Mercer's trauma and attachment issues are effectively conveyed through his relationship with the charger plug and Budapest memories. However, their motivations could be more deeply explored, and Mercer's character feels somewhat generic compared to the more distinctive Dr. Swarm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the candle wax divination to reveal Mercer's trauma and prepare him for his mission. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from psychological assessment to breakthrough. The connection between Budapest's bridge and tomorrow's mission creates meaningful stakes, though the specific nature of the mission remains somewhat vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The secret agent facility setting is well-integrated with the supernatural therapy session, creating an intriguing blend of spy thriller and psychological fantasy. The night-time setting enhances the intimate, revelatory atmosphere. Sensory details like the dripping wax, night air, and synchronous voices effectively build a distinctive mood that supports the story's themes of memory and revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the candle wax as both plot device and metaphor for memory retrieval, creating layers of meaning. The central conflict of confronting past trauma is clear and resolved satisfyingly. The theme of facing the past to move forward is well-executed. However, some dialogue feels slightly expository, and the emotional impact could be heightened with more showing of Mercer's internal struggle rather than stating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist concept is original, but some phrasing feels formulaic ("her collective consciousness drawing from thousands of therapy sessions simultaneously"). The story avoids major clich√©s but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The wax-reading concept is creative, though the spy-with-trauma premise is familiar. The writing maintains consistent tone but could benefit from more specific, unique details to distinguish it from similar psychological thrillers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its unusual elements into a cohesive narrative with clear purpose. The hive-mind therapist and wax-reading method feel integral rather than forced. The brevity works well for this focused therapy session, though some elements (like the charger plug's significance) could be more fully developed. The story leaves readers with the satisfying sense of a character facing his demons, though a more specific hint about the upcoming mission would strengthen the ending's impact.</comment>
