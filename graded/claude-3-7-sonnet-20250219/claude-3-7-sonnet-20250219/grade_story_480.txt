<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's character as a social media exorcist is well-established with clear motivations. Her professional burnout and curiosity drive her actions consistently. The receipt serves as both a practical tool and symbolic representation of her journey. However, we could benefit from more insight into her emotional state beyond professional curiosityâ€”her internal conflict feels somewhat underdeveloped despite the strong conceptual foundation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds tension from Mira's initial scrolling to her final transformation from exorcist to initiate. The narrative maintains coherence through the receipt as a connecting device and the infiltration as the driving action. The story achieves a complete arc within the constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The revelation that her clients were both victims and perpetrators creates an effective twist that recontextualizes earlier elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall with its concentric tables and altar of obsolete technology creates a vivid, unsettling atmosphere that perfectly complements the digital-mystical concept. The contrast between the dark exterior and flickering candlelight establishes immediate tension. The transformation of the space into a techno-ritual setting effectively merges the digital with the occult, creating a unique atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of digital haunting and human connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of digital connection, the blurred line between victim and perpetrator, and the human desire for meaning in technological spaces. The central metaphor of digital hauntings works on multiple levels. The ending creates a powerful moment of transformation and revelation. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the "indifferent enthusiasm" of the participants, which could be more effectively demonstrated through specific behaviors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "social media exorcist" and "digital hauntings" shows originality, avoiding common tropes in tech-focused fiction. The writing maintains consistent tone and style throughout. However, some descriptions like "quietly loud presence" and "indifferent enthusiasm" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient explanation of this paradox. The story occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific sensory details or actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that explores digital connection and alienation. The concept of digital hauntings serves as both literal plot device and metaphor for social media's impact. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a sense of a larger world beyond what's shown. The final transformation leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of these digital hauntings and Mira's future, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
