<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed through his artistic connection to cosmic elements he's never seen and his relationship with the notepad's confessions. His motivation to seek the theoretical habitat is consistent with his character as someone who blurs boundaries between reality and imagination. The "fiercely gentle" attribute shapes his approach to art and his ultimate leap. However, we could benefit from more insight into his pre-station life to understand why he's so willing to abandon Earth.</comment>
