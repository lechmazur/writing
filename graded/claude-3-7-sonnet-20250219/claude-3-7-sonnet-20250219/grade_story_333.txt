<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliza's character as a sincere rebel is established clearly through her actions and motivations. Her dedication to preserving traditions stems from genuine conviction rather than mere defiance, which creates a believable character foundation. However, her personality lacks nuance and deeper development—we understand what drives her but don't get enough insight into her complexities or internal conflicts beyond her mission. Her dialogue is somewhat generic, lacking a truly distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with logical progression from Eliza's entrance to her discovery of the hidden chamber. The action of theorizing connects well to the plot's resolution. The story achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints, with the sticky note serving as an effective plot device that ties beginning to end. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and convenient, with the ghost's immediate cooperation undermining potential tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage setting is richly rendered with sensory details that create a palpable atmosphere—the damp stone walls, flickering lantern, cold drafts, and whispering voices effectively immerse the reader. The "between storms" timeframe creates natural tension and urgency. The supernatural elements blend seamlessly with the physical setting, creating a cohesive world where the haunting feels integral rather than superimposed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension and creates a compelling atmosphere, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing Eliza's emotions. While there's a clear theme about preserving history against modernization, the conflict resolution comes too easily. The ghost's immediate cooperation diminishes potential dramatic tension. The final message on the sticky note feels somewhat heavy-handed rather than allowing the theme to emerge organically through the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story contains several formulaic elements, particularly in its portrayal of the supernatural encounter and the convenient discovery of exactly what the protagonist needs. Phrases like "terror clawing at her throat" and "the bitterness in her voice softening into determination" read as generic emotional descriptors. The ghost's behavior follows predictable patterns for helpful spirit guides. While the premise has potential originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of academic preservation versus modernization without offering fresh perspectives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The haunted passage setting and preservation theme work particularly well together. However, the resolution comes too easily, undermining the established stakes. While the atmosphere is effectively rendered, character development and thematic exploration remain somewhat surface-level. The story creates an intriguing scenario but doesn't fully capitalize on its potential for deeper meaning or emotional resonance.</comment>
