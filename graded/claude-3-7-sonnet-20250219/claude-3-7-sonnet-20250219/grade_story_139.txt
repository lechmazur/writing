<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brother Tenzin's character is well-developed through his stubborn determination and internal conflict. His motivation to seek justice while maintaining spiritual integrity creates compelling tension. The flute's tooth marks cleverly connect to his method and mission. However, his voice lacks some distinctiveness, and his emotional journey could be more nuanced beyond the brief moment of doubt reflected in the gondola window.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively balances revenge with redemption, creating a satisfying arc within the constraints. The tooth mark analysis method drives the narrative forward logically, connecting past to present. The story achieves completeness with clear beginning (arrival), middle (revelation), and end (resolution through music rather than violence). The pacing effectively builds tension toward the ceremonial confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Himalayan monastery setting perfectly complements both the spiritual themes and the long-buried secret. The aerial gondola creates immediate atmospheric tension, suspended between earth and sky like Tenzin between vengeance and enlightenment. Sensory details like the misty peaks, golden spires catching light, and the creaking gondola create immersive atmosphere that enhances the themes of illumination versus darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively transforms a revenge tale into a meditation on justice and redemption. The flute as both evidence and instrument of truth creates powerful symbolism. The subversion of expected violence into spiritual confrontation offers meaningful thematic depth. The story shows rather than tells Tenzin's internal struggle through his actions and observations. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more emotional weight in the final moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its approach to revenge and justice through music rather than violence. The tooth mark analysis provides a fresh investigative method. However, some phrasing feels overly formal ("a shadow of doubt crossing features once serene with devotion"), and the emotional nuance occasionally relies on stating rather than showing. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally employs predictable spiritual language that borders on clich√©.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates diverse elements into a cohesive narrative with spiritual depth. The flute's tooth marks, shipping label, and gondola setting all serve the central themes rather than feeling forced. The transformation of vengeance into illumination offers meaningful resolution that lingers. While occasionally relying on expected Buddhist tropes, the story generally achieves a balance of tension, atmosphere and thematic resonance that elevates it beyond its constraints.</comment>
