<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miguel is well-established as a steady character with clear reverence for the temple, though his gravedigger role is somewhat underplayed. His motivation to preserve the temple feels authentic, but his character could be more deeply explored beyond his function. Professor Alvarez serves as an effective foil, but remains somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively centers on the threat to the temple and the characters' determination to save it, creating a clear arc despite the word constraint. However, the "sudden confession" about funding cuts feels abruptly introduced rather than organically integrated. The resolution plan has potential but feels somewhat rushed in execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Aztec temple setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details that effectively bridge past and present. The atmosphere of overlapping worlds is palpable through descriptions of wind, dust, and the contrast between ancient stone and electric lights. The broken fence line creates a meaningful boundary between preservation and progress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the temple as metaphor for cultural preservation against modernization. The image of the serpent shadow climbing steps creates powerful symbolism. The emotional stakes feel genuine, though the dialogue occasionally veers toward exposition. The theme of honoring the past while nurturing the future is elegantly conveyed in the final paragraph's gardening metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, phrases like "raucous silence" and "kindrelizing people" feel somewhat forced. The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the characters' emotional states. Some descriptions ("diligently whimsical") seem inserted to fulfill requirements rather than emerging naturally from the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about cultural preservation and the tension between past and present. The prose is generally strong with evocative imagery, though occasionally strains to incorporate all required elements. The ending effectively ties together the themes while leaving readers with a sense of hope and purpose.</comment>
