<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marble's character is well-developed through his telepathic abilities and tragic circumstance. His motivation to seek truth and connection despite his stone imprisonment creates a compelling tension. The tragically joyful attribute manifests naturally in his perspective. However, his personality could be more distinctly revealed through his telepathic interactions, showing rather than telling his emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from Marble's static existence to the transformative revelation. The calligraphy method is seamlessly integrated as both plot device and metaphor. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with the weatherizing threat creating tension and Eliza's discovery providing resolution. The cause-effect relationships are logical, though the alchemist's experiment backstory feels slightly rushed in its revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square creates a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that contrasts beautifully with Marble's stone immobility. Sensory details of "hissing pipes," "churning gears," and "rain and soot" effectively establish the industrial setting. The gloomy cheerfulness of tone perfectly complements both the steampunk aesthetic and Marble's paradoxical existence. The world feels fully realized despite the word constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses Marble's condition as metaphor for isolation and recognition as path to freedom. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the transformation scene. Literary devices like "emotions leaking into his consciousness like watercolors bleeding through paper" enhance the narrative. The theme of being truly seen is poignant, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The story successfully shows rather than tells Marble's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some phrasing feels formulaic ("beautifully terrifying sight"). The metaphors are generally fresh, but occasional phrases like "cracked through Marble's stony heart" verge on clich√©. The narrative maintains consistent tone and style, though some emotional descriptions could be more nuanced. The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The living statue concept, calligraphy method, and hair tie talisman work together naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity serves the story well, creating a fairy-tale quality appropriate to the content. The final line delivers thematic resonance that lingers beyond the narrative itself, though some middle sections could be tightened for greater impact.</comment>
