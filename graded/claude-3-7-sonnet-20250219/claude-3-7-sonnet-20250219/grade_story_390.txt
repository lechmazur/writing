<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wei's duality as a deadly assassin and butterfly collector creates an intriguing character foundation. His emotional complexity—feeling nothing during kills but overwhelming emotion before/after—adds psychological depth. However, his transformation from killer to life-preserver feels somewhat rushed within the constraints, and his internal conflict could be more thoroughly explored through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Wei's butterfly collection to his mission, creating a satisfying parallel between preservation and prophecy manipulation. The narrative arc is complete, moving from assignment to resolution. However, the transition from assassin to deceptive savior feels slightly underdeveloped, with the solution appearing too easily without sufficient obstacles or complications to heighten tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is richly evoked through specific details like "ornate marble floors," "scrolls of imperial decrees," and the "scent of jasmine." The atmosphere of secrecy and court intrigue perfectly complements Wei's character and mission. The juxtaposition of delicate butterflies against the deadly palace politics creates effective symbolic resonance throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The butterfly metaphor works brilliantly as both literal collection and symbolic representation of fate/prophecy. The story effectively explores themes of destiny versus choice, creation versus destruction. While the emotional impact is strong, some dialogue feels slightly expository, and the resolution could benefit from more showing of the soothsayer's reaction rather than telling about Wei's hopeful observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and thematic coherence. However, certain phrases like "figuratively literal" feel somewhat forced, and the butterfly-as-prophecy metaphor, while clever, becomes slightly heavy-handed through repetition. Some descriptions ("darting eyes and trembling hands") rely on familiar character indicators rather than fresh observations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The butterfly collection serves both plot and character development effectively. While the prose occasionally becomes too explanatory rather than evocative, the overall execution creates a memorable character study with philosophical undertones about fate, duty, and personal conscience that lingers after reading.</comment>
