<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza's character as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is well-established and her motivation to connect with her drowned parents is emotionally resonant. Her joyfully melancholic attribute manifests naturally in her actions and dialogue. However, her character could benefit from more complexity or internal conflict to elevate beyond the somewhat straightforward portrayal of grief and acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the beginning and end with a satisfying emotional arc of seeking and finding closure. The "arousing" of spirits through the BB gun creates a logical progression. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed and predictable—the mother's appearance and message arrive too easily, without sufficient buildup of tension or obstacles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is richly atmospheric and meaningfully connected to both the character's past and present. Sensory details like "peeling paint," "salt air," and the "tinny melody" create a vivid, haunting environment that perfectly complements the supernatural elements and themes of memory and loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (amber preserving the past, thawing heart) and creates emotional resonance. The central theme of reconnection with the past while moving forward is well-executed. However, the dialogue between Eliza and her mother's ghost feels somewhat generic, missing an opportunity for more nuanced emotional complexity or surprising revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-like patterns, certain phrases ("joyfully melancholic," "fleeting rebellion against grief") feel slightly formulaic. The emotional progression follows a predictable arc of loss-to-healing without subverting expectations. The metaphors (particularly around thawing) are effective but occasionally border on cliché. The ending resolves too neatly for a story dealing with complex grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The amber and carnival setting particularly enhance the themes of preservation and the past. However, the story's resolution feels somewhat too tidy for its subject matter, and certain elements (like the wreck-diver profession) feel more like obligatory inclusions than essential components of the narrative.</comment>
