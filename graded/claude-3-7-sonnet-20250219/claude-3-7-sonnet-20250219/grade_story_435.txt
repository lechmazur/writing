<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Eliza Thorne has clear motivation to liberate dreams from government control, but her character lacks depth beyond this mission. Her impersonation shows determination, but we get limited insight into her personal struggles or emotional complexity. Her professional background as a dream interpreter informs her actions logically, but her character would benefit from more nuanced reactions to obstacles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with Eliza infiltrating the facility to plant devices that will change collection protocols. The impersonation drives tension effectively, and the ending provides resolution with her capture but mission completion. However, the "baking" timeframe feels awkwardly integrated, and some cause-effect relationships (particularly how her devices will actually change the laws) remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly realized with its towers, chambers, and marble slabs of dream law. The atmosphere of clinical control contrasted with the ethereal nature of dreams creates effective tension. Sensory details like the humming machinery and the "quiet pulse" of the reactor create an immersive environment that enhances the story's themes of control versus freedom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of personal freedom, government control, and the power of imagination. The metaphor of dreams calcifying into crystals parallels the calcification of laws restricting human imagination. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting broader implications. However, the story relies too heavily on exposition rather than showing Eliza's emotional journey through action and sensory experience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dream vapor concept shows originality, but certain phrases feel formulaic ("peculiar faith" appears twice). The writing occasionally defaults to telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Eliza's emotions. While the world-building is creative, some descriptions use unnecessarily complex phrasing that feels artificial. The story avoids major narrative inconsistencies but could benefit from more specific, vivid details about the dream crystals and their effects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about dream control and liberation. The concept of harvested dreams feels fresh, and the protagonist's mission creates genuine stakes. However, certain elements (particularly "during baking" and "occasionally frequent") feel awkwardly incorporated rather than essential to the narrative. The story leaves readers with compelling questions about freedom and control but would benefit from tighter prose and deeper character development.</comment>
