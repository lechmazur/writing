<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Professor Thorne is well-established as an amiable scholar with clear motivation, though his character could be more deeply revealed through action rather than exposition. His dedication to unorthodox research methods and gentle rebellion against academic norms creates a consistent personality. His relationship with the lighthouse and its ghosts feels authentic, but his emotional depth remains somewhat surface-level, with limited opportunities to see his character tested or changed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—waiting for funding decision, receiving good news, planning for the future—but relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatic action. The vibrating phone effectively drives the minimal plot forward, creating tension before the resolution. The story achieves completeness within its constraints, though the stakes feel somewhat muted. The connection between the crossword clue and the thematic resolution is clever but could be more organically integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly rendered with specific details like brass instruments, weather-worn logbooks, and creaking timbers that create a vivid atmosphere. The interplay between shadows, light, and sound effectively establishes the supernatural elements without overstatement. The lighthouse functions both literally and metaphorically as a place where past and present meet, reinforcing the story's central theme. The sensory details of creaking floors and dancing shadows create immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the lighthouse as both setting and metaphor for illumination of forgotten histories. The parallel between guiding ships and guiding lost stories creates thematic resonance. The crossword puzzle's "PRESENT" answer cleverly ties together the narrative threads. However, the story relies more on telling than showing in places, particularly regarding the professor's research methods. The conflict is subtle—academic skepticism versus supernatural truth—but could be more dramatically rendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of communicating with ship timbers is original, the execution occasionally relies on familiar academic-outsider tropes. The writing contains some unnecessarily ornate phrases ("humble rebellion of a scholar") that feel slightly artificial. The emotional beats are somewhat predictable, and the shadows that "retreat slightly, as if acknowledging this victory" verges on cliché. The professor's character, while consistent, lacks the idiosyncratic details that would make him distinctly memorable beyond his unusual research.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole that balances supernatural elements with academic pursuit. The lighthouse setting naturally accommodates the themes of illumination, guidance, and the intersection of past and present. The brevity works well for this contemplative moment, though it limits deeper character development. The story leaves readers with intriguing questions about what the timbers might reveal, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative, but some elements feel more integrated than others.</comment>
