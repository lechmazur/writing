<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's ability to see ghosts is well-integrated with her motivation to find liberation. Her "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests in her movements and complements her introspective nature. However, we could benefit from more specific examples of how her ghost-seeing ability affects her daily life as an elevator technician, creating a missed opportunity for deeper characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elara's haunted state to her liberation, with the dissection of the flower crown serving as a compelling catalyst. The connection between her ghost-seeing and personal trauma creates narrative coherence. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, with her transformation occurring too quickly given the established depth of her trauma.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, evocative setting that metaphorically reinforces the theme of preserving what is inherently impermanent. The contrast between the lab's silence and the ghostly whispers creates effective atmospheric tension. The foggy streets outside provide a fitting backdrop for ghost tours, though more sensory details would strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the flower crown as faded memories, sand castles as preserved impermanence) to explore themes of letting go. The emotional arc is satisfying, with Elara's liberation feeling earned. However, the narrative relies too heavily on telling rather than showing in key moments, particularly when describing her emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally falls into predictable patterns. The writing sometimes becomes overly ornate ("elegantly clumsy," "complex simplicity") without fully earning these paradoxical descriptions. The ghost metaphor for unresolved trauma is effective but not particularly innovative. The emotional resolution follows a somewhat formulaic epiphany-to-liberation arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The parallel between preserving sand castles and holding onto ghosts/memories creates resonance. However, some elements feel slightly forced rather than organic to the narrative, and the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity, creating moments of unnecessary opacity.</comment>
