<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's vigilance and grief-driven motivation are consistent, but his character lacks depth beyond his obsession. His "sardonic glee" feels more stated than demonstrated through authentic reactions. The transition from orchardist to conspiracy theorist happens too abruptly without showing the psychological evolution that would make this change believable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from tragedy to investigation to revelation, but suffers from convenient connections and rushed development. The conspiracy's specifics remain vague, and the climactic demonstration feels contrived. The peacock pattern metaphor is repeatedly mentioned but inadequately explained in terms of how it actually reveals industrial espionage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates an unusual backdrop with potential, but lacks sensory details that would make it vivid. The contrast between Elias's orchard life and the sterile facility could be more effectively leveraged. The atmosphere shifts between melancholy and triumph without fully developing either mood through environmental cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of grief as motivation, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing emotional states. The peacock tail metaphor has potential but remains underdeveloped. The resolution feels rushed and the emotional payoff of Elias's journey lacks the nuance needed to make his transformation resonant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from formulaic phrasing and repetitive mentions of elements (particularly "sardonic glee" and "peacock's tail") that feel mechanically inserted rather than organically integrated. Character reasoning follows an overly logical progression without human messiness or doubt. The conspiracy plot relies on convenient connections rather than earned revelations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story attempts to weave assigned elements into a coherent narrative, many connections feel forced rather than natural. The premise has originality, but execution lacks the subtlety and depth needed for literary distinction. The emotional core—grief transformed into purpose—has potential but remains underdeveloped beneath plot mechanics.</comment>
