<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as an underestimated rebel is established but lacks depth. Her motivation shifts from vague rebellion to specific transformation without sufficient development. The connection to her grandmother through the knife offers a glimpse of backstory, but her personality remains largely told rather than shown. Her relationship with Chen feels underdeveloped despite its narrative importance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks clear causality and concrete action. The transformation of an abandoned amusement park is introduced late and remains abstract. The story relies heavily on metaphorical language rather than actual events, creating a narrative that feels static despite its transformative theme. The beginning and end connect thematically but without a satisfying progression of events.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is effectively atmospheric and serves as a strong metaphor for Maya's internal state. Sensory details like "flickering light," "peeling wallpaper," and "dusty mannequins" create a vivid environment. However, the setting remains somewhat underutilized as a physical space where action occurs, functioning more as symbolic backdrop than interactive environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The story relies excessively on telling rather than showing, with numerous abstract statements about transformation and adaptation without concrete demonstration. While metaphors abound (knife blades as survival tools, haunted house as internal landscape), they become repetitive. The central conflict remains nebulous, and the resolution—transforming the park—lacks specificity about how or why this would constitute meaningful change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose is often purple and repetitive, with an overreliance on abstract concepts rather than specific details. Phrases like "ephemeral gloom," "luminous determination," and "vibrate with possibility" feel generic and emotionally distant. The story follows a predictable template of personal transformation without surprising developments. Character emotions are primarily stated rather than demonstrated through action or dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all assigned elements, it does so at the expense of narrative clarity and momentum. The elements feel like constraints the story must accommodate rather than organic components of a cohesive narrative. The abstract, metaphor-heavy approach creates distance rather than emotional connection, and the brevity highlights conceptual vagueness rather than concentrated impact.</comment>
