<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus has a clear motivation and his ghostly abilities shape his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond his function in the plot. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute appears only once rather than informing his characterization throughout. The ghost researcher shows potential but remains largely a plot device rather than a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution, with Marcus's investigation leading to the ghost's liberation. The connection between the elevator repair and spiritual liberation creates a satisfying metaphorical framework. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly when explaining the ghost's backstory, which weakens the narrative tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a distinctive, evocative setting that perfectly complements the themes of preserving memories and fragile histories. The "peculiar silence that seemed to vibrate with unspoken histories" effectively establishes atmosphere. Sensory details like the humming preservation chambers and the afternoon light on the dried flower crown create a tangible world where the supernatural feels natural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the elevator as both literal object and metaphor for "lifting suppressed narratives." The theme of liberation through acknowledgment rather than erasure provides meaningful depth. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by occasional abstract phrasing ("complex simplicity") that creates distance rather than intimacy with the characters' experiences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing, the writing occasionally relies on unnecessarily ornate phrasing ("delicate sand sculpture being carefully reconstructed") and abstract concepts that feel more performative than authentic. Emotions are often stated rather than shown, and the ghost's backstory follows predictable patterns of "suppressed research" without specific, vivid details that would make it distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a satisfying thematic resolution. The metaphorical connection between elevator repair and spiritual liberation shows creative thinking. However, some elements feel more integrated than others, and the writing occasionally prioritizes poetic phrasing over emotional authenticity, preventing the story from achieving its full potential impact.</comment>
