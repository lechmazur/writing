<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena has a clear motivation and her character is shaped by her unique blend of scientific and spiritual approaches. However, her development remains somewhat static throughout the story, and her reactions to the supernatural phenomena lack the emotional depth that would make her fully three-dimensional. Her connection to the sewing box is established but not fully explored in terms of how it shapes her methodology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elena's cleaning to her discovery and connection with the past, but the resolution feels rushed. The action of "corralling" memories is present but not fully integrated into the narrative mechanics. The cause-and-effect relationship between Elena's actions and the poltergeist's responses lacks sufficient development, creating logical gaps in how her methodology actually works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Roman villa setting is effectively established and works well with the timeframe of cleaning. Strong atmospheric elements create a sense of historical weight and mystery. However, sensory details beyond the visual are limited, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in this ancient space through sound, smell, and texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth in exploring connections across time, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing these connections. The central conflict between past and present, science and spirituality is present but underdeveloped. While there are effective moments of imagery, the emotional impact is diluted by overly formal language and insufficient character interiority to make the reader truly feel the significance of Elena's discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from excessive formality and unnecessarily complex vocabulary that creates distance rather than intimacy. Phrases like "ruthless kindness" and "architectural bones" feel artificially literary. The narrative progression is predictable, following a common template of discovery without surprising turns. Emotional states are often stated rather than demonstrated through action or reaction, giving the writing a mechanical quality that undermines its authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the story successfully incorporates most assigned elements, they often feel like checkboxes rather than organic components of the narrative. The brevity constrains development of the supernatural elements, leaving them feeling more like convenient plot devices than meaningful aspects of the world. The central concept of bridging past and present has potential but lacks the nuanced execution needed for lasting impact.</comment>
