<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias Reese is developed with clear motivation tied to his sister's loss, and his woodsman background meaningfully contrasts with his technological pursuit. However, his emotional journey lacks sufficient nuance and development within the word constraint. The hairbrush serves effectively as both memento and tool, but his character would benefit from more specific personal history to elevate him beyond the archetype of "grieving brother seeking closure."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the electromagnetic mapping with the protagonist's search for closure regarding his sister, creating a coherent metaphorical journey. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc from mystery to revelation within the tight constraints. However, the mechanics of how the hairbrush functions as a detection tool remain underdeveloped, and the final revelation feels somewhat rushed rather than fully earned through narrative progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is exceptionally well-realized, with vivid sensory details that merge the technological and natural worlds. The electromagnetic wilderness serves as both literal setting and metaphorical landscape of memory and loss. The juxtaposition of rusted antennas, overgrown circuitry, and the water tower creates a hauntingly specific atmosphere that perfectly complements the themes of connection across boundaries and forgotten pathways.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses electromagnetic signals as a metaphor for human connection beyond death, creating resonant subtext. The parallel between mapping lost railways and tracing his sister's journey demonstrates sophisticated thematic integration. While the emotional payoff is strong, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Elias's epiphany about honesty. The ending achieves poignancy but could benefit from more specific imagery to ground its metaphysical implications.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the electromagnetic landscape metaphor is original, the story occasionally lapses into overly ornate language ("despairing cheer," "veins beneath translucent skin") that feels more performative than authentic. The narrative relies somewhat heavily on the trope of finding closure through a physical object connected to the deceased. The emotional arc follows a predictable pattern of revelation and acceptance without sufficient complication or surprise to distinguish it from similar stories of grief and closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole, particularly in how it merges the technological with the emotional. The radio wave garden setting provides a fresh framework for exploring grief and connection. However, the brevity constrains full development of the mechanics behind the electromagnetic detection and limits exploration of the sister's character beyond her function as motivation. Despite these limitations, the story achieves a haunting resonance that lingers beyond its conclusion.</comment>
