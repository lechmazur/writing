<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's character is well-established through his chameleonic abilities and artistic method. His motivation to resurrect forgotten experiences through embodied storytelling is clear and consistent. The "rationally impulsive" contradiction effectively shapes his artistic approach. However, we lack deeper personal stakes or internal conflict that would elevate him beyond his function as a historical medium.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds toward the climactic revelation of the murderer's identity. The cold-case mystery framework provides coherent purpose to Li Wei's performance. However, the actual murder mystery remains somewhat abstract, with limited development of the specific Tang Dynasty crime beyond broad outlines of "court intrigue." The story achieves a complete arc but lacks specific dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-oil world and repurposed Imperial Palace create a distinctive atmosphere that enhances the narrative. The fractured skylights casting light across Li Wei's transforming skin creates powerful visual imagery that connects setting, character, and concept. The juxtaposition of ancient history with post-petrochemical future creates a compelling temporal tension that serves the theme of preservation through embodiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of historical memory, embodied knowledge, and performance as preservation. The metaphor of the human body as archive is compelling. The final transformation sequence provides a satisfying climax. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by the abstract presentation of the historical crime and limited personal stakes for Li Wei beyond his professional purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors ("anxious serenity," "emotional honesty") rather than specific, vivid details that would make the performance tangible. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("his muscles tracing the choreography"). The story maintains consistent tone but lacks the idiosyncratic touches and surprising turns of phrase that would distinguish truly original writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinctive premise. The post-oil world where performance preserves memory creates a compelling framework. However, the abstract nature of the historical crime and limited personal stakes for Li Wei prevent the story from achieving its full emotional potential. The writing is polished but occasionally prioritizes concept over concrete detail.</comment>
