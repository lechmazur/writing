<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Gregory de Marco lacks depth beyond his occupation and basic emotional states. His "inwardly social" attribute is mentioned but not meaningfully demonstrated through actions or internal dialogue. His motivation shifts between apprehension, curiosity, and desire without clear progression. The character remains a vehicle for plot events rather than a fully realized individual with consistent traits driving his decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot structure suffers from repetitive descriptions of similar actions without clear progression. The narrative circles around Gregory discovering and deciphering puzzles without showing the specific challenges or solutions. The story lacks a clear inciting incident and meaningful resolution, instead offering vague references to "enigmatic revelations" without concrete stakes or consequences. Cause-and-effect relationships remain nebulous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The psychic research facility creates an appropriately mysterious backdrop, and the juxtaposition with dance lessons adds an interesting layer of normalcy against the paranormal. However, the setting remains underdeveloped, with few specific sensory details to ground the reader. The atmosphere successfully conveys mystery but relies on abstract descriptors ("enigmatic," "cryptic") rather than concrete, evocative imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with an overabundance of adjectives and abstract concepts that create distance rather than immersion. The central conflict remains vague, and the resolution offers no specific revelation or transformation beyond generic statements about "embracing mystery." The prose is consistently overwrought, prioritizing flowery language over meaningful narrative development or emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The writing exhibits numerous hallmarks of AI-generated text: excessive adjectives, repetitive phrasing ("cryptic symbols," "enigmatic truths"), abstract emotional states without specific manifestations, and a reliance on vague, grandiose language rather than concrete details. The story repeatedly mentions the same elements (puzzles, hidden room) without developing them. Characters lack individual voices, and the prose maintains an unnaturally formal, overwrought style throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all required elements, it does so mechanically rather than organically. The narrative lacks focus, attempting to cover too many abstract concepts without developing any of them meaningfully. The prose is consistently purple, prioritizing ornate language over clarity and emotional impact. Despite the supernatural premise, the story fails to create genuine intrigue or stakes, leaving the reader with vague impressions rather than a cohesive narrative experience.</comment>
