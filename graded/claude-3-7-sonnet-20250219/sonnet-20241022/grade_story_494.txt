<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from arrogance to humility is effectively portrayed through his actions and internal reflections. His character arc is clear as he acknowledges his past mistakes and embraces tradition. However, the brevity of the piece limits deeper exploration of his personality beyond this central transformation, and his initial arrogance is more told than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Marcus's regret to redemption through the restoration of magical wards. The cause-effect relationship between his actions and consequences is logical, and the resolution feels earned. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action within the tight word limit, though the initial conflict could be more explicitly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard provides an evocative setting that perfectly complements the themes of tradition and magical writing. The atmosphere of shadows giving way to light creates a powerful visual metaphor for Marcus's journey. The sensory details of the glowing brushstrokes and light spreading "like ink in water" are particularly effective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tapestry as both literal object and metaphor for broken traditions. The theme of humility and respect for ancestral knowledge resonates throughout. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the final image of tears cutting "clean tracks through the dust." The story successfully shows rather than tells Marcus's transformation, though some metaphors (like the moth simile) feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some phrases ("ink in water," "submission to tradition") feel somewhat expected. The emotional arc is genuine, but occasionally relies on familiar fantasy tropes of magical restoration. The prose sometimes edges toward purple, particularly in descriptions of the magical effects, though it generally maintains control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The magical system feels internally consistent despite the brief format. The theme of reconciling tradition with individual power gives the piece depth beyond its plot. While occasionally veering toward overwrought language, the story maintains a consistent tone and leaves the reader with a satisfying sense of restoration.</comment>
