<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent—his obsession with mapping the railway that claimed his grandmother's life creates a compelling character arc. His relationship with family heirlooms (the hairbrush, radio) effectively reveals his emotional connection to his past. However, the "woodsman" aspect feels underdeveloped; we understand his quest but get limited insight into how his professional background shapes his methods beyond providing a cover story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the protagonist's journey from solitary obsession to supported research creating a satisfying arc. The narrative elegantly connects the beginning (grandmother's memory) to the end (finding the railway beneath the garden) with effective cause-and-effect relationships. The parallel timing of discovering the railway while his mother dies creates powerful dramatic tension. The short-circuiting element is organically integrated as both literal threat and metaphorical representation of his emotional state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is exceptionally realized through vivid, specific imagery ("defunct satellite dishes bloomed like metal flowers") that creates a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. The juxtaposition of electromagnetic technology with natural imagery creates a distinctive world where the past and present overlap. The abandoned water tower serves as both practical plot device and powerful symbol. The sensory details—particularly the auditory elements of static, frequencies, and the phantom train horn—immerse the reader in this unique liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of grief, obsession, and resolution. The parallel timing of the protagonist's discovery and his mother's passing creates a poignant moment of narrative symmetry. The electromagnetic signals serve as an effective metaphor for memory and connection across generations. The ending delivers a satisfying emotional payoff that feels earned rather than manipulative. The theme of finding oneself through mapping the past is subtly developed throughout rather than explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its concept of electromagnetic remnants preserving historical memory. The integration of technology and emotion feels fresh rather than formulaic. The writing avoids purple prose while still achieving lyrical moments. Some metaphors ("radio wave garden") are particularly inventive. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic. The only weakness is occasional overreliance on abstract concepts rather than concrete sensory details in a few passages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The narrative achieves emotional resonance while maintaining logical consistency in its speculative elements. The parallel timing structure creates tension and meaning that elevates the piece beyond a simple quest narrative. The story lingers after reading, suggesting depths beyond its explicit content. While a few connections could be strengthened, the overall execution demonstrates sophisticated craft within tight constraints.</comment>
