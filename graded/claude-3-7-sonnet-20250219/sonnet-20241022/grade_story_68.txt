<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as a hacker with a moral code is established effectively through her actions and motivations. Her determination to restore an erased name shows clear moral purpose. However, her sudden adoption of this cause ("three minutes ago") feels underdeveloped - we don't learn why she specifically cares about this particular historical figure, which limits deeper character development. Her technical skills and methodical approach are well-portrayed, but her emotional connection to the mission remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the tea steeping timeframe to create tension and urgency. The narrative moves logically from discovery to decoding to revelation, with a satisfying resolution when Maya broadcasts the name. However, the story's brevity limits explanation of key elements - particularly why this name matters enough to risk security protocols and how Maya became involved. The connection between bottle caps and data fragments is creative but could be more thoroughly integrated into the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient Rome with cyberpunk creates a distinctive, visually rich setting. The juxtaposition of "holographic merchants" with "crumbling marble columns" and "AR toga-clad avatars" with "flesh-and-blood tourists" effectively establishes a world where past and future collide. Sensory details like the clinking bottle caps and the changing color of steeping tea ground the fantastical elements. The marketplace serves as both literal and metaphorical crossroads, enhancing the theme of historical revision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of historical erasure, truth versus official narrative, and digital archaeology. The metaphor of steeping tea paralleling the uncovering of truth is particularly effective. The ending delivers emotional impact through its act of public restoration. However, the story relies heavily on telling rather than showing Maya's emotional stakes, and the conflict lacks specificity - we never learn concrete details about who this person was or why they were erased, which limits the story's resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of ancient Roman and cyberpunk elements, and the bottle cap data collection concept is inventive. However, several phrases feel unnecessarily ornate ("her moral compass pointed toward a different truth") and the writing occasionally slips into telling rather than showing. The narrative relies on somewhat generic cyberpunk tropes (neural implants, quantum algorithms) without adding distinctive twists. The emotional core - why this particular historical figure matters - remains underdeveloped, suggesting algorithmic prioritization of setting over character depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with clear beginning, middle, and end. The fusion of ancient and futuristic creates a distinctive atmosphere, and the theme of historical revision resonates. However, the brevity constrains character development and emotional stakes. While technically accomplished with evocative imagery, the story would benefit from more specific details about the erased figure and Maya's personal connection to the cause. The concept is stronger than its execution, though the story shows considerable creative potential.</comment>
