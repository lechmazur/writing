<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed as a character with clear motivation and consistent actions. His blacksmith background informs his careful handling of delicate objects, creating an effective contrast. His empathy toward the spirits, especially the ghost child, reveals depth. However, his internal conflict could be more pronounced, and his dialogue is limited to a single line that, while thematically relevant, doesn't fully showcase a distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Marcus's nightly ritual to his interaction with the ghost child, culminating in a meaningful connection through shared rhythm. The action of mollifying the spirits through his craft creates a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The cause-and-effect relationship between his rhythmic hammering and the spirits' response is particularly well-executed. The story achieves a sense of completeness without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is vividly realized with "dust-laden halls" and moonlight catching on miniature stained glass. The juxtaposition of the blacksmith's calloused hands against delicate treasures creates compelling tension. The atmosphere of reverent preservation amid spectral presence is consistently maintained. Sensory details like the echoing hammer strikes effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space between past and present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of memory, preservation, and connection across the divide of death. The metaphor of heartbeats synchronizing with spectral pulses powerfully conveys the central message. The ending satisfies by completing both the physical restoration and the emotional connection. The story shows rather than tells emotional states, particularly in how the ghost child's form steadies as she watches Marcus work. The subtext about humanity's endurance through craft adds meaningful depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its concept, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("dust-laden halls," "trapped stars"). The emotional resonance is genuine, particularly in the ghost child's response to Marcus's work. However, certain descriptions like "essence of human creativity" veer toward abstraction rather than specific detail. The story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on somewhat predictable emotional beats in the ghost-human interaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, creating an intimate vignette that suggests a larger world. The emotional impact lingers beyond the final line, particularly in the image of colors pulsing with shared rhythm. While some language occasionally trends toward the ornate, the overall craftsmanship demonstrates thoughtful attention to both the assigned elements and the emotional core of the narrative.</comment>
