<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is effectively portrayed as a "docile bruiser" whose deafness shapes his interactions with the environment in meaningful ways. His gentle handling of dangerous plants and the baton reveals his character. The connection to his mother adds emotional depth, though his internal thoughts could be more developed to strengthen his characterization beyond the established traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from discovery to resolution with the twist effectively reframing the baton's purpose. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with Marcus's journey through the greenhouse culminating in a meaningful revelation. The causal relationships are clear, though the botanist's warnings subplot feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth with carnivorous plants creates a vivid, immersive setting that perfectly complements the story's themes. The contrast between the violent plants and Marcus's calm demeanor enhances tension. Sensory details—visual movement of plants, vibrations of music—effectively establish atmosphere while reinforcing Marcus's deaf perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully subverts expectations with its twist on the baton's true purpose. The theme of misunderstood intentions (both the plants' and the baton's) creates meaningful subtext about perception and communication. The ending delivers emotional resonance by connecting to Marcus's relationship with his mother, though the conflict with the botanist could be more fully integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its interpretation of the "raise the dead" concept. The writing maintains consistent tone and avoids purple prose while delivering vivid imagery. The character's deafness is handled with nuance rather than as a mere plot device. Some transitions between elements feel slightly mechanical, but overall the narrative voice remains authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The subversion of expectations regarding the baton's power creates depth beyond the explicit narrative. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a focused piece with emotional resonance and thematic clarity about misunderstanding and communication.</comment>
