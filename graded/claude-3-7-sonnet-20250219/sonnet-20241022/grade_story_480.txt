<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The social media exorcist has a clear motivation and unique profession that shapes her actions. Her curiosity drives her investigation, and her specialized skills are consistently applied. However, her character lacks emotional depth beyond professional competence, and her "indifferent enthusiasm" feels more told than shown. We get little sense of her personal stakes or internal conflicts beyond professional interest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear investigative arc with logical cause-effect relationships. The infiltration method drives the narrative forward naturally, and the exorcism provides satisfying resolution. However, the story rushes through potentially impactful moments, particularly the actual confrontation and exorcism, which deserved more development given their significance to the plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall creates an effectively eerie atmosphere that complements the digital-supernatural concept. The contrast between mundane daily interactions and hidden digital identities creates compelling tension. Sensory details like the electromagnetic crackle, glowing phones, and reverberating chord effectively establish the uncanny atmosphere where digital and physical worlds collide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of hidden identities and the unseen connections between seemingly unrelated people. The concept of digital possession as metaphor for social media influence is thought-provoking. However, the climactic exorcism feels rushed and lacks the emotional weight it deserves. The story shows rather than tells in most instances, but occasionally defaults to exposition rather than immersive scene-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the digital exorcism concept is inventive, the execution relies on familiar supernatural tropes transplanted to a digital context without sufficient subversion. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate ("the mechanical precision of those possessed by social algorithms"). Character reactions follow predictable patterns, and the protagonist's emotional journey lacks nuance beyond professional satisfaction. The ending falls into the clich√© of the lone hero with secret knowledge walking away from vanquished foes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The digital-supernatural fusion creates a distinctive atmosphere and conceptual framework. However, it prioritizes concept over character depth and rushes through potentially impactful moments. While it leaves readers with interesting questions about hidden identities in the digital age, the execution doesn't fully realize the potential of its premise.</comment>
