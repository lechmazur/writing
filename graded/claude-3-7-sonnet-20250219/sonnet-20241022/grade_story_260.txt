<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric elements are exceptional. The Victorian mansion library during a starless night creates perfect conditions for spiritual communion. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful—whispers accumulating "like autumn leaves," frost patterns from spectral cold spots, and the "brief, brilliant flash" of reconciliation. The whisper collection point serves as an ideal nexus between worlds, with the physical setting enhancing both the supernatural elements and Marcus's methodical work.</comment>
