<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's loyalty as a scout provides a solid foundation, but his character lacks depth beyond his dedication to decoding messages. His inner turmoil is told rather than shown, and while his motivation to find peace is established, we don't get enough specific details about his personal struggles to fully invest in his journey. His voice remains somewhat generic despite the unique circumstances.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the meditation teachings hidden in comedy routines to Marcus's search for inner peace. The narrative has a clear arc from his arrival at the tower to his transformation during the blackout. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the resolution feels more stated than earned. The pacing works well within the constraints, creating a complete if somewhat predictable journey.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a blackout creates a distinctive and atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the themes of darkness, illumination, and transformation. The juxtaposition of the industrial tower against natural moth patterns creates effective tension. Sensory details like the creaking tower, moths casting shadows, and the crackling PA system create a vivid, immersive environment that enhances the meditative mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moths as a metaphor for consciousness and transformation, with strong imagery throughout. The parallel between moth patterns and meditation creates thematic resonance. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diminished by telling rather than showing Marcus's transformation. The ending offers a thoughtful conclusion about duality, but lacks the specificity needed to make it truly profound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on somewhat predictable metaphors and explicitly stated themes rather than allowing them to emerge organically. The meditation jokes feel formulaic, and Marcus's transformation is described in abstract terms rather than through specific emotional or sensory experiences. The prose occasionally becomes overly formal ("sanctified," "consciousness expanding") without the grounding details to earn such elevated language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The moth observation tower and hidden meditation teachings create a unique framework. However, the story prioritizes concept over character depth, and the transformation feels more told than experienced. While it leaves readers with interesting ideas about duality and consciousness, it doesn't fully realize its potential for emotional resonance.</comment>
