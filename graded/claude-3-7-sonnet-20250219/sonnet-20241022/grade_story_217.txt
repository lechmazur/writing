<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character is well-developed through her relationship with grief and her mother's memory. Her transformation from someone running from pain to someone confronting it feels authentic. The pocket knife serves as an effective symbol of her mother's legacy. However, the "underestimated rebel" aspect feels somewhat underdeveloped—we're told others mistake her determination for rebellion, but this isn't fully demonstrated through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves elegantly from Maya's isolation to reconnection with her sister and community. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with the demolition threat creating clear stakes and the resolution feeling earned. The intensification of their night together cooking builds emotional momentum. The transition from personal grief to community action is particularly well-executed, though the property developer's change of heart feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted house setting brilliantly mirrors Maya's relationship with her own ghosts. The contrast between artificial hauntings and real emotional hauntings creates rich thematic resonance. Sensory details of Vietnamese cooking—steam rising, familiar scents—effectively transport readers. The timeframe of dusk-to-dawn creates a liminal atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of transformation. The ephemeral gloom is palpable without being heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story skillfully weaves multiple metaphors (ghosts, cooking, tools) that reinforce the central theme of adaptation. The emotional impact is substantial, particularly in how grief transforms into community action. The ending delivers a profound insight about living with loss rather than running from it. The pocket knife serves as an elegant extended metaphor for the tools needed to process grief. The story shows rather than tells Maya's emotional journey, allowing readers to feel her transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific, meaningful details and consistent characterization. The metaphors (particularly comparing the phone buzzing to "a trapped moth") feel fresh and purposeful. However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward the overly poetic, particularly in the final paragraphs where the language becomes slightly more abstract and generalized. The emotional arc feels genuine rather than formulaic, though the property developer's change of heart could use more nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative. The Vietnamese cuisine, haunted house, and pocket knife all serve the central theme of adaptation and grief. The brevity feels like a strength rather than a limitation, with each paragraph advancing both plot and character development. The story leaves readers with a lingering meditation on how we carry our losses, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
