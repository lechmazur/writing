<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's empathic abilities are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, particularly in how she processes "emotional imprints" and radiates "waves of understanding." Her introversion is subtly shown through her comfort with "quiet revolution" rather than explicitly stated. However, her character lacks deeper complexity or internal conflict that would elevate her beyond a somewhat idealized protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to assembly to revelation, with the marionette reconstruction driving the narrative forward. The cause-effect relationship between the starfish, journal, and puppet pieces creates coherence. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the resolution feels slightly too neat and predictable for a story with cosmic implications.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The asteroid sanctuary is vividly realized with "twisted corridors" and "recycled air," creating a compelling juxtaposition between the confined space and cosmic wisdom. The setting perfectly complements both the outcast theme and the space pirate context. Sensory details like the "stale hideout air" and the puppet's illumination effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the marionette as both literal object and metaphor for connection, with strong imagery of the puppet "trailing ribbons of cosmic understanding." The theme of forgotten wisdom belonging to outcasts resonates throughout. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diminished by telling rather than showing the reactions of the gathered misfits, and the conflict resolution comes too easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, certain phrases like "refugees of reason and logic" and "revolution she had sparked" feel formulaic. The metaphors around wisdom and stars border on clich√©. The narrative maintains consistent tone but lacks the distinctive stylistic fingerprint of truly original work. The emotional resonance, while present, relies more on stated feelings than nuanced character reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of belonging and hidden knowledge. The cosmic setting and mystical objects serve the narrative rather than feeling forced. However, the story's potential depth is limited by its somewhat predictable arc and resolution that lacks sufficient complication or cost to the protagonist.</comment>
