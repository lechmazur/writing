<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as a bright-eyed apprentice is established well through her methodical searching and intellectual curiosity. Her motivation to decode star maps drives her actions consistently. However, we get limited insight into her emotional depth beyond her academic pursuit, and her "brazen calm" feels somewhat told rather than shown through her reactions to extraordinary events.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from discovery to revelation with the phone booth key serving as an effective plot device. The overcharging of ancient systems creates a compelling climax. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with Maya's discovery leading to the activation of the lighthouse beacon. The pacing effectively builds tension toward the revelation of the lighthouse's true purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement creates an immediately evocative atmosphere that perfectly complements the mysterious tone. The post-water wars setting provides meaningful context for Maya's mission. Sensory details like "dusty shelves," "cobwebs," and shadows that "writhe" create a vivid environment. The contrast between ancient technology and futuristic purpose creates effective tension in the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively builds intrigue through the gradual revelation of the lighthouse's true purpose. The imagery of holographic star charts illuminating the basement creates a powerful visual moment. The theme of ancient knowledge holding solutions to humanity's self-created problems emerges clearly. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract, and the "calling home" metaphor, while intriguing, could be developed with more nuance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the premise is original, combining post-apocalyptic elements with ancient alien contact, some descriptions rely on familiar sci-fi tropes ("shadows seemed to writhe," "profound sense of brazen calm"). The writing occasionally defaults to telling rather than showing emotional states. The lighthouse-as-beacon-to-space concept, while interesting, follows predictable patterns of hidden alien technology narratives without significant subversion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The post-apocalyptic setting with ancient alien technology creates an intriguing framework. The writing maintains clarity while building mystery. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed, with the final revelation delivered rather than discovered through Maya's agency, limiting the emotional impact of the conclusion.</comment>
