<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is effectively portrayed as a dreamy poet drawn to forgotten places, with his formally rebellious nature subtly woven into his character. His motivation to preserve the stories of the unremembered is clear and consistent. However, his internal conflict about boarding the phantom train could have been more deeply explored, and his emotional journey feels slightly rushed in the final moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is elegantly crafted with the riddles creating escalating tension toward the climactic moment when time unravels. The causal relationships between the sundial, the letter, and the appearance of the ghostly travelers are logically connected. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though the transition from puzzle-solving to the appearance of the spectral train could have been more gradually developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned railway station overgrown with ivy creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that perfectly complements the theme of forgotten histories. The sensory details—the creeping ivy, the brass sundial, the dying light, the otherworldly resonance—create a richly immersive setting where the boundary between past and present feels genuinely permeable. The physical decay of the station brilliantly mirrors the theme of fading memories.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully explores themes of memory, preservation, and the power of art to resurrect forgotten lives. The central metaphor of the poet as chronicler of lost souls is powerfully rendered. The ending delivers emotional impact through its suggestion that Marcus's poems were somehow memories of people he'd never met. The line "To witness is to preserve, to remember is to resurrect" effectively distills the story's thematic core, though some metaphors occasionally border on the expected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, some phrasing occasionally veers toward the ornate ("green-draped slumber," "twilight rails between memory and forgetting"). The emotional resonance is genuine, particularly in Marcus's realization about his connection to the lost travelers. The narrative avoids most common tropes of ghost stories, offering a fresh perspective on spectral encounters, though the final boarding of the phantom train edges toward familiar territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brass sundial, cryptic seal, and railway station work together to create a unified aesthetic and thematic framework. The quietly intense tone is maintained throughout, creating a dreamlike quality that enhances rather than diminishes the emotional stakes. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of memory, art, and time that extend beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
