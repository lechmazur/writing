<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is well-developed through her scientific precision and emotional complexity. Her conflicted feelings toward Elena reveal depth—professional betrayal intertwined with lingering affection. The apothecary role shapes her actions naturally through her work with compounds and biological engineering. However, her character could benefit from more distinctive dialogue or internal monologue to fully establish her voice beyond her scientific pursuits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the scientific pursuit of tracking butterflies with the emotional journey of reconnecting with Elena. The infection concept drives the narrative forward purposefully, creating both conflict and resolution. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the butterflies serving as both literal and metaphorical connective tissue. The cause-effect relationship between Mira's actions and the butterflies' response creates a satisfying narrative arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is richly realized through specific sensory details—hissing steam, brass fixtures, and the contrast between mechanical elements and organic butterflies. The underwater world becomes a perfect metaphor for isolation and connection. The "broken treaties" timeframe provides meaningful context without overwhelming the narrative. The atmosphere masterfully balances scientific precision with emotional yearning, creating a unique and immersive world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its central metaphor of butterflies as carriers of both scientific truth and emotional connection. The narrative shows rather than tells Mira's complex feelings, particularly in observations like "rust bloom across polished brass." The conflict between professional rivalry and personal longing creates compelling tension. The resolution through scientific collaboration suggests reconciliation without oversimplifying the relationship's complexity. The theme of adaptation—both scientific and emotional—emerges organically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of steampunk aesthetics with scientific precision and emotional depth. The metaphors are generally fresh, particularly the butterflies as carriers of both scientific and emotional "infection." However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward the ornate ("unjustly fair"), and certain emotional beats follow somewhat predictable patterns. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout but could benefit from more surprising turns in how the characters' relationship unfolds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The steampunk submarine setting and the butterfly migration create a distinctive backdrop for the emotional narrative. The scientific framework provides a unique lens for exploring reconciliation and adaptation. While the story occasionally relies on somewhat expected emotional beats, it leaves readers with lingering questions about the relationship's future and the world above, suggesting depth beyond its explicit narrative.</comment>
