<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sir Edmund's character is well-developed through his internal conflict about mercy versus duty. His transformation from proud knight to reflective prisoner shows meaningful evolution. His motivation—grappling with the consequences of sparing the witch-queen—drives the narrative coherently. However, his character could benefit from more distinctive voice or personal quirks to elevate him beyond the archetypal fallen knight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Edmund's past choice to spare the witch-queen with his present imprisonment and eventual resolution. The pattern-making with collected items creates a compelling narrative device that builds toward the climactic moment with the door knocker. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The revelation that his true prison was psychological rather than physical provides satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is exceptionally well-integrated with the themes of isolation, reflection, and moral ambiguity. Sensory details—salt-crusted mirror, waves crashing against the reef, metallic clang of the knocker—create vivid atmosphere. The mirror serves as both literal object and metaphorical device for self-examination. The setting's isolation perfectly complements Edmund's internal struggle with his impossible choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs symbolism (mirror, collected objects as constellation) to explore themes of regret, mercy, and moral ambiguity. The central conflict between duty and compassion resonates emotionally. The narrative effectively "shows" Edmund's transformation through his interaction with objects rather than explicit statements. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining philosophical complexity about choices being "both wrong and right, both punishment and redemption."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its treatment of the knight/witch-queen dynamic and the lighthouse prison concept, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("exquisite torture," "haunting question," "joyful resignation"). The constellation metaphor, while effective, is somewhat predictably deployed. The story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on abstract emotional descriptions rather than concrete, specific details that would ground the character's experience more authentically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with philosophical depth. The lighthouse prison, collected objects, and mirror reflection work together to create a meditation on choice and consequence that transcends the word limit. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining thematic complexity. While occasionally veering toward purple prose, the writing generally serves the story's emotional and philosophical aims effectively.</comment>
