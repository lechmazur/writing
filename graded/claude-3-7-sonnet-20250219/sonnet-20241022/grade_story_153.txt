<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed through his centuries-long academic pursuit and his relationship with immortality as both his study and his burden. His motivation to preserve human experiences rather than achieve personal immortality reveals depth, though his emotional journey could be more nuanced. The headlamp serves as both practical tool and metaphorical light in darkness, effectively characterizing his role as knowledge-keeper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's academic pursuit with the preservation of humanity's twilight experiences, creating a satisfying arc from his initial quest for immortality to his realization about its true nature. The digitization action drives the narrative purposefully. However, the story lacks a clear central conflict or tension that would elevate it beyond its philosophical musings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subterranean setting after cosmic darkness creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that reinforces themes of preservation amid extinction. The phosphorescent tunnels, crystalline matrices, and the weight of rock above create tangible sensory details that enhance the mood of beautiful desolation. The juxtaposition of mundane observations against cosmic endings is particularly powerful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of light (headlamp, starlight, twilight) against darkness to explore preservation of knowledge amid extinction. The philosophical reflections on immortality being found in preserved experiences rather than endless life creates meaningful depth. However, the narrative relies too heavily on exposition rather than dramatization, telling us Marcus's revelations instead of showing his journey to them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution relies on somewhat predictable philosophical tropes about immortality and meaning. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("mundane glories," "ordinary infinities") in ways that feel artificial rather than authentic. The character's emotional journey lacks the messiness and contradiction of human experience, presenting instead a too-neat philosophical resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with genuine thematic resonance about preservation, witness, and the nature of immortality. Its strengths lie in atmospheric world-building and philosophical depth, though it would benefit from more dramatization of its ideas through concrete scenes rather than exposition. The ending effectively completes the character's arc with a meaningful realization.</comment>
