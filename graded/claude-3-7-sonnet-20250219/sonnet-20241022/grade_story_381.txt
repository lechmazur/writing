<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's character is well-developed through her connection to her father's baseball cap and her fusion of necromancy with technology. Her motivation to map the caves is clear and consistent. The character possesses a distinct personality—reverent of tradition yet innovative—though deeper emotional complexity could be explored beyond her professional drive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the mapping action to drive the narrative forward, with a clear beginning (setting up the exploration), middle (working with spirits), and satisfying conclusion (discovering the cathedral-like chamber). The story achieves a sense of completeness despite its brevity. The pacing is well-managed, though the conflict feels somewhat understated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline caves of Europa are vividly rendered with phosphorescent depths and bioluminescent crystals. The juxtaposition of ancient necromancy with futuristic technology creates a compelling atmosphere. The sensory details—ghostly figures illuminating passages, holographic displays on crystal walls, pale blue light trails—effectively immerse the reader in this alien yet familiar environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of connection across time and the marriage of past and future. The imagery of spirits illuminating unknown passages works as both literal plot and metaphor for knowledge transmission. The ending satisfyingly ties together the personal (father's legacy) with the professional (exploration). The narrative could benefit from a more pronounced central conflict to heighten tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the premise is original—necromancy in space exploration—some descriptions rely on expected sci-fi terminology. The "worn cap" and "small smile" are somewhat generic character indicators. The story avoids purple prose but occasionally uses predictable phrasing. The fusion of mysticism and technology feels fresh, though the emotional resonance remains somewhat surface-level rather than deeply nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole. The necromancy, space exploration, and nostalgic connections all serve the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity works well for this vignette of discovery. The story leaves readers with thoughtful connections between past and future, tradition and innovation, though it could benefit from more distinctive stylistic choices to elevate it to truly exceptional status.</comment>
