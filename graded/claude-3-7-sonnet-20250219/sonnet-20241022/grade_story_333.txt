<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as a sincere rebel is well-established through her dedication to preservation and defiance against developers. Her motivation is clear and consistent. However, her character lacks some depth—we understand her professional passion but get limited insight into her personal complexities beyond her grandmother's influence. Her dialogue with the ghost feels somewhat stilted rather than organic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with Maya discovering and connecting with the ghost through their shared passion. The theorizing effectively drives the narrative forward. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and convenient, with the ghost too quickly transforming from threatening presence to ally without sufficient tension or development of that relationship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted passage between storms creates an evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details—damp stone walls, temperature drops, and thunder. The setting perfectly complements the preservation theme, with the manor itself becoming a character. The physical manifestations of the ghost (cold spots, water stains) effectively blend the supernatural with the architectural elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of preservation versus progress and finding unexpected allies. The sticky note's transformation serves as a clever metaphor for the evolving relationship. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diminished by telling rather than showing Maya's feelings, and the conflict resolves too neatly without sufficient struggle or cost to Maya.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of an architectural preservationist bonding with a ghost is intriguing, the execution relies on some predictable ghost story tropes. The dialogue occasionally feels stilted ("I know you're trying to protect this place"), and emotional states are sometimes told rather than shown. The ghost's transformation from threat to ally follows a somewhat formulaic pattern without surprising developments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about preservation across time. The concept of two rebels from different eras uniting for a common cause creates meaningful resonance. However, the story would benefit from more nuanced character development and a less predictable resolution to elevate it from good to exceptional.</comment>
