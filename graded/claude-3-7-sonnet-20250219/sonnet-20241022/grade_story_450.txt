<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's character shows promise through her dancer's physicality contrasted with her scientific mind, but her motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped. Her linguistic ineptitude creates an interesting tension with her intellectual capabilities, though this conflict isn't fully explored. Her relationship with her grandmother's legacy provides emotional depth, but her internal struggle between skepticism and acceptance feels rushed rather than organically developed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Maya's bath-time reflection to her eventual realization about movement as language, creating a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The progression from denial to acceptance follows logically, though the final transformation feels somewhat abrupt. The integration of the family photo tradition as coordinates is clever, but the leap to the bathroom tiles transforming could benefit from more groundwork.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the intimate bathroom setting and cosmic implications creates compelling tension. The steam, bubbles, and fogged mirror effectively enhance the liminal atmosphere where reality shifts. The thought experiment chamber's brief appearance creates intrigue, though its physical properties remain vague. The sensory details of the bath effectively ground the cosmic elements in tangible experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully explores themes of embodied knowledge versus intellectual understanding through effective metaphors of dance as language. The parallel between quantum entanglement and choreography creates meaningful subtext. The ending achieves poignancy through Maya's simultaneous acceptance and rejection of reality. The story effectively "shows" Maya's transformation through her physical movements rather than merely telling us about her change in perspective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of dance as universal language is handled with originality, certain phrases like "the weight of her years of denial lifted" feel formulaic. The story avoids most common sci-fi tropes about alien communication, but the transformation sequence relies on familiar "chosen one" narrative patterns. The emotional progression feels somewhat accelerated rather than earned through nuanced character development. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate, particularly in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole, particularly in connecting dance, space exploration, and quantum physics. The brevity works in its favor by creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the content. While the story leaves readers with intriguing questions about Maya's fate, the philosophical implications of embodied knowledge versus linguistic understanding could be more thoroughly explored. The story demonstrates creative thinking but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic language.</comment>
