<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's character is well-developed through his methodical nature (never tardy) and his motivation is crystal clear. His vigilance as an orchardist transfers effectively to his investigative work. However, his emotional journey feels somewhat underdeveloped - his grief and anger are told rather than shown, and his dialogue occasionally feels too on-the-nose rather than authentically sardonic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably tight for a short piece, with excellent cause-and-effect relationships. The demonstration action drives the narrative forward naturally, and the conspiracy unraveling follows logical progression. The peacock pattern creates an elegant connection between the daughter's warning and Marcus's investigation. The resolution feels earned rather than contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a distinctive atmosphere that perfectly complements both the conspiracy concept and the peacock pattern method. The contrast between Marcus's orchard background and the sterile testing facility creates effective tension. The setting enables both the conspiracy and its unraveling in a way that feels organic rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock imagery as both literal pattern and metaphor for justice/revelation. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the final paragraphs where Marcus's patience is compared to fruit ripening. The central theme of patterns hiding in plain sight is well-executed. However, some dialogue feels slightly expository, and the emotional catharsis could be more deeply rendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, there are moments of overly neat exposition and some predictable narrative beats. The peacock metaphor, while effective, is somewhat overused. The story follows a relatively conventional revenge/justice arc without significant subversion. Some descriptions feel slightly generic rather than specific to Marcus's perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional resonance. The peacock pattern creates an elegant throughline that ties together the daughter's warning, Marcus's investigation, and the final justice. While not groundbreaking in structure, the execution is skillful, with the short form feeling appropriate rather than limiting. The ending provides satisfying closure while maintaining emotional impact.</comment>
