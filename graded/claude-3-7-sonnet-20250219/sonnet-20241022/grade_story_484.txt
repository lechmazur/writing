<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus has a distinct personality as a somewhat pretentious craft brewer seeking inspiration in unusual places. His grogginess is well-integrated through "bleary eyes, still heavy from sampling too many test batches." His motivation to create something unique drives his actions, though his character could benefit from more complexity beyond the hipster-brewer archetype. His internal dialogue establishes a clear voice, but his emotional depth remains somewhat limited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Marcus seeking inspiration to creating his unique brew with supernatural assistance. The discoloration on the staircase effectively drives his journey deeper into the mansion. The story achieves a satisfying resolution with the creation of the "Haunted Mansion Midnight Stout." The pacing works well within the constraints, though the transition from exploring to brewing happens somewhat abruptly without showing the actual brewing process in detail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion setting is vividly rendered with excellent sensory details like "air hung thick with dust and disappointment" and darkness "like a thick stout you could chew on." The juxtaposition of brewing equipment against supernatural elements creates an effective atmosphere. The external protest timeframe creates tension and isolation. The world-building efficiently establishes both the physical space and its supernatural qualities through specific, evocative details.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses brewing as a metaphor for creative struggle and authenticity. The narrative creates tension through Marcus's reckless exploration and the supernatural elements. Literary devices like "darkness swirled around him like foam on a perfectly poured pint" enhance the storytelling. The ending satisfyingly resolves the conflict between generic and unique creation. The story successfully "shows" the atmosphere through sensory details rather than telling, though character emotions could be more subtly conveyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI pitfalls, some metaphors feel somewhat predictable ("cosmic joke about self-reflection"). The brewing-as-art metaphor is clever but not entirely original. The character's internal monologue occasionally relies on telling rather than showing his emotions. The story does maintain consistent tone and style throughout, and the concept of brewing with supernatural elements offers a fresh twist on the haunted house trope. The sensory details are specific and vivid rather than generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The brewing concept provides a unique framework for exploring creativity and authenticity. The supernatural elements enhance rather than distract from the central theme. The ending delivers a satisfying payoff that ties together the character's motivation and the setting's supernatural qualities. While not groundbreaking, the story demonstrates creative thinking in its concept and execution.</comment>
