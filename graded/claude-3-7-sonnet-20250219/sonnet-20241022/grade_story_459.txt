<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed through his unique ability to see ghosts and his methodical approach to understanding them. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute is mentioned but not fully demonstrated through action. His motivation to help ghosts find peace emerges organically, though his personal stakes could be deeper. His relationship with Sarah adds dimension, but his voice lacks distinctive qualities in the limited dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Marcus's descent to his meaningful gesture with the flower crown. The "dissect" action drives his ghost investigations forward naturally. The story achieves a sense of resolution within the word limit, though the connection between elevator repair and ghost liberation feels somewhat tenuous. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action, but the central conflict remains somewhat understated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, evocative setting that meaningfully connects to the theme of impermanence and letting go. The "dissonance of silence" is masterfully woven into the midday atmosphere. Sensory details like the "soft hum of humidity control systems" effectively immerse the reader. The juxtaposition of scientific preservation and spiritual release creates thematic resonance that enhances the emotional impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sand castle as a metaphor for futile attempts to preserve what's lost. The ending gesture with the flower crown delivers emotional impact through showing rather than telling. The theme of finding peace through acceptance rather than preservation emerges organically. While dialogue is limited, it serves the narrative purpose well. The story would benefit from slightly more tension or stakes to elevate its impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of ghosts in a sand castle lab shows originality, but certain phrases like "glistening ethereal eyes" and "in that moment...understood exactly what he meant" feel formulaic. The story avoids major clich√©s but occasionally relies on expected ghost story elements. The final line veers toward telling rather than showing the emotional impact. The writing maintains consistent tone but lacks distinctive stylistic flourishes that would elevate it beyond competent prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of impermanence and acceptance. The sand castle preservation lab cleverly mirrors the futility of holding onto what's lost. While the prose is generally strong, it occasionally defaults to expected ghost story conventions. The ending gesture provides emotional resonance, though the final line spells out the theme too explicitly rather than trusting the reader to make connections.</comment>
