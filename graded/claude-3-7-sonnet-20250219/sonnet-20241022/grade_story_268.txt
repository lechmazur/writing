<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's character has a clear motivation and backstory, with her vigilantism shaped by her martial arts training. Her deliberate clumsiness as a cover is intriguing, though her emotional depth remains somewhat underdeveloped. The wooden bead effectively connects to her past and mission, but her internal conflicts could be more nuanced beyond the straightforward pursuit of justice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively integrates the funhouse mirror as both tool and metaphor, creating a coherent narrative arc from observation to imminent action. The story builds tension well toward a climactic confrontation. However, the resolution remains implied rather than shown, and some causal relationships (particularly how the mirror creates technological blind spots) could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned hospital waiting room creates a powerful atmosphere of desolation that mirrors the moral emptiness of the targets. Sensory details like the "hum of distant servers" and "screaming silence" effectively establish mood. The juxtaposition of the sterile medical environment with Maya's martial practice creates compelling visual contrast. The funhouse mirror serves as both practical tool and symbolic representation of distorted reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the funhouse mirror as both literal tool and metaphor for distorted perspectives and justice. The narrative builds tension well and creates a satisfying arc toward implied resolution. The theme of justice requiring precision rather than force is well-integrated. However, the story relies more on telling than showing in places, particularly regarding Maya's emotional state, and some metaphors (like the pulsing bead) feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI hallmarks, certain elements feel formulaic. The repeated references to "her master" and "ancient art" lack specificity, and phrases like "justice would demand its price" read as generic. The funhouse mirror concept is original, but its technological properties aren't convincingly explained. The writing occasionally slips into unnecessarily formal constructions and relies on stated rather than demonstrated emotions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with clear thematic purpose. The funhouse mirror serves as both plot device and metaphor, while the hospital setting effectively reinforces themes of healing justice. However, some elements feel more integrated than others, and the writing occasionally prioritizes poetic phrasing over clarity. The story creates intrigue but would benefit from more specific details about the martial art and the nature of the crimes being exposed.</comment>
