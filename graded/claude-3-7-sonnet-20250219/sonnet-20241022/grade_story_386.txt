<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-developed through her actions and motivations. Her identity as a time refugee shapes her entire existence, and her trustworthy-strange attribute is effectively conveyed through her lighthouse keeper position. However, we lack deeper emotional complexity beyond her mission, and her voice remains somewhat distant despite the intimate nature of her struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses Marina's act of catapulting messages across time as its central action, creating a coherent narrative about preservation of memory. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, though the resolution feels somewhat abstract rather than concrete. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action, but lacks a definitive climactic moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse creates a powerful atmosphere that perfectly complements the temporal displacement theme. The setting functions both literally and metaphorically, with the lighthouse beam serving as both practical tool and symbolic connection to lost time. Sensory details like the "perpetual fog" and the embroidered tablecloth's shifting patterns create a vivid, immersive world that enhances the story's emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through its layered metaphors of light, memory, and preservation. The lighthouse beam as a communication method across time creates a powerful central image. The theme of defiance against erasure resonates emotionally, though the ending, while poetic, could deliver a more specific emotional punch. The story effectively shows rather than tells Marina's determination through her actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of time refugees and memory preservation. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and nuanced handling of complex concepts. However, some metaphors like "walls between then and now" and "timelines shifted like sand" verge on familiar territory, and the emotional landscape occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than demonstrated ones. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive stylistic signature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The concept of preserving forgotten history through light signals creates a compelling central metaphor. While the brevity works well for establishing the premise, it limits deeper character development and emotional payoff. The lingering image of lighthouses communicating across quantum foam provides intellectual and emotional resonance beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
