<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character development is strong, with her analytical nature clearly driving her actions and creating a compelling arc from reluctance to acceptance. Her motivation evolves naturally as she discovers the true purpose of the orchard. However, her initial reluctance could be more deeply established, and her emotional transformation feels slightly accelerated within the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the dragon tooth as both literal and metaphorical key, creating a satisfying arc from inheritance to purpose-finding. The narrative flows logically from discovery to revelation to acceptance, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The resolution feels earned rather than forced, though the middle section could benefit from slightly more tension before the revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of futuristic city against ancient farmland creates a vivid atmosphere, enhanced by specific details like "neon spires," "force-field dome," and "data-threads." The quantum nature of the orchard is consistently integrated with the setting's technological elements. The hidden sunrise timeframe perfectly complements the revelation theme, symbolizing Maya's dawning understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of inheritance, preservation, and finding purpose in unexpected places. The central metaphor of memory-fruits requiring tears creates emotional resonance and thematic depth. The ending satisfyingly transforms the "curse" into opportunity. However, some metaphors ("cobwebs of data-threads") feel slightly overwrought, and the emotional impact could be heightened with more specific sensory details of Maya's first fruit-tasting experience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases ("beautiful melancholy," "gleeful ache") feel slightly generic in their emotional description. The concept is original, but some descriptions rely on adjective pairs that create a somewhat formulaic rhythm. The narrative maintains consistent tone and style, though occasionally veers toward purple prose in its metaphorical language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The quantum orchard concept provides a strong foundation that naturally accommodates the various elements. The emotional and thematic resonance of preserving extinct species through memory creates depth beyond the explicit narrative, though some descriptions could be more precise and less reliant on abstract emotional states.</comment>
