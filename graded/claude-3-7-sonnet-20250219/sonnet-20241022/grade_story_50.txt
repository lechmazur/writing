<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sister Marie's character development is strong, showing clear evolution from rigid missionary to spiritual seeker. Her crisis of faith and transformation are well-portrayed through her interactions with the piano and butterfly. However, her backstory remains somewhat vague, and we could benefit from more specific details about her previous life to better understand her journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively traces Sister Marie's spiritual transformation through her interaction with the piano's resonances. The narrative arc is complete within the word constraint, moving from crisis to revelation. However, the middle section could be tightened to create more tension before the resolution, and some cause-effect relationships (particularly how she discovered the piano's properties) feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass desert setting is exceptionally rendered with vivid sensory details that enhance the story's themes of transformation and transparency. The crystalline environment perfectly mirrors Sister Marie's spiritual journey, while the monarch butterfly provides an elegant timeframe that reinforces the theme of metamorphosis. The atmosphere of isolated beauty and mystical discovery is consistently maintained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (butterfly as spiritual transformation, glass as transparency/fragility of faith) and creates emotional resonance through Sister Marie's journey. The theme of finding personal truth beyond dogma is well-developed. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution that feels earned. However, the conflict could be more sharply defined early on to increase narrative tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some metaphors ("like a lost prayer") feel somewhat expected. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate, particularly in descriptions of the piano's effects. The narrative voice is generally consistent, but a few phrases ("capriciously consistent") feel more like assigned elements being inserted than organic writing. The concept is original, but execution occasionally relies on familiar spiritual transformation tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The glass desert setting and butterfly migration create a distinctive atmosphere that elevates the piece. While some elements feel more naturally incorporated than others, the overall effect is a thoughtful exploration of spiritual transformation that lingers after reading. With some tightening of prose and deeper character development, this could approach publication quality.</comment>
