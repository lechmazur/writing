<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character is well-developed through her artistic sensibility and connection to her garden. Her motivation to remain in space is clear and consistent with her established traits. The "fiercely gentle" attribute manifests beautifully in her careful tending of plants. However, we could benefit from more insight into her pre-station life to better understand her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Maya's artistic documentation to her decision to stay permanently, creating a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The "resuscitate" action drives her character development as she preserves memories while embracing new possibilities. The story achieves remarkable coherence, with each paragraph building logically toward her final decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden setting is rendered with exceptional sensory detail and imagination. The contrast between Earth's "heavy embrace" and the weightless garden creates a powerful atmosphere. The descriptions of zero-gravity horticulture are scientifically plausible yet poetically rendered, with vivid details like "flowers bloomed in impossible spirals" and "auroras paint the atmosphere below."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of adaptation and finding home in unfamiliar places. The central conflict between Earth's pull and Maya's new passion resolves beautifully. Rich metaphors and imagery elevate the narrative, particularly in comparing her visa to "an overdue library book" and her art as "a bridge between worlds." The theme of evolution through separation is powerfully conveyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fresh approach to space habitation, focusing on art and botany rather than typical sci-fi elements. The language is lyrical without becoming purple prose, with specific and vivid details about zero-gravity gardening. The emotional journey feels authentic rather than stated. Some phrases like "fiercely gentle hands" and "impossible spirals" are particularly inventive, avoiding common space narrative tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused meditation on adaptation and belonging. The ending leaves readers with lingering questions about Maya's future and the evolution of her art, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. The integration of scientific concepts with poetic imagery demonstrates creative thinking.</comment>
