<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sir Marcus shows clear motivation and character development as he transitions from rule-abiding agent to protector of folk healing traditions. His internal conflict between duty and newfound purpose is well-established. However, his "voice" remains somewhat distant, and the transformation feels slightly rushed within the word constraint. The knight-turned-operative backstory, while intriguing, isn't fully explored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery (mitten) to investigation to moral choice. The progression from rigid adherence to protocol toward protection of the healers feels organic. The story achieves a satisfying sense of resolution within its constraints. However, the exact nature of the "unauthorized healing centers" and why they require official shutdown remains somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The midnight setting at a deserted intersection creates effective tension, with the brutalist architecture contrasting beautifully with the delicate mitten and folk healing elements. The sensory details—midnight chill, flickering candlelight, embroidered flowers—create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the thematic tension between institutional power and traditional knowledge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of knowledge preservation, institutional control versus folk wisdom, and finding purpose beyond rigid rules. The contrast between cold bureaucracy and warm human connection creates emotional resonance. The ending delivers a satisfying philosophical conclusion about protecting cultural heritage. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding Marcus's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some phrasing feels overly formal ("unwavering loyalty to protocol"). The story relies somewhat on the trope of the rule-follower who discovers a higher purpose. The emotional progression, while logical, occasionally lacks the messiness of genuine human conflict. Some descriptions ("warmed by purpose") edge toward cliché rather than fresh imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The contrast between institutional control and folk wisdom creates meaningful tension. However, the brevity constrains full character development and world-building. While the story achieves emotional resonance, some transitions feel compressed, and certain elements (like Sir Marcus's knighthood) feel underutilized.</comment>
