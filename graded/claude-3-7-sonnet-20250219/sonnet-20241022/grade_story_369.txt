<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's character is well-developed through his puzzle-making obsession and conflicted relationship with isolation. His fanatical pursuit of answers creates a compelling psychological portrait, though his emotional journey could be more subtly revealed rather than explicitly stated. The "optimistically bitter" attribute manifests naturally in his approach to exile and the mysterious packages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the mysterious packages as a driving force, creating tension between Marcus's past and present. The narrative builds logically toward the revelation of the final puzzle box, with the unopened letter serving as an effective framing device. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is masterfully integrated, functioning both literally and metaphorically. The spiral staircase gallery and the lantern room meditation chamber create a vivid, atmospheric space that reflects Marcus's psychological state. Sensory details like the "thick fog" and "churning waters" enhance the isolation theme, while the vertical arrangement of the lighthouse mirrors his spiritual journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the puzzle-making metaphor to explore deeper themes of acceptance and transformation. The string web creates a powerful visual metaphor for Marcus's attempts to connect disparate elements of his life. The mother's final message delivers emotional impact and thematic resonance, though the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing Marcus's emotional state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, phrases like "lethargic excitement" and "optimistically bitter" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient exploration. The lighthouse-as-metaphor is effective but borders on being too neat a parallel to the character's journey. The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, though some emotional descriptions could benefit from more nuanced showing rather than telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The puzzle-making profession aligns perfectly with the character's approach to his emotional challenges. The lighthouse setting enhances rather than constrains the story, and the final revelation provides satisfying closure while maintaining some mystery. A few instances of telling rather than showing prevent it from achieving the highest literary standard.</comment>
