<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's hardheaded determination drives the narrative effectively, with his grief-stricken motivation clearly established. His character arc from desperate seeker to someone who learns to let go shows meaningful development. However, his voice lacks distinctive qualities, and the transformation feels somewhat rushed rather than earned through deeper characterization. The story tells us about his determination rather than fully demonstrating it through specific actions or choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Marcus's desperate quest to his eventual realization and emotional release. The prophecy effectively drives the narrative forward, creating tension and purpose. The resolution provides satisfying closure within the word constraint. However, the middle section lacks sufficient development of obstacles or complications, making his transformation feel somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won. The cause-effect relationship between the melting sculptures and his emotional release could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned art gallery transformed by ice creates a vivid, symbolically rich setting that perfectly complements the emotional journey. The interplay between the natural ice formations and the man-made gallery creates effective tension. Sensory details—moonlight filtering through skylights, ice crackling, prismatic reflections—immerse the reader in this liminal space. The winter setting reinforces themes of death, preservation, and eventual thaw/renewal. The atmosphere powerfully supports both the supernatural elements and emotional core.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ice sculptures as metaphors for Marcus's emotional state, with their melting paralleling his own release. The central theme of letting go rather than seeking control resonates emotionally. The sister's voice provides a poignant moment of revelation. However, the story occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through action. The conflict between Marcus's desire for supernatural power versus natural acceptance is compelling but could be developed with more nuance and specific detail about what exactly he hoped to accomplish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the ice sculpture imagery is fresh, the story relies on somewhat predictable emotional beats and metaphors about grief and letting go. Phrases like "the veil between worlds" and "aurora borealis" energy feel like familiar supernatural tropes. The emotional transformation follows a conventional arc without surprising developments. The writing occasionally becomes overly ornate ("demure stillness," "audacious nature") in ways that feel more performative than authentic to the character's perspective. The resolution leans on explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing it to emerge organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The ice-filled art gallery provides a distinctive setting that enhances the supernatural and emotional elements. The theme of finding healing through acceptance rather than power creates meaningful depth. However, the story occasionally sacrifices specificity for poetic language, and the character's transformation could benefit from more concrete details about his journey prior to this moment. The ending effectively ties together the natural and supernatural elements but feels slightly rushed in its resolution.</comment>
