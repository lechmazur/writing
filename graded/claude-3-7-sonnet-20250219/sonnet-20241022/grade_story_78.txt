<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's transformation from accountant to humanity's last astronomer is compelling and well-motivated. Her connection to her grandmother provides emotional depth and explains her scientific curiosity. However, we could benefit from more specific moments showing her internal struggle rather than being told about her "reluctant awe" and transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves smoothly from discovery to revelation, with Maya's investigation of the changing cosmos driving the plot forward. The connection between her grandmother's research and Maya's observations creates satisfying coherence. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, though the exact nature of the "world ending" remains somewhat undefined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop garden under a purple sky creates a vivid, haunting atmosphere. The juxtaposition of earthly survival (growing vegetables) with cosmic mystery is particularly effective. Sensory details like "fingers stained with soil" and the "eerie purple sky" ground the fantastical elements in tangible reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of transformation, continuity after death, and humanity's place in cosmic change. The spyglass serves as both literal tool and metaphor for perspective. While emotionally resonant, some metaphors (like "twisted patterns above") could be more specific, and the exact nature of the cosmic revelation remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing ("filled her with reluctant awe"). Some phrases like "cosmic metamorphosis" and "delicate threads of gravitational force" feel slightly generic. The narrative maintains consistent tone but could benefit from more specific, unexpected details about how exactly the universe is "evolving."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores profound themes of cosmic change, loss, and continuity. The astronomical garden mirroring celestial patterns is particularly inventive. While the prose occasionally becomes abstract when describing the cosmic changes, the emotional core of Maya's connection to her grandmother grounds the narrative effectively.</comment>
