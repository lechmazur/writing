<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlo's character is well-established through his occupation and supernatural ability. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests in specific actions, and his motivation to understand ghosts drives the plot. However, his emotional journey lacks sufficient depth—we're told he seeks liberation from regrets, but these regrets remain vague, preventing full emotional investment in his character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from problem to resolution, with the flower crown discovery serving as an effective turning point. The ghost tours method integrates well with the protagonist's goal. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and convenient—the emotional payoff of their mutual liberation would benefit from more development rather than being stated in the final lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, evocative setting that symbolically connects to the theme of impermanence. The atmosphere of silence and hushed tension is consistently maintained throughout, effectively supporting both the supernatural elements and Arlo's emotional journey. The sensory details around silence create a palpable atmosphere that enhances the ghostly encounters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses silence as both literal phenomenon and metaphor for emotional barriers. The parallel between Arlo and the ghost woman creates thematic resonance about acceptance versus avoidance. However, the story relies too heavily on telling the reader about emotional states rather than allowing them to emerge organically through action and dialogue, particularly in the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally falls into predictable patterns. The ghost's appearance and the protagonist's immediate understanding of her needs feels convenient rather than earned. The prose sometimes becomes overly ornate ("dissecting every faint echo," "resonating deep within him like a chord that refused to resolve"), creating distance rather than intimacy with the character's experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth about acceptance and letting go. The sand castle setting cleverly mirrors the story's themes of impermanence. However, the resolution relies too heavily on explicit statements of theme rather than allowing the reader to experience the emotional catharsis alongside the character, preventing it from achieving its full potential impact.</comment>
