<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman's character shows promise through the juxtaposition of external arrogance and internal insecurity, but lacks depth. His "doubtfully confident" nature creates an interesting tension, yet his transformation feels rushed and insufficiently earned. The character's motivation becomes clearer as the story progresses, but his reactions to the tapestry and song lack the emotional complexity needed to make him fully dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc—from seeking validation to self-authorization—but suffers from compression. The connection between the tapestry fragment and the swordsman's journey is established but underdeveloped. The resolution comes too easily, with the master's simple nod and song triggering an epiphany that feels unearned. The cause-effect relationships exist but lack sufficient development within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard provides an effective setting for this tale of transformation, creating a contemplative atmosphere that contrasts nicely with the swordsman's internal conflict. The sensory details of sword rasping and calligraphic flourishes effectively establish the environment. However, the world beyond this immediate setting remains undeveloped, limiting the story's contextual richness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth through its exploration of authority, lineage, and self-acceptance, but doesn't fully realize its potential. The metaphor of the tapestry as both literal object and symbol of fragmented identity shows craft, but the emotional impact is diminished by telling rather than showing the character's transformation. The ending aims for profundity but relies on somewhat predictable imagery of light and darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: overly formal phrasing, abrupt emotional transitions, and reliance on stated rather than demonstrated feelings. Phrases like "harsh tenderness" and "doubtfully confident" feel contradictory without sufficient context to make them meaningful paradoxes. The narrative progression follows a predictable template of seeking wisdom from a master figure, with the character's transformation occurring too suddenly to feel authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all required elements, it struggles to transcend their mechanical inclusion. The prose occasionally achieves moments of lyrical beauty, particularly in descriptions of the calligraphy and the traditional song, but is undermined by formulaic character development and rushed emotional revelations. The brevity constrains rather than concentrates the narrative, leaving potentially rich themes underdeveloped.</comment>
