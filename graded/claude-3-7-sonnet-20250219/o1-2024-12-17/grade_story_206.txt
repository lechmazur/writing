<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The candy sculptor's vendetta provides clear motivation, but his character lacks depth beyond his anger. His transition from pure vengeance to hope feels abrupt rather than earned. While his creative skill with sugar as both art and weapon is distinctive, his emotional journey needs more nuance to feel fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has intriguing elements—photographs leading to a mysterious continent—but suffers from rushed pacing and underdeveloped connections. The counterattack against the rebels feels incidental rather than pivotal. While the quest structure works, the transition from market vendetta to continent-seeking adventure creates narrative whiplash without sufficient bridging.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is effectively atmospheric, with its labyrinthine stalls, flickering lanterns, and hushed whispers creating a tangible sense of place. The contrast between delicate sugar art and the market's squalor adds texture. However, the world beyond the market (Somnenia) remains too vaguely sketched to fully resonate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the candy sculptures as both metaphor and literal weapon, creating a distinctive central image. The theme of transforming art into vengeance has potential, but the emotional impact is diluted by telling rather than showing the protagonist's feelings. The ending opens possibilities but lacks the resonance of a truly satisfying conclusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The writing relies heavily on abstract emotional states ("burning resentment," "bitter wrath") rather than concrete demonstrations of feeling. Several phrases feel formulaic ("heart pounding with newfound zeal"). The narrative progression follows predictable patterns, and the sudden introduction of Somnenia feels like a convenient plot device rather than an organic development from established elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story integrates most assigned elements coherently, it struggles with balancing its ambitious scope against its length constraints. The candy sculptor concept is original, but the narrative tries to encompass too much—revenge plot, mysterious photographs, hidden continent, family legacy—without giving sufficient space to develop any single thread with the depth it deserves.</comment>
