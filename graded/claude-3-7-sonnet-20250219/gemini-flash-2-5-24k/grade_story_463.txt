<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's dry wit is established well through dialogue and narration. His motivation to learn traditional methods is clear, though could be more deeply integrated with his personality. His actions align with his established goals, particularly in how he approaches the ghost with the rope and shanty. The character has a distinct voice in limited dialogue, but lacks deeper complexity that would elevate him beyond his functional role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The confiscation action drives the plot effectively, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, moving from Kael's entry to his escape with the ledger. The pacing is well-managed, though the confrontation with the ghost feels slightly rushed. The connection between the crossed-off names and Kael's mission creates coherent narrative tension that resolves satisfyingly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-realized through sensory details like "air thick with salt," "dust motes dancing in moonlight," and "salt-warped desk." The atmosphere perfectly complements the concept of eroding promises, with the physical decay of the lighthouse mirroring the spiritual decay of broken pacts. The setting enhances both the action and the ghostly encounter, creating a richly immersive environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses imagery and symbolism, particularly in how the physical decay of objects mirrors spiritual decay. The central conflict is clear and resolved purposefully. The theme of preserving forgotten traditions emerges organically. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted, and while the story shows rather than tells, some moments could benefit from deeper character interiority to elevate the stakes beyond the procedural.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, with consistent tone and few clich√©s. The lighthouse setting and spectral bureaucracy feel fresh. However, some descriptions ("voice like grinding shells") verge on purple prose, and the ghost's dialogue is somewhat generic. The emotional resonance remains surface-level, with limited nuance in how Kael feels about his work beyond professional competence. The narrative follows somewhat predictable ghost story patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative. The elements serve the story rather than feeling forced. The brevity works well for this ghost encounter, creating a snapshot of a larger world. The writing style generally supports clarity while maintaining atmosphere. The ending leaves readers with questions about Kael's broader mission and the nature of these spectral pacts, suggesting depth beyond this single encounter.</comment>
