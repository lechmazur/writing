<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-developed through his unique perspective on ghosts and his methodical approach to understanding them. His motivation to find peace with his unwanted ability is clear and consistent. The "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests naturally in his physical movements, reflecting his internal struggle. However, we could benefit from more insight into how he developed this ghost-seeing ability and why it troubles him so deeply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elias's initial observation of ghosts to his realization about acceptance rather than banishment. The staking out of ghost tours as a method drives the narrative forward logically. The story achieves a satisfying resolution within the word limit, though the middle section could be tightened to strengthen the connection between his observation of the flower crown ghost and his epiphany about emotional archaeology.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a compelling juxtaposition—a place dedicated to preserving the past while Elias learns to let go of spectral remnants. The atmosphere of "spectral static" and "quiet hum of existence" effectively establishes the liminal space between living and dead. Sensory details like the brittle petals of the flower crown and the "ache" Elias feels create immersive moments, though more consistent sensory grounding throughout would strengthen the world-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of acceptance and letting go through the metaphor of "emotional archaeology." The subtext about learning to live with what we cannot change resonates beyond the ghost narrative. The ending feels purposeful, with Elias finding peace through understanding rather than fixing. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, and the conflict could be heightened to create more tension before the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story presents an original take on ghost-seeing by framing it as a problem of "spectral noise" rather than fear. However, some phrases like "complex simplicity" and "emotional residue" feel somewhat generic. The narrative occasionally slips into telling rather than showing, particularly when explaining Elias's realizations. While the concept is fresh, the execution sometimes relies on abstract descriptions rather than specific, vivid details that would make the spectral encounters more distinctive and authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about acceptance and understanding. The sand castle lab and ghost-seeing elevator technician create an intriguing juxtaposition that serves the theme well. The brevity works for this contemplative piece, though some sections feel slightly underdeveloped. The story leaves readers with the lingering idea that liberation comes not from eliminating our burdens but from changing our relationship to them—a thoughtful takeaway that elevates the piece beyond its fantastical premise.</comment>
