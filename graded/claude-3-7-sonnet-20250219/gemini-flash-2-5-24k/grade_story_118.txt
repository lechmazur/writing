<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist is a genuinely innovative character whose collective nature directly informs their methods and perspective. Their motivation to "anchor the ephemeral sound of hindsight in reality" is clearly established and consistently drives their actions. The multi-voiced commentary and "sigh that seemed to come from multiple chests at once" effectively convey their unique nature. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into the internal dynamics of this collective consciousness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively centers on the draining action, with a clear beginning (preparation), middle (the extraction process), and implied resolution (by dawn). The cause-effect relationship between the wax dripping and the extraction of regrets is well-established. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though the stakes could be higher—we understand the process but not fully what might happen if it fails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with sensory details like "smelling faintly of ozone and regret" and the "low thrum of 'if onlys'" creating a vivid, unique setting. The secret agent facility at night perfectly complements the clandestine, psychological nature of the therapy. The scuffed plug as a grounding element for psychic energy creates a compelling juxtaposition between the mundane and the extraordinary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the physical manifestation of regrets as a powerful metaphor, creating layers of meaning about how we process failure. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments like "Agents shifted, some visibly relaxing as the weight of their pasts was literally pulled from them." The ending creates a satisfying circular structure while hinting at the cyclical nature of the therapist's work. The central tension between past regrets and future missions is elegantly handled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its concept and execution. The metaphor of solidifying regrets avoids cliché, and the writing maintains a consistent, distinctive voice. Phrases like "wrestling the ghosts of tomorrow's failures into solid, peculiar shapes" show creative flair. The emotional nuance is well-handled, particularly in the therapist's wry commentary. Some sentences could be tightened for greater impact, but overall, the writing feels authentic and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, intriguing narrative that feels complete despite its brevity. The concept of physically extracting and anchoring regrets is both original and thematically rich. The writing balances clarity with evocative language, creating a distinctive atmosphere that lingers. The story leaves the reader with questions about the nature of regret and hindsight that extend beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
