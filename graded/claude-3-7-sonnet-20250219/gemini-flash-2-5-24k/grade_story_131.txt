<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's character is well-developed through her relationship with the stones and her response to the anomaly. Her aloofness is shown rather than told, and her orphan status informs her need for constants. Her motivation to transform fear into courage is consistent and drives her actions. However, her voice lacks some distinctiveness, and the transition from fear to adaptation feels slightly rushed rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses garage cleaning as a framework for discovery and transformation. The cryptic message creates a turning point that drives the narrative forward. While there is a clear arc from fear to adaptation, the resolution feels somewhat hasty and convenient. The cause-effect relationship between the message and Elara's change in perspective could be more deeply developed within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a unique, physically unstable world that brilliantly mirrors Elara's emotional state. Sensory details like the hum vibrating through concrete and dust motes hanging suspended effectively immerse the reader. The setting and the stones work together symbolically, creating a cohesive atmosphere where the external environment perfectly complements the character's internal journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the stones as both literal objects and metaphors for stability. The gravitational anomaly serves as an excellent physical manifestation of emotional uncertainty. While the theme of adaptation is clear and compelling, the emotional impact is somewhat diminished by telling rather than showing in places. The ending offers a satisfying sense of determination but could deliver a more profound insight or moment of revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story shows originality in its gravitational anomaly concept and how it connects to emotional adaptation. However, some phrases feel formulaic ("cold dread washed over her"), and the character's reasoning follows a somewhat predictable pattern. The narrative occasionally relies on stating emotions rather than fully embodying them through action. While the premise is fresh, the execution sometimes falls into expected patterns of discovery and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The gravitational anomaly and stones work particularly well together as both literal and metaphorical elements. While the narrative achieves a complete arc within its constraints, some transitions feel rushed, and deeper emotional resonance is sometimes sacrificed for plot progression. The story leaves readers with an intriguing concept but could delve deeper into its implications.</comment>
