<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is merely stated rather than demonstrated through dialogue or internal monologue. While the character has clear motivation to recover the rope and honor promises, the emotional depth feels somewhat superficial. The character's connection to the keeper provides motivation, but the personality lacks distinct voice beyond poetic narration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from crossing off the final name to recovering the rope and determining to pass on knowledge. However, the stakes remain vague and the confiscation lacks tension or obstacles. The connection between the dance, the rope, and the "rescue rituals" feels intriguing but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly evoked through sensory details like the "storm-lit beacon," "salt-stained parchment," and the rope's "faint scent of sea-foam." The atmosphere of loss, duty, and ghostly presence permeates the text, creating a powerful melancholy that complements the theme of eroding promises.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story employs evocative imagery and metaphor throughout, particularly in connecting the lighthouse's rotating beam to the waltz and the rope to broken vows. The theme of preserving tradition against erosion by time is compelling. However, the overly ornate language occasionally obscures meaning rather than enhances it, and the conflict lacks sufficient development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While atmospheric, the prose tends toward purple with excessive metaphors ("eyes flickering like a storm-lit beacon," "rope thin as a whisper"). Some descriptions feel generic despite their poetic quality. The narrative relies heavily on telling emotional states rather than showing them through action. The central metaphor of dance as connection to tradition is original, but the execution feels somewhat formulaic in its poetic density.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole with atmospheric strength. The lighthouse setting and the rope as symbol work particularly well together. However, the emotional core remains somewhat distant due to ornate language that occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over clarity and character development. The story shows promise but needs more restraint in its imagery to achieve true resonance.</comment>
