<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lian's character shows potential through his chameleon-like adaptability and artistic motivation, but remains underdeveloped. His "rationally impulsive" nature is mentioned but not deeply explored through specific internal conflicts or decisions. The story tells us his purpose rather than revealing it through meaningful character moments or growth. His connection to the doll's dress feels incidental rather than character-defining.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—Lian discovers a mystery, finds a connection, and resolves it through performance—but the case itself lacks stakes and complexity. The connection between the poet's lullaby and the palace's grief is asserted rather than developed. The pacing feels rushed, particularly in how quickly Lian solves the mystery and stages his performance, with insufficient buildup to make the resolution satisfying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Chinese palace with its marble corridors, broken beams, and Hall of Mirrors creates a distinctive, atmospheric setting. The post-oil world and sunlight filtering through debris effectively establish both time and mood. The sensory details of amber light, shattered glass, and echoing silence work well. However, the world beyond the palace remains vague, and the consequences of oil depletion are suggested rather than shown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of memory, truth behind illusion, and art as healing, but doesn't fully realize these ideas. The imagery of light and shadow is effective, but the emotional impact is diluted by telling rather than showing Lian's discoveries and the audience's response. The central metaphor of performing lost stories to heal collective grief has potential but lacks the narrative development to resonate deeply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The writing relies on ornate language that sometimes obscures rather than illuminates the narrative. Phrases like "anxious serenity" and "rationally impulsive" feel contradictory without sufficient context to make them meaningful paradoxes. The story relies heavily on stating emotions and concepts rather than embodying them through specific, vivid details or character actions. The awakening stone statues appear abruptly, suggesting a magical element that feels disconnected from the established world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story incorporates most assigned elements relatively smoothly, it prioritizes poetic language over narrative clarity and emotional depth. The premise of a performer solving mysteries through art is intriguing but underdeveloped. The story gestures toward themes of memory, loss, and healing without fully exploring their implications. There are moments of genuine atmosphere and imaginative potential, but the overall execution lacks the precision and emotional resonance needed for truly compelling short fiction.</comment>
