<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The eternal student character is well-developed through consistent motivation and distinct voice. Their academic detachment combined with centuries of dedication creates a believable tension. The "gifted burden" of immortality shapes their actions logically. However, emotional depth beyond scholarly devotion remains somewhat unexplored, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digitization process provides a clear narrative arc with logical progression. The story builds coherently from the character's initial situation to their transformation of knowledge into power. While the plot structure is sound, some middle transitions feel slightly rushed, particularly in explaining how the digitization process actually works to manipulate reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building creates a vivid underground realm with distinctive sensory elements. The mole people, darkness, and amber glow of the headlamp form a cohesive atmosphere. The "after the last star burns out" timeframe perfectly complements the subterranean setting, enhancing the story's otherworldly quality without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively employs light/darkness symbolism and creates meaningful subtext about knowledge and isolation. The final observation that "mastery over reality is less a conquest than a continued conversation with darkness" provides satisfying thematic closure. While the prose is evocative, some metaphors ("binary hymns of darkness") feel slightly overworked rather than organic to the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, but suffers from occasionally ornate language that edges into purple prose. Phrases like "mundanely glorious" appear multiple times, feeling somewhat algorithmic. The narrative maintains a consistent tone, but some emotional nuance is sacrificed for linguistic flourish, particularly in the middle sections where the digitization process is described.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The eternal student and mole people create a unique framework for exploring themes of knowledge and power. While occasionally leaning into unnecessarily complex phrasing, the story leaves readers with lingering questions about immortality, isolation, and the nature of mastery that demonstrate significant depth.</comment>
