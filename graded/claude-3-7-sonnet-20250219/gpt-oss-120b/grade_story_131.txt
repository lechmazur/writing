<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as an aloof orphan is effectively woven throughout the narrative. Her detachment is consistently shown through "eyes distant yet observant" and her interaction with objects rather than people. Her transformation from fear to courage is subtly portrayed through her actions with the stones and garage cleaning, though her backstory remains largely unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly balances the gravitational anomaly with Mara's internal journey. The lottery ticket message catalyzes her transformation, and the loosening action carries both literal and metaphorical weight. The narrative arc is complete within the word constraint, moving from initial uncertainty to resolution as Mara masters both the physical space and her fears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a genuinely unique atmosphere that mirrors Mara's emotional state. The garage setting functions brilliantly as both physical space and metaphorical testing ground. Sensory details like the "metallic lullaby" and stones that "pulse with faint inner light" create an immersive, slightly surreal environment that enhances the central themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its metaphorical layeringâ€”the gravitational anomaly perfectly symbolizes emotional weight and adaptation. The narrative shows rather than tells Mara's transformation through her interaction with objects. The central conflict between fear and courage resolves satisfyingly as Mara learns to work with rather than against the anomaly, creating a powerful metaphor for emotional resilience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the prose demonstrates freshness in its metaphors and avoids most AI hallmarks, it occasionally verges on purple prose with phrases like "indifferent comfort" and "immutable things." The gravitational anomaly concept shows originality, but some emotional states are described rather than demonstrated. The consistent tone and coherent narrative flow suggest authentic human authorship despite these minor weaknesses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The gravitational anomaly serves as both literal setting and metaphorical framework for Mara's emotional journey. Despite the constraints, the narrative achieves resonance through its exploration of adaptation and courage, leaving the reader with a satisfying sense of transformation and triumph.</comment>
