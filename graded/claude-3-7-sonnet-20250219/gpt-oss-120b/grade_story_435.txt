<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is established as a professional dream interpreter with a unique method, but her internal motivations remain somewhat opaque. While her impersonation of Elias creates intrigue, we lack deeper insight into her psychology or emotional landscape. Her actions show determination, but we don't fully understand why she specifically cares about the workers' dreams or how her personal stakes connect to the larger mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with logical progression from problem (workers' disturbing dreams) to solution (Mara's interpretation and transformation of laws). The story effectively weaves together the vapor facility, baker's disappearance, and stone tablets into a coherent narrative with satisfying resolution. However, some logical connections feel slightly rushed or underdeveloped given the word constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility creates a richly atmospheric setting where steam, heat, and metal brilliantly complement the story's themes. Sensory details like "ovens exhaled clouds of vapor like breathing giants" and "sunrise painted the vapor tanks gold" create vivid imagery. The juxtaposition of ephemeral vapor against calcified stone effectively reinforces the central tension between rigidity and imagination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the vapor/stone dichotomy as a central metaphor for the tension between imagination and rigid law. The narrative creates a dreamlike quality that mirrors its subject matter. The resolution delivers emotional satisfaction as dreams literally reshape reality. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing the emotional stakes, and some metaphorical connections could be more subtly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story presents an original concept blending dreams and vapor into a mechanism for social change, certain phrases like "quiet pulse" become repetitive. The paradoxical "occasionally frequent" draws attention to itself as an awkward construction. Some descriptions lean toward purple prose, particularly in moments describing the vapor's movements. The narrative shows creativity but occasionally relies on overly formal constructions that feel slightly artificial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinct dreamlike atmosphere appropriate to its subject. The vapor/stone dichotomy creates a compelling central tension, and the resolution satisfies the narrative arc. However, character development remains somewhat surface-level, and certain phrases feel unnecessarily ornate. The story creates an intriguing world but doesn't fully explore its deeper implications within the word limit.</comment>
