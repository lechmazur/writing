<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer is effectively established with a consistent ghostly presence and perspective. Their motivation to protect ancient traditions is clear, though their connection to being "aggressively kind" feels somewhat underdeveloped. The character's relationship with the whistle is meaningful, but we lack deeper insight into who they are beyond their role as observer and protector.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from observation to action to resolution, with the flinging of the whistle serving as a pivotal moment. However, the exact nature of the "rescue" remains somewhat abstract, and the causal relationships between the whale's call, the dancer, and the ancient traditions could be more explicitly connected. The synchronicity between events creates a mystical atmosphere but occasionally sacrifices narrative clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like "cracked watch room," "rusted rail," and "glass panes." The atmosphere of "brazen calm" pervades the narrative effectively. The timeframe connecting to the dancer's foot touching the stage creates a compelling synchronicity with the whale's call, binding disparate elements into a cohesive world where sea and performance art mysteriously intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively employs imagery and symbolism, particularly in connecting the lighthouse beam, the whale's call, and the dancer's movements as threads binding past and present. The metaphor of sound as a bridge "built from breath and memory" is particularly striking. While the story creates a haunting, ethereal mood, it sometimes prioritizes poetic language over narrative clarity, leaving some thematic connections implied rather than fully developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the prose is often lyrical, it occasionally veers into excessive ornamentation ("the brazen calm of centuries," "phosphorescent algae"). The central metaphor connecting sea, stage, and ancient tradition shows originality, but some descriptions feel deliberately obscure rather than authentically complex. The narrative maintains a consistent dreamlike tone, though the handling of emotion sometimes relies on abstract statements rather than concrete demonstration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves together disparate assigned elements into a cohesive, atmospheric piece. The mystical connection between lighthouse, whale, and dancer creates an intriguing framework, though the abstract nature of the "rescue" limits some narrative impact. The prose is often beautiful but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of tradition and memory that suggest depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
