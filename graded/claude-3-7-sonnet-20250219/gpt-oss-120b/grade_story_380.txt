<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's character is well-developed through her contradictions—mathematically challenged yet precise in dream theft. Her motivation to coax thunder through stolen dreams creates a compelling psychological portrait. However, her emotional journey could be more nuanced; the transition from obsession to calm reverence feels somewhat abrupt rather than earned through deeper character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Mara's dream theft to her desire for thunder, creating a coherent narrative arc. The spectral skyball matches effectively drive the story forward with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The resolution when thunder finally breaks provides satisfying closure, though the exact mechanics of how stolen dreams summon storms could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgotten treehouse library creates an evocative, liminal setting that perfectly complements the story's themes of memory and fragmentation. The contrast between the dusty interior and the empty sky creates palpable tension. Sensory details—creaking wood, fluttering pages, glittering dust—immerse readers in this hauntingly atmospheric world suspended between existence and absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and imagery, particularly in connecting thunder to emotional catharsis. The central themes of fragmentation and wholeness resonate throughout. The narrative shows rather than tells Mara's transformation through the physical manifestation of thunder. However, the story occasionally relies on abstract description rather than concrete sensory detail to convey its deeper meanings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the premise is original and the imagery often striking, some metaphors ("eyes flickering like faulty lanterns," "thin as moth wings") feel somewhat familiar. The prose occasionally becomes ornate ("fragmenting selves like broken mirrors") in ways that draw attention to the writing rather than serving the narrative. The story avoids major AI-typical patterns but could benefit from more surprising turns of phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores memory, identity, and connection. The language generally supports the dreamlike quality, though occasionally veers toward the purple. The ending leaves readers with the lingering image of rebuilding from fragments, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. Despite minor stylistic issues, the story succeeds as literary fiction with emotional resonance.</comment>
