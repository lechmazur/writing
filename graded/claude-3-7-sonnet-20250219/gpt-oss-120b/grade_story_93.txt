<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a labyrinth architect protecting sacred geometry is clear, but her emotional depth remains somewhat underdeveloped. Her desperation drives her actions coherently, particularly in her resourceful use of the radio station. However, without dialogue or deeper introspection, her character lacks the nuanced dimensionality that would elevate her beyond her function in the plot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from crisis to resolution with logical cause-and-effect relationships. The action of evading the algorithm's purge drives the narrative forward purposefully, and the method of using the pirate radio is inventively integrated. The story achieves a satisfying sense of completion despite its brevity, though the technical aspects of the algorithm collapse could benefit from more concrete explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive creates a richly atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the themes of sacred geometry and labyrinthine thinking. The sensory details—dim corridors, groaning elevators, fluttering cards—create a vivid, almost mystical environment. The integration of the building itself as a "giant, resonant mandala" effectively transforms the setting into an active participant in the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable depth through its layered metaphors and symbolic resonance. The transformation of crisis into salvation through patterns, signals, and geometry creates a compelling subtext about information preservation and human connection. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction as Mara's desperate hope blooms into certainty. The prose shows sophistication in its imagery, particularly in the description of the signal as "a patchwork of jazz, static, and whispered coordinates."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept is inventive, the execution occasionally relies on overly ornate language ("sacred geometry," "resonant mandala") that feels somewhat artificial. The story avoids major narrative inconsistencies but occasionally defaults to telling rather than showing emotional states. Some metaphors, particularly those involving the cards "fluttering like moths," verge on the predictable. The technical aspects of how the signal preservation works remain conveniently abstract rather than convincingly detailed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The blend of technological and mystical elements creates an intriguing genre-bending quality. Despite occasional moments of overwrought language, the piece achieves a haunting resonance that lingers beyond its conclusion. The transformation of a technical crisis into a moment of transcendent connection demonstrates creative ambition that largely succeeds.</comment>
