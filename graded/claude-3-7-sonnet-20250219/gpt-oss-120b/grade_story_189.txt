<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bright-eyed apprentice demonstrates consistent motivation throughout, with her actions aligned with her goal to decode star maps. However, while her determination comes through clearly, her personality lacks deeper dimensions beyond her mission-focused demeanor. The "brazen calm" is shown rather than merely stated, but her character would benefit from more nuanced internal conflicts or personal stakes to elevate her beyond a capable protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc—from discovery to revelation to resolution—within the tight constraints. The overcharging action drives the narrative forward logically, with clear cause-effect relationships. The story achieves coherence through its lighthouse metaphor and water-scarcity framework. However, the pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle section, particularly in the transition from finding the chamber to decoding the maps, which could benefit from more tension or obstacles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-integrated with both the post-water-war timeframe and the star map concept. Sensory details are vivid and specific—phosphorescent algae, salt-laden air, luminous constellation lines—creating a richly atmospheric world that enhances the mystical yet scientific tone. The setting doesn't merely house the action but actively participates in the narrative through the lighthouse's transformation from war sentinel to beacon of hope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (light cutting through darkness, communication restored) and creates emotional resonance through hope amid scarcity. The lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor works well without feeling heavy-handed. However, the conflict lacks sufficient tension—the apprentice encounters no significant obstacles or moments of doubt. The theme of reconnection (both literal and cosmic) emerges naturally, but the story would benefit from more subtext and complexity in its resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the prose avoids most AI hallmarks like generic descriptors or sudden narrative jumps, it occasionally veers into overly ornate language ("brazen calm," "luminous salt"). The story demonstrates creativity in combining elements like the phone booth key and star maps, but some metaphors feel slightly forced. The emotional landscape remains somewhat surface-level, with the character's reactions predictably aligned with her goals rather than showing more nuanced human complexity or doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story succeeds in weaving multiple assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear throughline. The post-apocalyptic water scarcity setting provides a meaningful framework that elevates the quest beyond mere puzzle-solving. While the prose occasionally trends toward the ornate, it generally maintains clarity. The story's lingering image of the lighthouse transformed from war sentinel to beacon of hope provides thematic resonance, though the protagonist's journey would benefit from more internal complexity.</comment>
