<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchardist's character is well-developed through his vigilance, punctuality as rebellion against grief, and systematic approach to exposing the conspiracy. His motivation stemming from his sister's death creates a compelling psychological foundation. However, the character lacks some dimensionality - we see his methodical side but not enough emotional complexity beyond his grief transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects the peacock-patterned seal to the orchardist's demonstration method. The three-plane sequence provides a satisfying arc with escalating revelations. However, the conspiracy itself feels somewhat underdeveloped, with the leader's introduction and defeat happening too abruptly in the final moments, causing the resolution to feel rushed despite the overall coherent structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility and greenhouse of paper sheets create a distinctive, almost surreal setting that works surprisingly well with the conspiracy plot. The sensory detail of "the world smelled of ripe apples" effectively bridges the orchardist's two worlds. The atmosphere successfully blends the methodical with the whimsical through specific visual details like the crimson-striped plane and peacock imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the paper airplanes as both plot devices and metaphors for the character's emotional journey. The peacock motif creates a consistent symbolic through-line, and the transformation of grief into purpose delivers emotional impact. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, and some narrative transitions feel rushed, limiting its full thematic potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most obvious AI pitfalls, several lines have an overly formal quality ("vigilance could prune conspiracies as easily as weeds"). The conspiracy narrative follows somewhat predictable patterns, and the villain is rendered with limited complexity. The peacock metaphor, while original in application, becomes slightly mechanical in its systematic execution through the three planes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its many assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an emotional core. The peacock pattern creates a satisfying structure, and the orchardist's grief-to-purpose arc gives the story emotional weight. However, the brevity constraints lead to some underdeveloped aspects of the conspiracy and character relationships, preventing the story from achieving its full potential depth.</comment>
