<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mara's professional cuddler identity creates an interesting tension with her prejudice about those who don't seek touch. Her motivation to overcome this bias is clear, though her character development feels somewhat abstract rather than deeply realized. The phantom punch catalyst works symbolically, but her emotional journey lacks sufficient nuance and specific detail to make her transformation fully believable within this word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc—from Mara's encounter at the market to her epiphany before her speech—but several logical gaps undermine coherence. The market encounter feels rushed, and the connection between the phantom punch and her prejudice is more told than shown. While the metaphorical journey works conceptually, the cause-effect relationships between plot points need stronger connective tissue to create a truly satisfying narrative progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting creates a powerful atmosphere of forgotten potential that effectively mirrors Mara's internal journey. The imagery of "rusted cathedral" and "sleeping leviathans" establishes a hauntingly beautiful backdrop. The juxtaposition of the intimate profession of cuddling against this vast, empty space creates meaningful tension. The sensory details of amber light, dust, and echoing silence effectively create an immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story employs rich imagery and symbolism, particularly in connecting physical touch with emotional barriers. The phantom train punch as a metaphor for stamping/validating souls works brilliantly. However, the story sometimes prioritizes poetic language over clarity, creating moments where meaning becomes obscured. The ending achieves a sense of resolution, though it relies heavily on abstraction rather than concrete emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI patterns, it occasionally veers into purple prose ("echoing the hush," "decay into starlight") that prioritizes flowery language over authentic character development. Some metaphors feel strained rather than organic. The concept is genuinely creative, but the execution sometimes reads as self-consciously literary, with descriptions that aim for profundity but occasionally land as pretentious. The story shows originality in its premise but lacks the authentic human nuance needed for true distinction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The symbolic connections between touch, validation, and prejudice create a thoughtful framework. However, the execution sometimes sacrifices clarity for poetic effect, and certain plot connections feel underdeveloped. While the story creates a lingering impression with its imagery, it falls short of its full potential due to occasional opacity and insufficient grounding in concrete emotional detail.</comment>
