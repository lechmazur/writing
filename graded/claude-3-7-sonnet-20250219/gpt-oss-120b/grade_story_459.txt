<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's character development is thoughtfully integrated with her elevator technician/ghost-seer duality. Her elegantly clumsy attribute manifests well through specific actions like "tighten a bolt with the grace of a dancer while tripping over her own tools." Her motivation to find liberation through cataloguing ghosts creates psychological depth. However, her emotional journey feels somewhat rushed in the transition from observation to understanding, and her internal conflicts could be more fully explored rather than resolved so neatly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure creates a satisfying arc from Mara's ghost cataloguing to her revelation about letting go. The connection between elevator repair and sand castles creates an intriguing thematic parallel about preservation and impermanence. However, the central conflict lacks urgency, and the resolution feels somewhat accelerated in the final paragraphs, where her epiphany comes with minimal struggle. The story's progression from ghost observation to understanding feels more like a gentle slope than a dramatic arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, evocative setting that brilliantly parallels the story's themes of preservation, fragility, and impermanence. Sensory details are particularly strong, with "the quiet hum of machinery" competing with "the whisper of drifting dunes" and the ghost folding "into a thin sheet of sand, each grain a syllable." The atmosphere effectively blends the technical with the ethereal, though the actual physical space could be more precisely realized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storytelling employs rich metaphors that connect physical structures (elevators, sand castles) with emotional states. The central metaphor of ghosts as "unfinished sighs of the building's steel" and the transformation of the apparition into sand creates powerful symbolism. The theme of letting go emerges organically through these connections. However, the narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly in describing Mara's emotional revelations, and some metaphors feel slightly overworked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story presents an original concept in its combination of elevator repair and sand castle preservation, creating fresh connections between seemingly disparate elements. However, it occasionally slips into unnecessarily ornate language ("the dissonance dissolve into a simple, steady hum") and relies on somewhat predictable emotional epiphanies. The ghost's transformation into sand is a genuinely inventive moment, but other aspects of the narrative follow more conventional patterns of discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its diverse assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of preservation, impermanence, and letting go. The parallel between elevators and sand castles creates a memorable central metaphor. The story leaves readers with thoughtful connections between the physical and spiritual worlds. However, the narrative would benefit from more tension or conflict to drive Mara's journey, and the resolution feels somewhat too neat for the complex themes being explored.</comment>
