<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's character is well-developed through her conflicted relationship with her past. Her herbalist identity contrasts effectively with her father's pharmaceutical background, creating meaningful tension. Her academically artistic nature manifests in her attention to detail and her approach to restoration. However, some aspects of her emotional journey feel slightly rushed within the constraints, particularly the transition from shame to acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves elegantly from wall restoration to personal restoration, with the letters serving as an effective narrative device. The story achieves a complete arc despite its brevity, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The wall as both literal and metaphorical construct works particularly well, transforming from barrier to bridge in a way that parallels Lila's internal journey. The ending provides satisfying resolution while maintaining emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coral restoration station creates a rich backdrop that perfectly complements the themes of repair and renewal. Sensory details are exceptional—the generator's hum, saltwater pooling, the wall's groaning—creating immersive atmosphere. The setting functions as both literal workspace and metaphorical landscape for Lila's emotional journey. The connection between coral restoration and personal restoration is subtly but effectively established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—particularly the wall as both barrier and bridge, and stitching as both practical craft and emotional healing. The central conflict between Lila's chosen path and her father's expectations is well-established. The theme of transforming shame into connection emerges organically. The ending achieves emotional resonance without becoming sentimental. Some metaphors occasionally border on being too explicit rather than allowing readers to make connections.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of coral restoration with personal healing. The metaphors are generally fresh, particularly the connection between stitching and coral branches. However, some phrasing occasionally feels slightly overwrought ("the sea were laughing"), and certain emotional transitions could benefit from more subtlety. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout, avoiding the formulaic patterns typical of AI writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity serves the story well, creating a focused meditation on healing and transformation. The emotional journey from shame to acceptance is handled with nuance, and the ending leaves readers with lingering questions about how Lila will continue to transform her relationship with her past. Some transitions between elements could be smoother, but overall the integration is skillful.</comment>
