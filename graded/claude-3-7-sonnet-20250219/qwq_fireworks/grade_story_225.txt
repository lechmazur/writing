<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's characterization as a wayward apothecary is well-integrated, with her scientific knowledge and moral complexity driving the narrative. Her conflicted relationship with the crew who destroyed her shop yet whom she still helps shows nuanced motivation. However, her emotional journey could be more deeply explored beyond the final paragraph's somewhat abrupt revelation about fairness and love.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the infection concept to create tension, with the Morse code signals and butterfly migration forming a coherent narrative arc. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, moving from discovery to conflict to resolution with logical progression. The protagonist's realization and choice at the end provides satisfying closure while maintaining internal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered through "clanking pistons," "groaning rivets," and the brass observation rail. The post-treaty world creates a lawless atmosphere that perfectly frames the moral choices. Sensory details like the butterflies' "wings glinting like fractured sapphires" create immersive atmosphere that enhances both the beauty and danger of the scenario.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of mercy versus vengeance, with the highlighter pen serving as both literal tool and metaphor for healing. The subtext of choosing peace when surrounded by conflict resonates powerfully. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments like "the explosion that had gutted her apothecary's den—and killed her partner—still smoldered in her ribs," which conveys emotional weight through physical sensation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its steampunk-meets-ecological warfare concept and the creative use of the highlighter as neutralizer. However, some metaphors ("their shared history a tangled net") feel somewhat familiar, and the final paragraph's philosophical musings on fairness and love veer slightly toward telling rather than showing. The prose occasionally becomes ornate ("the deck's groan harmonizing with the Morse code's urgency").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The steampunk setting, weaponized butterflies, and the apothecary's moral dilemma create a distinctive world with emotional resonance. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated impact. The lingering questions about reconciliation and the protagonist's future choices give the piece depth beyond its word count.</comment>
