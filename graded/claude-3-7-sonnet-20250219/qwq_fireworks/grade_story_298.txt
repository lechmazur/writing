<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chameleon stage actor's character is effectively shaped by her "rationally impulsive" nature, driving her methodical yet spontaneous investigation. Her theatrical background meaningfully informs her approach to solving the mystery through performance and inhabitation of different personas. However, her personal stakes in this investigation remain somewhat underdeveloped, and her emotional journey lacks sufficient depth beyond her professional methodology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mystery plot has a clear arc with the discovery of the dress leading to the revelation about the prince's fate. The integration of theatrical reproduction as investigative method is innovative. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and relies on convenient revelations (the constellation pattern) rather than earned insights. The oil depletion timeframe creates urgency but isn't fully integrated into the plot's mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decaying Chinese palace is rendered with vivid, sensory-rich details that effectively merge with the post-oil apocalyptic timeframe. The contrast between ancient grandeur and environmental collapse creates a compelling atmosphere. Particularly strong is how the physical setting (light through debris, crumbling architecture) mirrors the fragmentary nature of the mystery itself. The palace becomes a character in its own right.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story employs sophisticated literary techniques, particularly in its use of the dress as both literal clue and metaphorical connection to the past. The theatrical framing device adds layers to the investigation. While the emotional impact is strong, the resolution relies too heavily on convenient revelations rather than earned insights. The theme of preserving truth amid environmental collapse is compelling but could be more fully developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the prose demonstrates considerable craft with evocative imagery, it occasionally veers into purple territory ("its stones releasing centuries of secrets into the wind"). The central metaphor of performance as investigation is original, but the mystery's resolution through celestial navigation feels somewhat contrived. The story avoids most AI-typical patterns but occasionally relies on overly formal phrasing and convenient plot developments that undermine its authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with literary ambition. Its strengths lie in atmospheric world-building and the innovative use of theatrical performance as investigative method. However, it falls short of excellence due to some rushed plot developments, occasional purple prose, and insufficient exploration of the protagonist's personal stakes. The ending, while poetic, relies more on convenient revelation than earned insight.</comment>
