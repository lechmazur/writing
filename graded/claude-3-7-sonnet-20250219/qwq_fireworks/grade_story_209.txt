<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-developed through his connection to his sister and his dedication to mapping railways. His motivation is clear and consistent, driven by grief and a promise. The hairbrush serves as both a physical and emotional tether, revealing his sentimentality and determination. However, some aspects of his personality remain underdeveloped, particularly how his decades of solitary work shaped him beyond his connection to Lila.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the short-circuit as a catalyst for revelation. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from Elias's search to his emotional resolution. The connection between the hairbrush, radio waves, and railways creates a coherent framework. The pacing manages the transition from physical quest to emotional epiphany smoothly, though the exact mechanics of how the brush works could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates a hauntingly surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements the themes of communication beyond death. Sensory details are exceptionalâ€”the tower's "iron skin peeling like dead skin," the "static hummed through wildflowers," and the "salt and static on his lips" create a vivid, otherworldly setting. The integration of electromagnetic phenomena with natural imagery creates a unique liminal space that enhances the emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of grief, connection, and letting go. The hairbrush as a conduit between worlds works as both literal tool and powerful metaphor. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution that transcends the physical quest. The writing employs evocative imagery and symbolism throughout. The theme of finding truth through unconventional means is well-developed, though some metaphors occasionally border on overworked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of electromagnetic railway mapping and the radio garden. The prose avoids AI-typical patterns, with consistent tone and authentic emotional nuance. Metaphors like the tower's "iron skin peeling like dead skin" feel fresh and specific. The narrative maintains human complexity in its treatment of grief. A few phrases like "salt and static on his lips" verge on purple prose, but generally, the language serves the story's emotional and thematic purposes without becoming formulaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The surreal elements enhance rather than distract from the emotional core. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated emotional experience. The lingering impression is of a man finding peace through acceptance rather than continued pursuit, giving the piece depth beyond its explicit narrative. Minor clarity issues with the brush's exact function prevent a higher score.</comment>
