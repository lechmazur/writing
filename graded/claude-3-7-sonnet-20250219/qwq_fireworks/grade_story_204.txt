<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's character as a professional cuddler who paradoxically operates in a touch-averse society creates compelling internal conflict. Her reluctance toward recognition and her journey to embrace her profession's value show meaningful development. However, her transformation feels somewhat accelerated, and we could benefit from more insight into her specific insecurities beyond general discomfort with attention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Lira's reluctance to her epiphany and public declaration, with the ticket punch serving as an effective catalyst. The encounter with the Vrynn provides necessary momentum. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed—her transformation from avoiding the spotlight to confidently addressing the crowd happens with minimal resistance or complication, diminishing some dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar creates a hauntingly effective backdrop that mirrors the story's themes of connection and disconnection. The "skeletal beams crisscrossing like ribs of some long-dead creature" establishes both physical setting and emotional tone brilliantly. The market's existence within this decayed transportation hub reinforces the theme of lost connections waiting to be rediscovered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of touch, connection, and societal taboos with nuanced symbolism. The ticket punch as a device that "reveals paths forgotten" works on multiple levels. The ending delivers emotional resonance with Lira's public declaration. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly when explaining the significance of touch rather than demonstrating its impact through more concrete interactions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of a professional cuddler in a touch-averse society is original, some elements feel predictable—particularly the "outsider helps protagonist see their true worth" structure. The Vrynn character, while visually striking with "scales like molten copper, eyes twin supernovas," delivers wisdom in a somewhat formulaic manner. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("voice like static through a damaged comm") without adding substantive depth to the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about connection and authenticity. The spaceport setting, professional cuddler character, and ticket punch object work together particularly well. The story leaves readers with meaningful reflections on touch as a fundamental human need. However, the resolution comes too easily, with the crowd's enthusiastic reception feeling somewhat unearned given the established societal taboos around touch.</comment>
