<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The necromancer's meekness is consistently portrayed through her trembling actions and shuffling movements, while her sincere gaze becomes a meaningful character trait that disarms the goblin child. Her motivation to save her dying sister provides clear purpose, though her transformation from meek to empowered at the end could have been more gradually developed rather than suddenly occurring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from problem (dying sister, lost incantation) to solution (decoding the riddle through the dew drop's reflection). The action of regaining the lost incantation drives the narrative forward with logical cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the riddle's introduction and resolution providing effective bookends.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly realized through sensory details like bioluminescent fungi, damp stone, and the dissonant playground sounds. The setting perfectly complements the mystic simplicity tone, creating an otherworldly atmosphere where magic feels natural. The juxtaposition of necromancy against childlike playground sounds creates a compelling tonal contrast that enhances the story's emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tapestry as both literal object and metaphor for interconnection between life and death. The prose shows rather than tells, particularly in how the necromancer's emotions manifest physically. The theme of finding truth in spaces between opposites (light/shadow, life/death) emerges organically. The ending satisfies emotionally while maintaining the mystical tone established throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fresh approach to necromancy and the unexpected connection between a child's marble, dew, and magical revelation. The prose occasionally becomes slightly ornate ("its voice like gravel and honey"), but generally maintains purposeful language that serves the narrative. The goblin child character avoids typical fantasy tropes, offering genuine help rather than trickery or riddles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole where each component feels essential rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused narrative with surprising emotional depth. The mystic simplicity tone is maintained throughout, and the story leaves readers with lingering questions about the nature of the spaces between opposites that give it resonance beyond its word count.</comment>
