<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's sincerity is established immediately and remains consistent throughout. Her motivation to preserve the library is clear and drives her actions logically. Her confrontation with her mother's ghost reveals emotional depth and personal stakes. However, her character could be more distinctively drawn—her voice lacks uniqueness, and we learn little about her beyond her mission. The rebellion aspect feels somewhat underdeveloped despite being central to her character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Mara entering the passage to successfully preserving the library. The theorizing action effectively drives discovery of the "storm's eye" ritual. However, the resolution feels rushed—the transition from finding the charter to saving the building happens too abruptly. The cause-effect relationship between reciting the oath and the library's salvation lacks sufficient explanation, leaving a logical gap in an otherwise coherent narrative structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage is vividly realized through sensory details like "mildew and old paper" and walls that "whispered with the weight of unspoken histories." The constantly changing setting physically manifests the story's themes of tradition versus progress. The atmosphere of decay and preservation perfectly complements the core concept and enhances Mara's motivation. The storm timeframe is subtly but effectively woven throughout, culminating meaningfully in the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the library as a metaphor for cultural memory and tradition. The shifting walls create tension and symbolize resistance to change. The ghost confrontation delivers emotional impact, though the resolution feels somewhat too neat. The theme of preserving while adapting ("Some traditions needed bending, not breaking") offers meaningful subtext. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing in key moments, particularly during the climactic ritual, diminishing its potential impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls but contains some generic phrasing ("voice like rustling pages") and predictable metaphors. The emotional handling sometimes defaults to stating feelings rather than showing them. While the concept of a living, shifting library is intriguing, the ghost confrontation follows a somewhat formulaic pattern. The ending, with its neat resolution and glowing note, veers into cliché territory. The writing shows flashes of originality but lacks a consistently distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about preservation and adaptation. The haunted passage and shifting walls create a compelling backdrop for Mara's mission. However, the resolution feels rushed and relies on convenient plot mechanics. While the story achieves emotional resonance through Mara's connection to her mother, some aspects feel underdeveloped given the constraints. The central theme of bending rather than breaking traditions provides a satisfying philosophical underpinning, though it could be more subtly conveyed.</comment>
