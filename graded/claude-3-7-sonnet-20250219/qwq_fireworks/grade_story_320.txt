<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's character as a shy diviner is subtly established through her actions rather than explicit statements.

The cause-effect relationships between parallel timelines and Lira's actions are clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater market is exceptionally realized with vivid, specific details like "coral stalls" and vendors with prices "etched in languages that dissolved when touched." The setting perfectly complements the concept of blurring timelines and regret. The atmosphere of submersion mirrors Lira's emotional state, and sensory details like the "dim glow" and "kelp-paved crossroads" create an immersive, dreamlike quality that enhances the story's themes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its approach to parallel timelines and the underwater market setting. The writing avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and nuanced emotion. Metaphors like "regret was the lens, not the subject" feel fresh and specific to this narrative.
