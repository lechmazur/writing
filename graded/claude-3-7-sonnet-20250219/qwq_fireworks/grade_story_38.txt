<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is well-established through her actions and environment. Her insomnia drives her obsession with the plants and their whispers, creating a consistent motivation. However, her character lacks deeper psychological exploration—we understand what she does but less about who she is beyond her defining trait. Her voice in dialogue is distinctive ("You first"), but we need more insight into her internal transformation beyond her physical actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution, with the poet's journey to eliminate violence through understanding rather than force. The connection between the whispering plants, subway tracks built on bones, and non-violent revolution creates coherent cause-and-effect. However, the middle section feels rushed—the leap from the engineer's confession to the poet's solution lacks sufficient development, and the resolution comes too easily given the gravity of the buried history.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway setting create a compelling atmosphere of liminality that enhances the story's themes. The contrast between the isolated attic and public subway spaces works effectively. Sensory details are particularly strong—plants with "petals pulsed faintly," sap that's "sticky and persistent," and tracks "overgrown with flora." The atmosphere successfully balances supernatural elements with urban decay, creating a distinctive world where the impossible feels plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses botanical imagery as metaphor throughout, creating resonant symbolism between buried histories and persistent plant life. The theme of non-violent revolution through listening and attention is well-developed. The ending provides satisfying resolution while maintaining subtlety. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by the rapid progression of events in the latter half, and some key moments (like the city's transformation) rely more on telling than showing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central conceit of plants as messengers from forgotten victims. However, several phrases ("edges blurred," "voice fraying") feel formulaic, and the resolution follows a somewhat predictable pattern of enlightenment leading to societal transformation. The narrative occasionally slips into telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the city's change. While the botanical metaphors are initially fresh, they become repetitive by the story's end, suggesting limited variation in the symbolic framework.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive atmosphere and compelling central metaphor. The botanical samples and subway setting create a unique framework for exploring themes of historical violence and healing. However, the rushed middle section and somewhat predictable resolution prevent it from reaching its full potential. The story leaves readers with the lingering idea that attention itself can be revolutionary, but would benefit from more nuanced development of its central transformation.</comment>
