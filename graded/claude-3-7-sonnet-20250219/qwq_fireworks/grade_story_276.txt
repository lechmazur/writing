<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emissary's guilt over a past miscalculation drives her actions convincingly, creating a clear motivation for redemption. Her methodical personality manifests in how she arranges postcards and approaches data. However, her emotional journey feels somewhat underdeveloped—we see her determination but get limited insight into her internal transformation beyond functional reactions to plot developments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the postcard discovery to the debris pattern revelation and ultimate rescue mission, creating a satisfying arc. The "lurch" action serves as both physical movement and metaphorical shift in understanding. However, the transition from pattern recognition to rescue mission feels rushed, with insufficient explanation of how exactly the patterns led to the survivors' discovery, weakening the logical progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orbital debris station setting is richly utilized, with excellent integration of the technical environment and personal space (kitchen with postcards). The atmosphere effectively balances scientific precision with emotional weight. Sensory details like the "cold" wire hanger and "crackling" static create immersive moments, though more consistent sensory grounding throughout would strengthen the world-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses debris as both literal hazard and metaphor for unresolved past, creating meaningful subtext. The transformation from "tracking to listening" offers thematic resonance about communication and connection. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by telling rather than showing in key moments, particularly in the final paragraph where the significance is stated rather than demonstrated through character reactions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the space debris/postcard connection shows originality, the narrative relies on some predictable elements—the guilt-driven protagonist seeking redemption, the miraculous discovery of survivors. The writing occasionally defaults to telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific reactions. The "message in the debris" concept, while interesting, follows a somewhat formulaic pattern-recognition plot without sufficient unique complications or nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional stakes. The connection between postcards and debris patterns creates an intriguing central metaphor. However, the brevity constrains full development of the rescue mission's challenges and the protagonist's emotional journey, leaving some promising ideas underdeveloped. The ending feels somewhat rushed and overly neat given the complexity of the setup.</comment>
