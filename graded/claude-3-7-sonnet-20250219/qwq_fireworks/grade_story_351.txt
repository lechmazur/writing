<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dreamy poet's character is well-established through her interactions with the sundial and letter. Her "formally rebellious" attribute manifests naturally in her history of burning letters and her eventual commitment to preserving forgotten stories. Her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" develops organically through her discoveries. However, we lack deeper insight into her personal history or why she's specifically drawn to this station initially.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure follows a clear progression from discovery to resolution, with each riddle advancing the narrative logically. The compulsion via cryptic shapes drives the action effectively, creating a treasure hunt that reveals the station's secrets. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the beginning (finding the letter) connecting meaningfully to the end (becoming the preserver of forgotten stories). The pacing feels deliberate rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station is rendered with exceptional sensory detail—moss-veiled brass, ivy clinging to rusted rails, the air humming with memory. The setting perfectly complements both the sundial object and the concept of preserving forgotten stories. The atmosphere of abandonment and lingering presence supports the quietly intense tone and creates a liminal space where past and present merge. The sensory elements are specific and evocative without becoming purple prose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sundial as both literal object and metaphor for time's passage and memory. The transformation of the sundial into a quill creates a powerful symbol for the poet's new purpose. The narrative shows rather than tells the emotional weight of discovery through "hands trembled—not with fear, but with the weight of standing by the unremembered." The theme of preserving erased histories emerges organically from the narrative elements rather than being stated explicitly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh imagery and consistent tone. However, some phrases like "delicate undoing" and "formally rebellious soul" feel slightly manufactured. The narrative occasionally relies on somewhat predictable ghost story elements, though it subverts expectations by focusing on preservation rather than exorcism. The emotional resonance feels genuine, particularly in the ghosts' statement "We were never lost, only unspoken," which avoids melodrama while conveying poignancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The brevity works as a strength, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the narrative. The ending leaves readers with the lingering image of the poet continuing her work indefinitely, suggesting themes about art's role in preserving memory. While occasionally verging on the precious, the story maintains enough grounding in concrete detail to avoid becoming overly sentimental.</comment>
