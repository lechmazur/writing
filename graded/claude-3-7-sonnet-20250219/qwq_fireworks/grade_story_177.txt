<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's character is well-developed through her rebellious nature and clear motivation to restore choice through her obituaries. Her relationship with the mask reveals internal conflict and growth. However, we could benefit from more insight into her background and what personally drives her rebellion beyond abstract ideals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Elena's discovery to her transformation into an agent of change. The narrative arc is complete within the word constraint, with the mask and organ serving as effective catalysts. The resolution feels earned, though the giant's sudden appearance and defeat happens somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building creates a surreal yet tangible setting. The giant's bookshelf as repository of human choices, the resonant organ, and the mask's shifting expressions all contribute to a richly atmospheric narrative. Sensory details like the humming books and the mask's physical transformations create immersive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (books as lives, the mask as transformation) and creates emotional resonance through Elena's defiance. The central metaphor of obituaries as both endings and beginnings is particularly strong. The theme of choice versus determinism is well-explored, though some metaphors occasionally border on being too abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, some phrasing feels overly ornate ("vertiginous spiral," "a language of fractures"). The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the revolution beyond the bookshelf. However, the core concept and its execution remain fresh and distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated, impactful narrative. The lingering questions about the nature of choice and rebellion provide intellectual depth beyond the immediate story.</comment>
