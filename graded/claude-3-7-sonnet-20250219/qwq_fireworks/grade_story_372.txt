<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lovelorn spy's character is well-established through her grief-numbed indifference that paradoxically drives her actions. Her motivation to find her lover is clear and consistent. However, her emotional journey from numbness to determination feels somewhat rushed, and her dialogue is minimal, limiting our access to her distinct voice. The character's relationship with the antagonist remains underdeveloped, reducing the impact of their confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves efficiently from pursuit to revelation to climactic action. The avalanche metaphor works effectively as both literal threat and symbolic representation of corporate destruction. However, the story's brevity forces some logical leaps—particularly in how quickly she discovers the corporation's involvement and her ability to hack and redirect the avalanche. The ending, while thematically resonant, feels somewhat abrupt in its resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk slum setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like "neon rain," "rusted walls," and the "ozone and desperation" smell. The futuristic elements blend seamlessly with the decaying urban landscape. The atmosphere of technological decay perfectly complements the spy's emotional state and mission. Particularly effective is how the setting elements (servers, access panels, reflections) become integral to the plot rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the avalanche as both literal threat and metaphor for unstoppable corporate power. The reflections motif creates a haunting subtext about memory and perception. The ending delivers emotional impact through its suggestion of hope amid destruction. However, the brevity constrains character development, and some metaphors (particularly around the "new recipe" of betrayal) feel underdeveloped rather than subtly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and specific sensory details. The cyberpunk elements feel authentic rather than generic. However, certain phrases ("grief fueling keystrokes") verge on cliché, and the antagonist's dialogue occasionally falls into villain stereotypes. The emotional progression from numbness to determination could benefit from more nuanced showing rather than telling. The story's originality lies in its effective integration of the sticky label as both plot device and symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The cyberpunk setting and avalanche metaphor work particularly well together. While the brevity necessitates some narrative shortcuts, the story maintains internal logic and builds to a satisfying conclusion that balances destruction with hope. The lingering question of whether she'll find her lover gives the ending emotional weight beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
