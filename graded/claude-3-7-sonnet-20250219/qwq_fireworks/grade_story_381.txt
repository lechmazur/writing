<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The necromancer's character is well-developed through her relationship with memory, nostalgia, and persistence. Her motivation to map the caves is clear and consistent, with the baseball cap serving as both a physical and emotional tether to her past. The character's quiet determination and use of film references as spells reveals her unique approach to necromancy. However, we could benefit from more insight into what initially drove her to this mapping quest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from mapping to confrontation to resolution, with the action of domination manifesting subtly through the necromancer's interaction with the crystal creature. The story achieves a sense of completeness despite its brevity. The connection between the beginning (mapping) and end (completing the map) creates satisfying closure. However, the middle section's transition from mapping to confrontation feels slightly rushed, and the stakes could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is exceptionally well-realized through sensory details like glinting walls, echoing drips, and prismatic dust. The juxtaposition of ancient magic with movie references creates the perfect atmosphere for "futuristic nostalgia." The cave's properties—responding to energy, projecting films, defying gravity—are consistently portrayed and meaningfully connected to both the character's abilities and emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of film projection to explore themes of memory, persistence, and connection beyond death. The ending achieves emotional resonance through its ambiguity—suggesting both completion and continuation. The conflict between isolation and connection is subtly woven throughout. The story shows rather than tells the necromancer's emotions through her actions and the environment's response. The central theme of preserving connections through shared cultural touchpoints emerges organically from the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of necromancy with cinematic nostalgia. The writing avoids common fantasy tropes by reimagining necromancy as a cartographic and preservationist art. However, some descriptions ("crystallized into a decision") verge on cliché, and the crystal creature's transformation feels somewhat predictable. The emotional core feels authentic, but certain transitions between scenes could be more naturally integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The brevity works in its favor, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the setting and character. The lingering questions about the necromancer's partner and the true nature of the "screen where the story truly began" provide depth beyond the explicit narrative. While some elements could be more deeply explored, the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking and emotional resonance.</comment>
