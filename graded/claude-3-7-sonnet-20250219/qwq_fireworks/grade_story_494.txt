<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman's character is well-developed through his physical presence, internal conflict, and transformation. His doubtful confidence manifests in his demanding exterior masking uncertainty. The revelation about his family history provides meaningful context for his motivation. However, his transformation feels slightly rushed within the constraints, and his dialogue occasionally lacks the distinctive voice that would elevate him to a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves with impressive coherence from confrontation to transformation. The tapestry fragment serves as both object and plot device, while the authorization action drives the narrative forward organically. The story achieves a complete arc within tight constraints, with the swordsman's journey from arrogance to self-discovery feeling earned. The cause-effect relationship between learning the song and unlocking his potential is particularly well-executed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work creates a vivid sensory experience. The courtyard setting with "ink and frost" scents, gravel crunching underfoot, and "skeletal branches of winter" establishes a perfect backdrop for the narrative. The calligraphy master's domain reinforces themes of tradition and artistry. The harsh tenderness tone manifests beautifully in both setting details and character interactions, creating a world that feels simultaneously austere and intimate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through its layered symbolism (the tapestry as family history, ink as transformation) and thematic depth exploring heritage, pride, and self-discovery. The ending delivers emotional resonance with the swordsman becoming "more than a blade." The story effectively shows rather than tells emotional states. While the conflict resolution works well, some metaphors ("approval rare as dawn on a stormy sea") feel slightly overwrought, preventing a perfect score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns through its consistent tone and specific sensory details. The metaphors are generally fresh ("inkstone glinted like a forgotten star") and the emotional progression feels authentic rather than stated. However, occasional phrases like "harsh as stone yet tender as a wound" edge toward purple prose, and some transitions between the swordsman's internal realizations feel slightly accelerated in a way that suggests compression rather than organic development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The elements feel essential rather than forced, particularly the tapestry fragment and the song as keys to unlocking potential. The brevity serves the story well, creating a focused meditation on heritage and self-discovery. The lingering image of the swordsman with the tapestry "trailing behind him like a flag" provides a resonant conclusion that extends beyond the page.</comment>
