<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ember's character is well-established through her connection to her mother's legacy and her relationship with the stones. Her motivation to stabilize gravity feels authentic, though her emotional journey could be more nuanced. The character shows growth from fear to acceptance, but her "aloof orphan" quality isn't fully developed beyond basic backstory elements. Her voice remains somewhat distant despite the personal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the "loosen" action when the stone rolls free, triggering the discovery that drives the narrative. The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with clear cause-effect relationships between the stones, the gravitational anomaly, and Ember's actions. The resolution feels earned rather than rushed, though the mechanics of how the stones actually work remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a distinctive, unsettling atmosphere that permeates the story. Sensory details like the tilted roof, floating basketball, and humming stones effectively establish both the physical setting and emotional tone. The garage becomes more than backdropâ€”it's integral to the plot and character journey, with its transformation mirroring Ember's internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the stones as both literal tools and metaphorical anchors, creating layers of meaning about stability and connection. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in moments like Ember's tears on the lottery ticket. While the theme of honoring the past while moving forward is clear, some metaphors (like "fear clawed at her ribs") feel somewhat conventional. The story shows rather than tells Ember's emotional journey, though some transitions between emotional states could be more developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, with consistent tone and logical progression. However, some phrases like "fear clawed at her ribs" and "tears warm against the lottery ticket" feel somewhat generic. The gravitational anomaly concept is original, but the emotional resolution follows a predictable pattern of acceptance and growth. The writing occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through more specific, unique details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The gravitational anomaly serves as both literal setting and metaphor for Ember's emotional state. While the prose occasionally relies on familiar emotional descriptors, the core concept of adaptation is thoughtfully explored. The ending effectively balances resolution with forward momentum, leaving the reader with a sense of both completion and continuation.</comment>
