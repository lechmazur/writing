<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scholar's character is well-established through their actions and internal conflict between duty and defiance. Their motivation to reveal a forbidden truth is consistent and drives their decisions. However, their emotional depth could be further developed, and we get limited insight into their background or what personally connects them to this drowned city.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively balances exposition and action within the tight word count. The contamination action drives the narrative forward with clear cause-effect relationships. The arc feels complete from the scholar's initial decision through to their choice to abandon certification, with the tension building logically to a satisfying resolution that reinforces the theme.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting is richly rendered with specific sensory details like "fluorescent lights hummed" and the creaking well. The futuristic time-travel setting contrasts effectively with the ancient well, creating a compelling atmosphere of tension between preservation and erasure. The world feels lived-in and the atmosphere supports the clandestine nature of the scholar's mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of historical truth versus sanctioned narratives, with strong metaphorical language ("truth is a virus"). The ending provides meaningful resolution while leaving space for reader reflection. The central conflict between institutional control and historical truth is well-developed. However, some metaphors like "truth's seeds had taken root" verge on clich√©, and certain emotional moments could benefit from more showing rather than telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases feel somewhat formulaic ("their breath hitched"). The concept of a drowned city and time-travel regulation is interesting but not entirely original. The writing occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific physical reactions. The prose is generally strong but occasionally veers toward purple ("the unspoken heart swell in their chest").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear thematic purpose. The time-travel framework provides a fresh context for exploring censorship and historical truth. The brevity works well for the story's scope, though some elements (like the mentor's words) feel slightly underdeveloped. The final line effectively ties together the "earthbound flight" concept with the story's themes of liberation through truth.</comment>
