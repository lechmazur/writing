<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watchman's character arc from envious enforcer to someone who learns to appreciate others' talents is well-executed. His transformation feels earned through specific moments of internal conflict, particularly when he redirects the worker with similar fingerprints. His jealousy and subsequent growth are consistently portrayed through concrete actions rather than mere statements, though his initial confidence could have been more pronounced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from the watchman's jealous control to his transformation, with the cracked ruler serving as an effective symbol of his character arc. The story achieves a satisfying resolution within the tight word count, showing how the protagonist evolves from enforcing rigid order to appreciating diversity. The cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the middle section could be tightened slightly to enhance the impact of his transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The beehive setting is exceptionally realized through sensory details that create a unique, immersive atmosphere. The hexagonal chambers, the pulsing heart, the eternal twilight, and the symphony of colors all contribute to a richly textured world. The setting perfectly complements both the hierarchical structure needed for the plot and the visual metaphor of colors representing individual talents. The integration of the microscope and fingerprints within this world feels organic rather than forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its extended metaphor of colors representing individual talents and the ruler symbolizing rigid control. The emotional journey from envy to appreciation resonates strongly, and the prose balances lyricism with clarity. The subtext about leadership, control, and recognizing others' gifts adds significant thematic weight. The final image of the softened ruler edges creates a lasting impression, though some sentences in the middle section could be more economical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its fantastical setting and the integration of fingerprint patterns as determinants of artistic ability. The prose avoids clich√©s and creates fresh imagery throughout. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than formulaic, with nuanced handling of the watchman's internal conflict. The metaphors (particularly the cracked ruler reflecting the protagonist's flawed perspective) are inventive and purposeful rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The beehive setting, fingerprint analysis, and coloring sessions work together to create a unique world that serves the emotional journey at the core of the narrative. The prose style balances evocative imagery with narrative momentum, and the story achieves thematic resonance about leadership, envy, and personal growth within its tight constraints. Minor refinements to pacing in the middle section would elevate it further.</comment>
