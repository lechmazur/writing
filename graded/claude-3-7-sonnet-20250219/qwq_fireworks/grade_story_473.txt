<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's character is well-developed through her calculated unpredictability and leadership burden. Her actions—planting a sapling during a zoning meeting, encoding dissent in brochures—reveal her rebellious nature and commitment to the orchard. Her internal conflict about leadership adds depth, though her emotional arc could be more fully realized in such a short piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses pruning as both literal action and metaphor for leadership choices. The narrative flows logically from Elara's mapping and workshops to her strategic resistance against solar development, culminating in the ritual handshake that symbolizes her approach to leadership. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard overshadowed by solar panels creates a vivid, tension-filled setting that perfectly embodies the story's themes. Sensory details—boots crunching gravel, sap oozing from bark, apples "tart with defiance"—immerse readers in this world where nature and technology compete. The atmosphere of resistance and resilience permeates every description, creating a cohesive environmental backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in equating pruning with leadership decisions and the handshake ritual with resistance. The central conflict between preservation and development is well-established, with the ending providing a satisfying resolution that suggests ongoing resistance. The theme of finding power in spaces between choices resonates throughout, though some dialogue feels slightly stilted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, avoiding predictable environmental narrative tropes. The metaphors feel fresh—particularly the maps folding into propaganda and apples "tart with defiance." The writing maintains consistent tone and style, with specific sensory details grounding the narrative. Some phrases occasionally edge toward purple prose, but generally, the language serves the story's purpose effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The urban orchard setting, secret handshake manual, and leadership burden work together to create a narrative with depth beyond its brief length. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about resistance and adaptation, suggesting complexity beyond the explicit narrative. Some minor phrasing issues prevent it from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
