<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The morbid florist's character is well-established through her profession and perspective on death. Her transformation from viewing death as an end to seeing it as part of a cycle shows meaningful development. However, the "neutrally passionate" attribute feels somewhat underdeveloped—it's mentioned but doesn't consistently shape her actions throughout. Her motivation becomes clearer as the story progresses, but her initial reasons for fulfilling this specific client's wish could be more compelling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the action of "obliging" to drive the narrative forward, with the protagonist fulfilling a dying wish that transforms her understanding. The method of deciphering the writer's pages creates natural tension with the guttering lantern. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints—from the florist's arrival to her spiritual/philosophical transformation. The ending provides meaningful resolution while maintaining thematic coherence with the beginning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo creates an immediately distinctive and atmospheric setting that enhances the story's metaphysical themes. The timeframe of the guttering lantern adds urgency and symbolism. Sensory details are particularly strong—the salt and ink smell contrasting with expected decay, the humming rock, the stars "wheeled like scattered seeds." The setting and atmosphere perfectly complement the cosmic cycle concept and the character's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the florist's profession as metaphor for her philosophical journey, with particularly strong imagery connecting death, cycles, and plant life. The central conflict between viewing death as an end versus a continuation is well-developed. The ending's image of planting lilies in rock crevices provides a powerful resolution that embodies the theme. The writing shows rather than tells the character's emotional transformation, though some passages could be more concise to enhance impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central conceit and setting. The metaphors connecting floristry to cosmic cycles feel fresh and purposeful. However, some phrasing becomes overly ornate ("the dojo's stones as frozen breaths of ancient gods"), and certain transitions feel slightly formulaic. The contrasting attributes ("boldly timid," "neutrally passionate") sometimes read as artificially constructed rather than organically developed character traits. Overall, the story maintains a consistent tone and avoids major AI-writing hallmarks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores meaningful themes about mortality and cosmic continuity. The floating rock dojo and the morbid florist work particularly well together, creating a unique narrative space. The brevity feels purposeful rather than limiting. While some philosophical passages verge on being too abstract, the concrete imagery of planting lilies grounds the story's more esoteric concepts. The ending leaves readers with lingering questions about cycles and continuity that extend beyond the narrative.</comment>
