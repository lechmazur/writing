<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's character is shaped by his relationship with loss, effectively conveyed through his interaction with the sea glass. His motivation to extract radiance from doubt is consistent and drives his actions. However, his personality lacks some dimensionality—we understand what drives him but have limited insight into who he is beyond his quest. His emotional journey is present but could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "recommence" action to drive Eli's search forward. The narrative achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, moving from discovery to understanding to resolution. The cause-effect relationships are logical, particularly how the sea glass leads to the microfilm which leads to the extraction protocol. The pacing manages the transition between observatory corridors, vault, and deck without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting creates a compelling atmosphere of isolation and liminality that perfectly complements the theme of loss. Sensory details are particularly strong—the hum vibrating in Eli's ribs, corridors smelling of ozone and desperation, the cold glow of dying stars. The sea glass and observatory are meaningfully connected through the imagery of what is lost and found. The setting enhances both the physical action and metaphysical concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the sea glass as both literal object and metaphor for loss and memory. The central conflict between holding on and letting go is well-developed, with the resolution offering genuine emotional catharsis. The line "The upside of loss is the space it leaves for what remains" provides thematic resonance that elevates the narrative. The story skillfully shows rather than tells Eli's emotional journey through his physical interactions with the glass and observatory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh imagery and consistent tone. The metaphor of doubt as a black hole feels original, and the sensory details are specific rather than generic. However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward purple prose ("its blue hue a ghost of some ship's shattered dream"). The emotional arc feels authentic rather than stated, though the ending's cyclical nature is somewhat predictable. The story maintains a distinctive voice throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The sea glass, observatory, and extraction protocol work together to create a narrative about processing loss that resonates beyond its brief length. The metaphysical concept is grounded in concrete imagery and action. While occasionally verging on overwrought language, the story leaves the reader with a lingering emotional resonance and philosophical question about the nature of loss and what remains.</comment>
