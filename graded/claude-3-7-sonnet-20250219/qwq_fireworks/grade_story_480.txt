<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara has a distinct presence as a character with her fedora, toolkit, and methodical approach, but her internal motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped. Her "indifferent enthusiasm" is hinted at but not fully explored. We understand she's an exorcist following clues, but her deeper character traits and personal stakes aren't fully revealed within the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery of the receipt to confrontation with the ghost to receiving a new assignment. The narrative maintains coherence despite its brevity, with the receipt effectively driving the action forward. However, some transitions feel rushed, particularly the ghost's appearance and resolution, which happens too quickly to build proper tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric elements are the story's strongest feature. The neon-lit abandoned music hall, secret club with mysterious patrons, and the digital ghost create a compelling noir-meets-supernatural setting. Sensory details like the "crackle of old vinyl" voice and the ghost "flickering like a buffering video" effectively blend the digital and physical worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively creates intrigue through its digital ghost concept and the receipt-as-code device. The writing shows craft in its imagery and atmosphere. However, the emotional stakes remain unclear, and the resolution happens too quickly to deliver a truly satisfying payoff. The theme of following clues left by the dead has potential but needs more space to develop fully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, certain elements feel formulaic. The digital ghost concept is interesting but underdeveloped. Some descriptions ("quietly loud," "familiar strangers") read as contradictory phrases that sound poetic but lack concrete meaning in context. The narrative relies on telling rather than showing in key moments, particularly regarding Mara's emotional state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The digital exorcism concept offers a fresh take on ghost stories. However, the brevity constrains full development of character motivations and thematic depth. The story shows promise but would benefit from more space to explore its unique concepts and allow for more nuanced character development.</comment>
