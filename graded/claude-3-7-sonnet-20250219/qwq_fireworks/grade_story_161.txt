<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's vigilance is well-established and consistently drives her actions. Her motivation—solving her sister's death—is clear and compelling. However, her character lacks nuance; she shifts too quickly from methodical investigator to confrontational accuser without sufficient development. Her "sardonic glee" feels somewhat forced rather than emerging organically from established personality traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot connects the peacock seal to aerodynamic patterns in a clever way, but relies too heavily on convenient revelations. The confrontation with the director feels rushed and implausible—his immediate confession strains credibility. While the story achieves a complete arc, the resolution comes too easily, with Clara's deductions making logical leaps that aren't fully supported by the narrative's established clues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a distinctive atmosphere that effectively contrasts technical precision with hidden secrets. The connection between the peacock patterns, aerodynamics, and hidden graves is inventive. However, the sensory details are inconsistent—strong with the "facility's hum" but missing when describing crucial elements like the orchard or the graves, which diminishes immersion at key moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock imagery as both literal object and metaphor ("hiding in plain sight"), creating layers of meaning. The central conflict is clear and the theme of uncovering buried truths resonates. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing Clara's deductive process, and the director's confrontation lacks the tension it deserves, diminishing the emotional payoff of the revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in connecting aerodynamics to cryptic clues, but suffers from several AI-like qualities: overly neat connections, convenient revelations, and dialogue that serves exposition rather than character. The director's immediate capitulation feels algorithmic rather than human. The prose occasionally becomes purple ("her laugh was a blade") and relies on stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones. The ending, with its heavy-handed symbolism about planting trees, lacks subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements naturally, particularly the peacock patterns and vigilant character. However, it struggles with pacing—spending too much time on setup and rushing the confrontation and resolution. While the concept is intriguing, the execution lacks the nuance and psychological depth needed for top-tier literary fiction. The story shows creative thinking but doesn't fully deliver on its promising premise.</comment>
