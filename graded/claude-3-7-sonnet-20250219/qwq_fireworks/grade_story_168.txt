<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's ruthlessness is well-established and meaningfully connected to her character development. Her relationship with the comb creates emotional depth, showing how her precision masks vulnerability. However, her transformation feels slightly rushed, and we could use more insight into how her "ruthlessness" manifests in her professional life beyond the brief client reference.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Mara's controlled life to her journey of discovery, with the comb serving as an effective bridge between past and present. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints. However, the revelation about the comb's connection to the stone patterns feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stone circle setting is vividly rendered and perfectly complements the mysterious tone. The atmosphere shifts effectively from Mara's rigid precision to something more fluid and magical. Sensory details like the "monoliths slick with rain" and the humming tires create immersive texture. The timeframe within pauses between verses is brilliantly integrated into both setting and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the comb as both literal object and metaphor for Mara's relationship with control. The theme of finding meaning in spaces between structure is elegantly woven throughout. While the emotional payoff works, the revelation about the stones' meaning could benefit from more subtle foreshadowing rather than direct explanation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and specific imagery. However, certain phrases like "art's a conversation, not a verdict" feel somewhat formulaic. The character transformation follows a predictable arc, and some metaphors ("open wounds," "world softer at the edges") lack the freshness that would elevate this to truly original writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The comb as connector between Mara's past and present is particularly effective. While the writing shows craft and care, the revelation and character transformation follow somewhat predictable patterns that prevent it from achieving the highest level of literary distinction.</comment>
