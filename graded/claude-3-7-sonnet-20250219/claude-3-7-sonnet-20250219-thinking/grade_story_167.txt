<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lin Mae's character as a dutiful scholar is well-established, with clear motivation to reveal censored historical truths. Her internal conflict between academic duty and moral obligation creates compelling tension. However, her personality lacks distinctive quirks or complexities that would make her truly memorable, and her voice remains somewhat generic. The character's emotional journey is more told than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from setup to climactic action with Lin's decision to broadcast the forbidden recording. The causal relationship between discovering the erased testimony and her act of rebellion is logical and compelling. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, though the stakes could be more specifically defined beyond the vague "Time Authority" consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting brilliantly complements the time travel concept, creating a liminal space that enhances the themes of isolation and connection across time. The atmosphere of hushed anticipation before the test creates effective tension. Sensory details like the "stillness" of the hotel and Lin's reflection in the mirror ground the fantastical elements in tangible reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of historical truth, institutional censorship, and personal sacrifice. The metaphor of "contaminating" the official narrative with truth creates powerful subtext. The ending achieves emotional resonance through Lin's acceptance of consequences. However, the nature of the "forbidden tale" remains frustratingly vague, limiting the story's intellectual impact and emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the time travel premise is handled with originality, certain phrases ("heaviness of responsibility and lightness of liberation") feel formulaic. The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The concept of broadcasting erased history through time travelers is genuinely inventive, but the execution sometimes defaults to expected sci-fi tropes about institutional control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The time travel concept serves the exploration of historical truth rather than merely providing a flashy backdrop. The brevity works well for this focused moment of decision, though it limits exploration of the broader world. The lingering question of what happens after the broadcast creates meaningful resonance beyond the final line.</comment>
