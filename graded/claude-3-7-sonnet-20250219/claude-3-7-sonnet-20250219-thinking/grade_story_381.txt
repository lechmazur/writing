<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The necromancer Lena is well-developed within the constraints, with a clear motivation and distinct approach to her work. Her reverence for the past while using futuristic technology creates an interesting tension. However, we don't see much character growth or internal conflict that would elevate her beyond her function in the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively follows Lena's mapping mission with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The use of "dominate" through shared movie references creates a unique conflict resolution mechanism. However, the story lacks significant tension or obstacles beyond the "stubborn spirit," making the stakes feel somewhat low despite the interesting premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered with prismatic walls, phosphorescent chambers, and stalactites. The futuristic technology contrasts beautifully with ancient formations and ghostly presences, creating a rich atmosphere that enhances the thematic tension between past and present. The sensory details effectively immerse the reader in this unique environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of memory preservation, honoring the past, and bridging divides between life and death. The metaphor of cinema as universal language works well. However, the narrative lacks significant emotional depth or complexity in its conflict, relying more on concept than on dramatic tension to drive reader engagement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept of futuristic necromancy is inventive, the execution occasionally relies on predictable phrasing and somewhat generic emotional beats. The writing sometimes becomes overly ornate ("caps of stalactites hung like frozen memories"). The story's emotional resonance comes more from explicitly stated sentiments than from nuanced character reactions or subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with an interesting premise. The reimagining of necromancy in a sci-fi context is creative, and the thematic exploration of honoring the past while advancing knowledge is thoughtful. However, it lacks the emotional depth, narrative tension, and stylistic distinction needed for truly prestigious publication.</comment>
