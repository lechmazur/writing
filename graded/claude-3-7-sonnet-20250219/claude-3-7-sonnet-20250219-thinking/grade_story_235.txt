<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The characters of Miyako and Takeda are well-developed through their unspoken connection and shared symbolic language. Their motivations are clear and consistent, driven by a long-standing pact and separation. However, we lack deeper insight into their individual personalities beyond their shared communication system, and their voices remain somewhat distant, which prevents a perfect score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly weaves the repositioning of flowers as a central action that drives the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from established pattern to anticipated resolution. The cause-effect relationship between meteor patterns, flower positioning, and their communication is logically consistent. The pacing effectively builds toward the winter promise, though the exact stakes of their eventual conversation remain somewhat undefined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Japanese castle as an arts academy creates a richly atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the story's themes of tradition, artistry, and hidden meanings. The sensory details—moonlit gardens, meteor showers, pagoda roofs, and delicate pressed flowers—create an immersive world where the characters' subtle communication feels natural. The seasonal progression adds temporal depth that enhances the emotional resonance of their patient waiting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through its layered symbolism—flowers, celestial patterns, and artistic arrangements all serve as metaphors for unspoken emotion. The central tension of their separated-yet-connected relationship creates compelling subtext. The story effectively shows rather than tells their relationship through concrete actions (repositioning flowers, arranging scrollwork). The theme of patience and preservation resonates powerfully, though the dialogue is minimal and the emotional payoff remains promised rather than delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unique communication system and the integration of Japanese artistic traditions with personal history. The prose avoids clichés and creates fresh metaphors connecting pressed flowers to preserved emotions. However, some descriptions become slightly ornate ("delicately reposition certain flowers"), and the characters occasionally feel more like vehicles for the concept than fully realized individuals with human complexities and contradictions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, integrating them naturally into a unified narrative. The elements serve the emotional core rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, mirroring the characters' economy of expression. The lingering promise of their eventual conversation creates emotional resonance beyond the page. Minor weaknesses in character individuation and some slightly ornate phrasing prevent a higher score.</comment>
