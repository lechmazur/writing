<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Father Thomas is effectively characterized through his trembling hands, exorcist background, and methodical approach. His motivation to bridge science and faith is clear and consistent. The contrast between his outward clerical appearance and inward social analysis creates depth. However, his character could benefit from more specific personal history or emotional complexity beyond his mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and well-executed, with the puzzles creating natural progression toward the climactic revelation. The narrative flows logically from the mysterious postcard to the final discovery, with each puzzle advancing both plot and theme. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, though the transition from antagonistic tension to collaborative revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility provides an excellent backdrop for the tension between science and faith. The dance lessons create an unexpected yet effective cover for the investigation, adding layers of movement and rhythm that mirror the story's themes. Sensory details like the "spectral light" and researchers with electrodes create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the supernatural elements without overwhelming them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension through the puzzle-solving sequence and delivers a satisfying payoff with the revelation of measurable consciousness after death. The dialogue is purposeful, particularly the final exchange that crystallizes the theme. The central conflict between scientific empiricism and spiritual understanding is well-developed. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding Thomas's emotional state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its approach to the science-faith intersection and avoids most common paranormal investigation tropes. The dialogue feels natural and the emotional progression is believable. However, some phrasing ("silken blend of invitation and warning") verges on purple prose, and certain elements (the hidden room reveal, the scientist with ulterior motives) follow predictable patterns in supernatural fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The vintage postcard, puzzles, and dance lessons work together naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity serves the mysterious atmosphere well, leaving readers with intriguing questions about the implications of scientifically documented afterlife. The writing balances technical and spiritual language effectively, though occasional overwriting slightly diminishes impact.</comment>
