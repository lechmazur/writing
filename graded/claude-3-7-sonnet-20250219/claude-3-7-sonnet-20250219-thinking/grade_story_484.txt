<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Malcolm's character is well-established through his dual identity as brewer and protester, with his brewing background cleverly informing his approach to revolution. His motivation becomes increasingly clear as the story progresses. However, his emotional reactions lack some depth, and his "characteristic flippant solemnity" feels more told than shown through his limited dialogue and actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from discovery to revelation, with the mirror shard and staircase effectively driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, connecting Malcolm's protest values with his brewing skills in a meaningful way. The pacing works well, though the transition from graveyard to mansion interior feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard creates a richly atmospheric backdrop that enhances the themes of transformation and hidden knowledge. Sensory details like dust motes, the scent of old yeast, and the mechanical groan of the staircase effectively immerse the reader. The contrast between the external protest and Malcolm's internal revolution is particularly well-rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (fractured mirror reflecting Malcolm's divided life) and creates thematic resonance between brewing beer and brewing revolution. The ending delivers a satisfying philosophical punch about personal transformation as a means of changing the world. However, the conflict remains somewhat abstract, and some metaphors (darkness as "spilled ink") feel slightly conventional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI pitfalls, certain phrases ("characteristic flippant solemnity") feel unnecessarily complex. The brewing/revolution parallel is clever but occasionally heavy-handed. Some descriptions rely on familiar imagery ("darkness pooling like spilled ink"). The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive style that would elevate it to exceptional originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with philosophical undertones. Malcolm's discovery of ancient brewing techniques as a means of revolution creates a compelling central metaphor. While the writing is generally strong, it occasionally sacrifices subtlety for explicit thematic statements. The ending effectively leaves readers with the intriguing concept of revolution through personal transformation.</comment>
