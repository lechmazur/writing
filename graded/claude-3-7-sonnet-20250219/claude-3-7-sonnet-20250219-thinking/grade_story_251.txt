<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Merina's character as an ambivalent prophet is well-developed through her conflicted relationship with her gift. Her motivation to sacrifice herself for the colony emerges organically from her character. The "bashful" yet "arrogant" duality is effectively portrayed in her decision-making. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into her pre-story history to understand why she feels both "reverence and disdain" for her abilities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably tight, with the defragmentation of marbles driving the narrative forward logically. The story achieves a complete arc within the constraints, moving from problem (fractured visions) to solution (puzzle pieces) to sacrifice (trading her life). The pacing effectively builds tension through the discovery, restoration, and final decision, with cause-and-effect relationships clearly established throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is exceptionally well-integrated, with details like "recycled air," "regolith," and "helium-3" creating authentic atmosphere without overwhelming. The contrast between the sterile, artificial environment and Merina's mystical abilities creates compelling tension. The sensory details are precise and evocative, particularly the visual imagery of the marbles "swirled with blues reminiscent of Earth's vanishing oceans."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of sacrifice and fate. The central metaphor of the marbles as cosmic conduits works brilliantly, and the subtext about responsibility and choice adds depth. The ending delivers a poignant resolution that resonates beyond the narrative. The "happily sad" emotional complexity is effectively shown rather than told, particularly in Merina's final days.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of defragmenting prophecies through puzzle pieces. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and authentic emotional nuance. However, the "cosmic scoreboard" metaphor feels slightly overused, and some descriptions ("her heart skipping with possibilities") edge toward familiar phrasing. The narrative voice occasionally slips into slightly generic mystical language that could be more distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity serves the narrative well, creating a focused meditation on fate and sacrifice. The lingering image of glowing marbles arranged as a constellation above Merina's grave provides a resonant final note that extends the story's emotional impact beyond its conclusion. The story demonstrates sophisticated thematic depth within tight constraints.</comment>
