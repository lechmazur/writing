<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Professor Wei's character development is strong, showing a clear arc from emotionless rationality to awakening curiosity. Her scientific mindset provides consistent motivation throughout, and her internal conflict between programmed loyalty and scientific integrity feels authentic. However, her transformation happens somewhat quickly given the constraints of emotional elimination, and we could benefit from more insight into her specific emotional awakening beyond intellectual curiosity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from discovery to hypothesis to action with clear causality. The cultivation of snowflakes drives the narrative forward logically, creating a compelling arc from Wei's initial discovery to her world-changing decision. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the beginning (finding the veil) connecting meaningfully to the end (broadcasting findings). The pacing effectively balances scientific discovery with philosophical realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes creates a powerful isolation that mirrors the emotional barrenness of society. The juxtaposition of frozen landscape with living apple trees subtly reinforces the theme. Sensory details like breath clouds, frost-covered soil, and crystal shadows create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the scientific-yet-poetic tone. The setting brilliantly serves as both literal environment and metaphorical landscape for the story's emotional awakening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its elegant parallel between snowflake geometry and human emotions, suggesting order within apparent chaos. The central metaphor of patterns connecting stars, snowflakes, and human feelings creates a cohesive philosophical framework. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution that feels earned. The narrative effectively "shows" Wei's transformation through her changing focus from stars to snowflakes rather than explicitly stating her emotional development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, particularly in connecting scientific observation with emotional awakening. The snowflake metaphor feels fresh rather than clich√©d. However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward overly formal academic language ("cerebral patterns," "evolutionary flaws") that slightly diminishes authenticity. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout but could benefit from more specific, unique details about Wei's personal experience to further distinguish it from similar sci-fi narratives about emotional reclamation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The scientific framework provides a strong foundation for exploring emotional themes, creating meaningful tension between rationality and humanity. The brevity works as a strength, allowing the story to maintain focus on its central philosophical question without unnecessary tangents. The lingering image of melting snowflakes as society awakens provides a resonant conclusion that extends beyond the narrative itself.</comment>
