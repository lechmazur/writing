<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's character is well-developed through her candy sculpting resistance work. Her motivation—reclaiming her forgotten homeland—drives her actions consistently. The vendetta feels authentic and evolves meaningfully when she discovers personal connection to Lyria. However, her emotional journey could be more nuanced beyond the steady "rage" and "fury" that define her early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from Margot's initial resistance through the photograph revelations to the final discovery. The counterattack using candy as information carriers creates excellent tension. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships. The revelation about Lyria being Margot's homeland provides a satisfying twist that recontextualizes her earlier actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting perfectly complements the theme of erased history. Sensory details of Margot's crystalline sculptures create vivid imagery that serves both plot and atmosphere. The contrast between beautiful candy and dangerous secrets creates compelling tension. The world-building efficiently establishes a repressive regime without excessive exposition, allowing the setting to naturally enhance the rebellion narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses candy-making as metaphor for memory preservation and resistance. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the revelation of personal connection to the forgotten homeland. The theme of memory as resistance is powerfully conveyed. While dialogue is minimal, Margot's few spoken lines carry significant weight. The ending provides both plot resolution and thematic resonance about collective memory and identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of coded candy messages. However, some phrasing feels slightly formulaic ("carved with the precision of a surgeon," "trembling fingers"). The emotional progression is generally authentic, though occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout. The concept of memory erasure as political control isn't entirely novel, but the candy-sculpture resistance method provides a fresh approach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each serves the central themes of memory, resistance, and identity. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining. The creative combination of candy-making with espionage creates a distinctive narrative voice. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about collective memory and subtle resistance that transcend the specific plot.</comment>
