<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jericho Kane's character as an outlaw cowboy poet is well-established and his ambivalence toward his cosmic responsibility is convincingly portrayed. His distinct voice comes through in dialogue ("Destinies ain't meant to be read like trail signs"). However, his backstory remains somewhat underdeveloped, and the transition from hiding outlaw to cosmic adjuster feels slightly rushed given the word constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively builds from mysterious messages to a climactic revelation and action. The narrative arc is complete with Jericho recognizing his purpose and taking decisive action to "misalign" the stars. The cause-effect relationship between the wall messages, Professor Shaw's research, and Jericho's intervention is logically constructed, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory setting is richly realized with mechanical details (brass table, gears, calibration console) that enhance the atmosphere. The juxtaposition of cowboy elements with futuristic technology creates a distinctive world. Sensory details like the whirring gears and the visual impact of constellations shifting effectively immerse the reader in this unique environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of order versus chaos, destiny versus free will, and the beauty of cosmic randomness. The central conflict between imposed order and natural chaos provides meaningful tension. Literary devices like the changing wall text serve as effective metaphors. The ending delivers both resolution and philosophical resonance, though some emotional beats could be more deeply developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its genre-blending approach and the creative use of the steampunk observatory setting. The prose avoids excessive ornamentation while maintaining distinctive style. However, some phrases like "saturated ambivalence" feel slightly self-conscious, and the character's transformation follows a somewhat predictable hero's journey pattern. The cosmic messaging device, while interesting, borders on convenient plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole with thematic purpose. The blend of Western, steampunk, and cosmic elements creates a distinctive narrative voice. The brevity works in service of the story rather than limiting it, though some transitions between scenes feel compressed. The philosophical conclusion leaves readers with meaningful questions about order, chaos, and human intervention in larger systems.</comment>
