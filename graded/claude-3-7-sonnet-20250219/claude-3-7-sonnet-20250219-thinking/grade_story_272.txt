<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness is consistently portrayed through his avoidance of eye contact and trembling fingers. His inventor identity drives the plot naturally. However, his character could be deepened beyond these surface traits—his internal conflict about his past betrayal is told rather than shown through meaningful action or dialogue. The whistle connection to his grandfather adds dimension, but his emotional journey feels somewhat underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "reap" action metaphorically as Marcus harvests the consequences of his past work. The reversed trails method is cleverly integrated with the whistle's function. The story achieves a satisfying arc from problem to resolution within the word limit, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The ending provides closure while opening possibilities. The only weakness is that the stakes and specific nature of his "weaponized" creation remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The late-night diner setting creates an effective contrast—mundane surroundings hiding extraordinary technology. Sensory details like buzzing fluorescent lights and rumbling coffee pot ground the fantastical elements. The encrypted archive's placement beneath everyday customers creates tension. The atmosphere of secrecy and midnight operations perfectly complements the forgotten arts concept and Marcus's clandestine mission. The world-building efficiently establishes both the physical and technological landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the whistle as both literal tool and metaphor for inheritance and redemption. The grandfather's quotes provide thematic bookends about moving backward to go forward. The conflict between Marcus's past mistake and present redemption creates meaningful tension. The unexpected connection with Delia adds depth. However, the emotional impact could be stronger with more showing of Marcus's internal struggle rather than stating his feelings of regret.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but contains some overly formal phrasing ("with practiced nonchalance," "restless acceptance") that feels slightly artificial. The metaphor of "chopping down the tree of regret" is somewhat heavy-handed. While the concept of a sound-based decryption whistle is original, the corporate-weaponization plot feels familiar. The character's emotional journey follows a predictable redemption arc without surprising developments or nuanced emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with clear purpose. The whistle serves as both plot device and symbol, while the diner setting creates effective contrast with the high-tech mission. The brevity works well for this contained mission, though it limits deeper character exploration. The ending effectively balances resolution with new possibilities. The story leaves readers with the resonant idea that undoing past mistakes can create space for future growth.</comment>
