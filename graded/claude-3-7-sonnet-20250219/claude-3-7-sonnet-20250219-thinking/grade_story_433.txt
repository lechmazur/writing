<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's hardheaded nature is established early and drives his transformation convincingly. His motivation to escape digital fame while finding himself trapped physically and emotionally creates compelling tension. However, the character lacks distinctive dialogue or unique voice that would elevate him beyond an archetype of the disconnected influencer. His internal struggle is told more than shown in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the blizzard as both literal and metaphorical entrapment, creating a coherent journey from resistance to acceptance. The prophecy fragments provide a clear mechanism for the character's transformation. The narrative arc is complete and satisfying, with the resolution showing meaningful change. The pacing effectively balances exposition and revelation within the constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery in a former library creates a richly symbolic setting that mirrors the protagonist's journey. The contrast between permanent books and temporary ice art reinforces the theme of impermanence versus lasting value. The snowy isolation effectively creates both physical confinement and space for introspection. Sensory details of moonlight, snow, and dusty shelves create a vivid, immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the theme of connection versus influence through both plot and symbolism. The ephemeral art gallery serves as a powerful metaphor for the transient nature of online fame. The ending provides satisfying resolution while suggesting ongoing growth. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some metaphors (like "hands trembled") feel somewhat conventional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI hallmarks, certain phrases ("demure audacity," "wholeheartedly broken") feel slightly forced. The narrative occasionally slips into telling emotional states directly rather than revealing them through action. The prophecy device, while effective, follows a somewhat predictable pattern of revelation. The story's central metaphor is strong but not entirely original in its execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The transformation of the protagonist feels earned rather than contrived. The prose is generally clear and purposeful, avoiding excessive ornamentation. The ending provides meaningful resolution while suggesting continued growth. However, certain emotional beats could be more subtly rendered, and some metaphorical language lacks freshness.</comment>
