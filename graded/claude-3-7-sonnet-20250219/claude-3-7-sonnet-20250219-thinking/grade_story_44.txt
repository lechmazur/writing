<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's character is well-developed through her background as a stablehand and her current role as a sculptor. Her motivation to preserve ancient techniques is clear and consistent. Her feisty insistence on traditional methods effectively shapes her actions and reputation. The character possesses a distinct personality that drives the narrative, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively integrates the morphing action as a central element that drives the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, moving from Mira's transit with the lamp to her transformation of space debris into art and finally to recognition of her work. The cause-effect relationships are logical, and the pacing balances exposition with action well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The space debris studio setting is brilliantly realized and perfectly complements the theme of transforming discarded objects into art. The juxtaposition of ancient techniques with futuristic orbital galleries creates a compelling atmosphere. Sensory details like the lamp's "soft glow" and the "high-pitched hum" effectively immerse the reader in this unique environment. The setting and objects are meaningfully connected throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of tradition versus innovation and the value of human craftsmanship in a digital age. The narrative shows rather than tells Mira's passion and skill. The lamp as a vessel for lost knowledge works as both literal plot device and metaphor. The ending leaves readers with a sense of ongoing purpose that resonates beyond the immediate narrative. The conflict between automated perfection and human imperfection is subtly but effectively conveyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of preserving ancient crafting techniques through space-age art. The writing avoids most AI-typical patterns, with fresh metaphors like debris flowing "like mercury." However, some phrasing feels slightly formulaic, and certain emotional beats could be more nuanced. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, though some transitions between ideas could be smoother.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, offering just enough detail to immerse readers while maintaining momentum. The concept of bridging past craftsmanship with future art provides intellectual and emotional resonance. The narrative leaves readers with meaningful questions about the value of human touch in an increasingly automated world.</comment>
