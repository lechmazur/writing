<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra's introversion and empathic abilities are well-integrated into her character, driving her isolation from the pirates and her mission to help outcasts. Her motivation is clear and consistent. However, her emotional depth could be further developed beyond her functional role in the resistance network. We get glimpses of her connection to her grandmother and understanding of being "broken," but these insights remain somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word constraint, with Lyra completing her task of reassembling the marionette to activate the beacon. The cause-effect relationships are logical, and the "marshaling" action drives the plot forward. However, the story relies heavily on exposition rather than showing the action unfold, particularly regarding the underground railroad operation. The pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing the scope of Lyra's resistance network.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The space pirate hideout setting is vividly rendered with specific details like the "curved walls embracing her like ancient stone guardians" and the tight passageway. The asteroid setting meaningfully connects to the "mountain wisdom" concept. The atmosphere effectively contrasts Lyra's quiet sanctuary with the boisterous pirates, creating tension. The sensory details of her physical environment are particularly strong, though emotional atmosphere could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the marionette representing outcasts, the starfish as possibilities) and creates a compelling theme about invisible resistance and valuing neurodiversity. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting ongoing action. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows ("her empathic abilities picking up distant emotions") and some potentially powerful moments are stated rather than dramatized, diminishing emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, there are moments of slightly generic description and telling rather than showing. The metaphors are generally fresh ("asteroid's curved walls embracing her like ancient stone guardians"), but some phrasing feels formulaic ("her fingers worked"). The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally relies on stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones. The concept of an empath running a resistance network is original, though the execution sometimes defaults to expected sci-fi tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear theme about championing neurodiversity and resistance. The space setting and character's abilities work well together, creating a unique premise. However, the brief length sometimes results in telling rather than showing key aspects of the world and Lyra's operations. The story leaves readers with intriguing questions about this resistance network, though some elements feel more functional to the plot than organically developed.</comment>
