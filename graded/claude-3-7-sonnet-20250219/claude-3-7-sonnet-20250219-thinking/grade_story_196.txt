<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Karev's character development is strong, with his "fiercely apathetic" facade convincingly portrayed as both shield and prison. His internal conflict between resignation and defiance feels authentic, and his relationship with his younger self creates meaningful tension. However, we could benefit from more specific details about what initially drove him to the monastery or what specifically about Tomas's departure catalyzes his change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses Tomas's resignation as the inciting incident that awakens Karev's dormant desire to leave. The meteor shower provides both symbolic resonance and practical direction. The arc from resignation to resolve is clear, though the middle section could be tightened to create more momentum toward his decision point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery creates an immediate sense of isolation that perfectly mirrors Karev's emotional state. The contrast between institutional fear of meteors and Karev's secret fascination with them adds depth. The breakroom setting works exceptionally well as a liminal space where transformation can occur, though more sensory details of the monastery itself would strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the meteor shower as both literal guide and metaphor for breaking free. The parallel between Tomas's resignation letter and Karev's own internal resignation creates meaningful subtext. The ending achieves poignancy through the reframing of Karev's final "battle" as an internal one. However, the theme of institutional control versus personal freedom could be developed with more specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls, certain phrases like "knowing naivety" and "comfortable numbness of surrender" feel slightly formulaic. The character's emotional journey is generally well-rendered, but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. The monastery setting, while interesting, employs some familiar tropes of isolated religious orders without fully subverting them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The floating monastery and meteor shower create a distinctive backdrop for Karev's internal struggle. The piece achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, though it occasionally sacrifices specificity for broader thematic statements. The ending effectively balances resolution with forward momentum.</comment>
