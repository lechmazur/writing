<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Professor Elara Lin is well-established as a daydreaming scholar whose unorthodox methods drive her discoveries. Her motivation to create a mathematical masterpiece that connects humanity is clear and consistent. However, her emotional journey lacks sufficient depthâ€”we see her determination but get limited insight into her struggles, doubts, or personal transformation through her work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Elara's initial discovery to the widespread impact of her equations centuries later. The narrative effectively connects the satellite fragment to her mathematical breakthrough and humanity's salvation. The progression from personal obsession to world-changing discovery feels organic, though the transition from scientific skepticism to widespread acceptance happens somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-glacial flooded world with its submerged palace and mysteriously preserved skating rink creates a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. The cursed waters that amplify emotion perfectly complement the story's theme of mathematical compassion. The setting isn't merely backdrop but integral to the plot, with the palace's preservation and the lake's properties directly enabling Elara's breakthrough.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the intersection of science and emotion, suggesting that mathematical truth can foster human connection. The image of equations carved into ice through skating creates powerful symbolism. While the narrative successfully builds to a meaningful conclusion that resonates beyond its ending, some emotional beats feel stated rather than fully developed, and the scientific concepts, while intriguing, remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story presents an original premise combining mathematics, climate change, and emotional resonance. However, certain elements feel overly convenient (the perfectly preserved skating rink, the immediate acceptance of Elara's theories). The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional impact ("profound empathy," "emotionally transformative"). The final paragraphs shift into a more summarized, distant perspective that diminishes immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The concept of mathematical equations that inspire compassion offers a thought-provoking premise. While the writing demonstrates creativity in combining scientific and emotional elements, the narrative occasionally sacrifices intimate character moments for broader conceptual exploration. The ending effectively extends the story's impact beyond its immediate timeframe.</comment>
