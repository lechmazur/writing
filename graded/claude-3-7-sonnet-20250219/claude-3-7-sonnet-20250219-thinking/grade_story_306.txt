<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's character is well-developed through her history as a child star who was always intellectually curious and socially awkward. Her motivation to discover the "frequency of madness" aligns perfectly with her established oddness and academic interests. The financial betrayal by her parents provides a compelling reason for her desperate pursuit. Her distinct voice comes through in phrases like "Come on, you beautiful bastard," revealing her irreverent personality. However, the transition from sitcom star to quantum physicist feels slightly underdeveloped within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from discovery of the map to experimentation to transcendence/madness. The cause-effect relationships are clear, with each action leading naturally to the next consequence. The story achieves a complete arc despite its brevity, moving from Maya's past through her present experiment to her transformation. The pacing effectively builds tension toward the climactic moment when the frequencies manifest. The ending provides both resolution and a haunting aftermath that ties back to her ambition, creating a satisfying circular structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber creates the perfect clinical setting that contrasts with the mystical nature of Maya's pursuit. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful—the green oscilloscope line, the harmonic resonance filling the room, and the synesthetic experience as Maya's perception changes. The atmosphere shifts effectively from scientific precision to transcendent wonder as the experiment progresses. The cathedral window connects the scientific setting with the mystical concept brilliantly, bridging medieval craftsmanship with modern physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional impact through its exploration of the thin line between genius and madness. The central conflict—Maya's willingness to sacrifice everything for discovery—resonates throughout. Literary devices are used masterfully, particularly the metaphor of light through stained glass mirroring her fracturing consciousness. The theme of ambition's double-edged nature is powerfully conveyed through both the narrative and the final image of revolutionary equations alongside impossible storyboards—a testament to both what she gained and lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise of medieval glassmakers accidentally encoding vibrational patterns that access heightened consciousness. The writing avoids clichés and purple prose, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. However, some phrases like "the wild magic of madness" appear multiple times, and the synesthetic experience during the transformation relies on somewhat familiar descriptions. The character's journey from child star to physicist could benefit from more unique details to avoid feeling like a recognizable "fallen celebrity" narrative template.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated narrative with significant emotional impact. The juxtaposition of scientific precision with mystical discovery creates a compelling tension throughout. The ending leaves readers with profound questions about the nature of genius, madness, and whether Maya's transformation was worth the cost—suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. A few transitions could be smoother, but overall the piece achieves remarkable coherence.</comment>
