<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's character as an underestimated rebel is established well through her dissatisfaction with scripted scares and desire for genuine terror. Her connection to her grandfather's knife provides emotional depth, though her transformation feels somewhat rushed. Elijah remains underdeveloped, serving primarily as a catalyst rather than a fully realized character. Maya's motivation is clear but could benefit from more nuanced exploration of why she's been "sleepwalking through existence."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from Maya's dissatisfaction to opportunity (midnight call) to collaboration to event execution to bittersweet parting. The structure effectively incorporates the assigned elements without feeling forced. However, the transition from haunted house employee to supper club creator happens too smoothly, lacking realistic obstacles. The ending achieves poignancy but feels somewhat predictable in its ephemeral connection trope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is utilized exceptionally well, creating a perfect backdrop for both horror and unexpected romance. Sensory details like "artificial fog," "cobwebbed windows," and "fake gravestones" effectively establish atmosphere. The contrast between scripted horror and genuine connection creates thematic resonance. The amusement park lights dimming at the end provides a powerful visual metaphor for the story's ephemeral nature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of adaptation, connection, and finding meaning in unexpected places. The pocket knife serves as a strong symbolic element, with its multiple blades representing life lessons. The ending achieves emotional impact through its bittersweet quality. However, the story occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some metaphors ("heart as still and stagnant") feel somewhat conventional rather than fresh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases ("midnight velvet," "sadly joyful smile") feel somewhat generic. The narrative follows a relatively predictable arc of unexpected connection and bittersweet parting. The Ethiopian cuisine element feels somewhat arbitrarily chosen rather than essential to the characters. The story's emotional beats are genuine but occasionally rely on stated feelings rather than demonstrated ones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates multiple assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The haunted house setting and pocket knife object are particularly well utilized. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a snapshot of connection that mirrors its ephemeral theme. While not groundbreaking in its approach, the story achieves a satisfying emotional arc and leaves the reader with a lingering sense of bittersweet possibility.</comment>
