<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morgan Thale is well-developed as a soul broker with a distinct methodology and motivation. Her character is consistently portrayed through her professional demeanor and specialized skill set. The character's motivation to learn forgotten songs is elegantly woven into her actions. However, we could benefit from more emotional depth or personal stakes to elevate her beyond her professional role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc of a soul-brokering transaction from introduction to completion. The choreographed reading of reversed labels drives the narrative forward with purpose. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the accountant-spirit's journey providing a satisfying resolution. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating tea platform in the Veil Mists creates an immediately immersive otherworldly setting. The "weirdly static" time perfectly complements the liminal space between lives. Sensory details like crystallizing music notes and the tilting platform in response to the melody create a vivid, multidimensional atmosphere that enhances the ethereal nature of soul brokering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and imagery, particularly in the visualization of souls as real estate prospects and music as a cosmic force. The central theme of finding one's true path resonates emotionally. The ending provides both closure for the current transaction and hints at a larger cosmic significance. The narrative effectively shows rather than tells, allowing the reader to experience the soul transition through sensory details.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story presents a fresh take on afterlife mythology with its real estate metaphor. The prose avoids clich√©s and creates unique imagery like "notes crystallizing in the air like delicate ice formations." While occasionally verging on purple prose, the language generally serves the ethereal setting. The narrative maintains consistent tone and style throughout, with metaphors that feel specific to this world rather than generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, offering a glimpse into a fascinating cosmic system without overexplaining. The concept of soul brokering through forgotten songs creates lingering questions about the universe's structure and Morgan's place within it. The story achieves depth through implication rather than explicit statement.</comment>
