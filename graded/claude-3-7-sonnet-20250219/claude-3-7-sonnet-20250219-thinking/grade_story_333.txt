<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as a sincere rebel is well-established through her opposition to the university's demolition plans and her family history of defending the building. Her motivation to document and preserve architectural traditions is clear and consistent. However, her emotional development feels somewhat rushed within the constraints, and her dialogue occasionally serves exposition rather than revealing character depth. Her transformation from trembling fear to confident determination could benefit from more nuanced progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses Maya's theorizing to drive the narrative forward, with a clear beginning (entering the passage), middle (confronting fears and sharing secrets), and resolution (discovering hidden plans). The timeframe between storms creates natural tension and urgency. However, the passage's response to Maya's secrets feels slightly too convenient, and the resolution comes without sufficient complication or resistance, making the plot arc somewhat predictable despite the atmospheric strengths.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage is vividly rendered with exceptional sensory details—damp stones, dancing shadows, walls that seem to breathe. The atmosphere of preservation rather than malevolence is a compelling twist on haunted settings. The timeframe between storms enhances tension while providing logical constraints. The physical environment actively responds to the protagonist in a way that feels organic to the established supernatural elements, creating a setting that functions almost as another character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the building as a metaphor for threatened knowledge and tradition, with Maya's personal connection creating emotional stakes. The central conflict between preservation and progress is well-established. However, the resolution feels too neat—the passage simply revealing what she seeks without sufficient struggle undermines potential tension. While the writing shows craft in its atmospheric elements, the theme of rebellion through preservation could be explored with more complexity and nuance rather than positioning the university board as one-dimensional antagonists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids many AI hallmarks through its consistent tone and specific architectural details. The concept of a building that responds to shared secrets is original. However, some descriptions ("walls seemed to breathe," "cold dread climbing her spine") rely on familiar phrasing, and the university board's characterization as simply valuing "property values over heritage" lacks nuance. The passage's supernatural responses follow a predictable pattern that diminishes surprise. The emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical rather than organic, particularly in how quickly Maya overcomes her fear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about architectural preservation and rebellion. The haunted passage, torn sticky note, and timeframe between storms work particularly well together. The writing demonstrates thoughtful craft in its atmospheric elements and thematic coherence. However, the story's impact is somewhat diminished by its predictable resolution and the somewhat simplified characterization of the conflict. While it creates a compelling mood and setting, it doesn't fully capitalize on the potential complexity of its premise.</comment>
