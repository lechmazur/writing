<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is effectively established and consistent throughout. His methodical approach to supernatural phenomena reveals a pragmatic character who adapts to extraordinary circumstances. The relationship with Captain Merrill's ghost shows depth, though we could benefit from more insight into what drives the sentinel beyond survival. His voice is distinct in both narration and dialogue, particularly in his matter-of-fact negotiations with the dead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the crossing off of the final name to the sentinel's unconventional methods of lighthouse keeping. The confiscation of the logbook drives meaningful conflict and negotiation. The waltz serves as both resolution and bridge to future interactions, creating a satisfying arc despite the brevity. The cause-effect relationship between the dance and the ghost's cooperation is particularly well-executed, with the ending promising further development while still feeling complete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered with specific, evocative details—the creaking floorboards, the temperature drop, the beam cutting through fog. The bedroom with its wall of crossed-off names creates immediate atmosphere. The juxtaposition of bureaucratic regulations against supernatural reality enhances tension. Sensory elements like the phonograph's crackle and the ghost's voice "like waves scraping against rocky shore" create immersive, haunting ambiance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its portrayal of an unlikely alliance between the living and dead. The waltz serves as a powerful metaphor for the delicate balance between order and chaos. The crossed-off names create haunting subtext about responsibility and failure. The dialogue is sparse but purposeful, revealing character and advancing plot simultaneously. The central conflict—survival through supernatural knowledge—is compelling, with the dance negotiation providing a unique resolution that invites deeper reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the ghost-lighthouse keeper premise isn't entirely original, the execution avoids predictable haunting tropes through the unexpected dance negotiation. The relationship between sentinel and ghost shows nuanced complexity rather than simple antagonism. Some phrases like "reckless precision" feel slightly manufactured. The story demonstrates creative thinking in how the supernatural is treated matter-of-factly rather than with typical horror elements, though the frayed rope mystery feels somewhat like a standard ghost story device.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced—particularly the waltz as negotiation tool and the crossed-off names as worldbuilding. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a snapshot of an ongoing relationship rather than a limitation. The enigmatic ending regarding the rope creates lingering questions that suggest depth beyond the explicit narrative. The blend of bureaucratic lighthouse keeping with supernatural elements demonstrates creative thinking in worldbuilding.</comment>
