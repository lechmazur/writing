<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliot's character is well-developed through his insomnia and poetic sensibilities. His transformation from collector to respectful listener shows meaningful growth. However, his initial motivations remain somewhat vague, and his shift in perspective, while thematically strong, could benefit from more psychological nuance rather than relatively quick acceptance of the supernatural.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from discovery to resolution with a clear arc. The connection between botanical samples and indigenous heritage creates meaningful tension. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and idealized, with Eliot's fourteen-night research period glossed over rather than dramatized, missing opportunities to show his struggle with this revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is exceptionally well-utilized, with the "meticulously messy" space reflecting Eliot's mental state. The subway stops create an effective liminal space for supernatural communication. The atmosphere successfully balances academic detachment with spiritual unease, though more sensory details of the plants themselves would strengthen the connection to the botanical theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of cultural appropriation, restitution, and humility with subtlety. The metaphor of botanical collection as colonial acquisition is powerful. The ending achieves emotional resonance through Eliot's transformation. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the whispers' teachings and Eliot's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally relies on predictable narrative beats. The indigenous burial ground revelation is somewhat tropey, and the resolution follows a familiar pattern of white enlightenment. The language is generally strong but occasionally veers into overly formal phrasing ("Violence created this wound," "Only its absence can heal it") that feels more like thematic statements than organic dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The botanical samples, haunted setting, and whispered warnings create a compelling framework for exploring cultural restitution. However, the story's brevity constrains full exploration of Eliot's internal conflict, and the resolution, while thematically satisfying, feels somewhat idealized rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>
