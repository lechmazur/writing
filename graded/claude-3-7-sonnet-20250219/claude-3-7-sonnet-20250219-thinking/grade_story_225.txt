<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's character as a wayward apothecary is established well through her scientific pursuits and synthesis of compounds. Her motivation to track butterflies is clear and consistent. However, the relationship with Laurent feels underdeveloped—mentioned but not demonstrated through meaningful interaction. Their "unconventional love" is told rather than shown, missing opportunities for character depth through their dynamic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from observation to discovery, with the butterfly tracking driving the narrative forward. The revelation that the butterflies are communicating in morse code creates an effective climax. However, the stakes regarding the "broken treaties" remain abstract rather than concrete, and the connection between the diplomatic situation and the butterfly research could be more explicitly developed to strengthen the plot's coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is richly realized with specific sensory details—hissing steam, creaking metal, the curved glass viewport. The underwater world contrasts effectively with the chaotic surface politics. The atmosphere of wonder and discovery amid political turmoil creates a compelling tension that enhances both the scientific pursuit and the relationship storyline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively builds to the revelation of non-human intelligence, creating a moment of genuine wonder. The metaphorical connection between the butterflies' adaptation and human diplomatic failures offers thematic depth. However, the emotional impact of the relationship between Miriam and Laurent remains underdeveloped, told rather than demonstrated through meaningful interaction, limiting the story's emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of underwater butterflies is original, some descriptions rely on familiar phrasing ("fingers gently brushed hers," "gasped in awe"). The relationship feels formulaic—introduced without nuance. The prose occasionally becomes purple ("transcendent beauty amid a world of broken promises"). However, the scientific elements and the integration of morse code communication show creative thinking that elevates the concept beyond standard fare.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The steampunk submarine setting and underwater butterflies create a distinctive world. However, the relationship aspect feels grafted on rather than integral, and some emotional beats rely on telling rather than showing. The ending achieves a sense of wonder but would benefit from tighter connection to the political backdrop established earlier.</comment>
