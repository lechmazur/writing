<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliza's character is well-established through her dual identity as baker and time-traveling resistance fighter. Her "cynically gentle" attribute manifests naturally in how townsfolk dismiss her as eccentric while she works against tyranny. However, we get limited insight into her emotional landscape or personal history that would elevate her beyond her functional role in the plot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively integrates the action of "exceeding" parameters with the time machine, creating a coherent narrative arc from problem identification to resolution. The causal relationships between moon phases, contamination, and citizen behavior are logically established. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the confrontation with Thornfield feels somewhat rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building excels in blending the mundane (bakery) with the extraordinary (time machine garage). The mystical reality tone permeates consistently through speaking shadows, lunar influences, and temporal flowers. Sensory details like "flour-dusted hands" and shadows that slide across objects create a vivid atmosphere where the magical and ordinary coexist seamlessly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of dough/rising power in the final paragraph to underscore its theme. The central conflict is clear and resolved satisfyingly. The narrative shows rather than tells Eliza's character through her actions. However, the confrontation scene lacks emotional weight, and some narrative transitions feel slightly mechanical rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story combines elements creatively, certain phrases like "cynically gentle" appear multiple times without variation. The shadow dialogue occasionally feels like a convenient plot device rather than an organic story element. The confrontation scene relies on telling ("Your reign ends tonight") rather than showing the dramatic tension. However, the integration of baking metaphors with political resistance demonstrates originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The mystical reality tone is maintained consistently, and the ending provides both resolution and a hint of future vigilance that adds depth. While some transitions could be smoother and certain elements more deeply explored, the overall execution demonstrates skilled storytelling within tight constraints.</comment>
