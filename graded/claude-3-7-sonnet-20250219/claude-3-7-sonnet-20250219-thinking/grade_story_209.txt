<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tanner Mills is exceptionally well-developed within the constraints. His woodsman identity meaningfully connects to his life's work mapping abandoned railways, while his relationship with Eleanor provides emotional depth. His motivation—revealed to be preserving memories of happiness with his wife rather than historical preservation—creates a powerful character revelation. The hairbrush serves as a poignant emotional anchor, revealing his devotion. His "artfully messy" appearance effectively contrasts with his methodical, precise work. Minor weakness: his dialogue could be more distinctive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably cohesive, with the parallel timelines of Tanner completing his mapping work while Eleanor approaches death creating effective tension. The short-circuit crisis provides a compelling complication that raises stakes. The story achieves a complete arc despite constraints, with the revelation of Tanner's true motivation providing a satisfying emotional resolution. The cause-and-effect relationships are logical, and the pacing effectively balances technical details with emotional weight. The only weakness is that the transition to Tanner's confession feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and water tower create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the technical aspects of Tanner's work. The contrast between the isolated, deteriorating industrial landscape and the sterile hospital environment effectively mirrors the emotional state of the protagonist. The dying sunlight and electromagnetic crackling create sensory richness. The setting meaningfully connects to both the method (echo measurement) and the object (the hairbrush catching light). However, the "radio wave garden" concept could be more fully developed to strengthen the world-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional impact through its parallel structure and revelation of Tanner's true motivation. The railway mapping becomes a powerful metaphor for preserving connections to loved ones. The hairbrush symbolism and the "forty-three strokes" detail add emotional resonance. The ending delivers a profound emotional payoff that elevates the entire narrative. The story effectively shows rather than tells, particularly in moments like Tanner clutching the hairbrush tighter. The theme of honesty as freedom is subtly woven throughout, culminating in a moment of genuine catharsis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its premise and execution. The technical aspects of railway mapping through radio echoes feel authentic and researched rather than generic. The emotional core avoids sentimentality through specific, earned details like the forty-three hairbrush strokes. The writing maintains consistent tone and style throughout, with fresh metaphors and specific sensory details. Character emotions are shown through actions rather than stated. The only minor weakness is occasional overreliance on adjectives in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, particularly the integration of the technical mapping method with the emotional core. The parallel structure creates tension and emotional resonance that transcends the word limit. The prose balances technical detail with emotional weight effectively. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about memory, preservation, and honesty that extend beyond the explicit narrative. Minor weaknesses in pacing and dialogue are overshadowed by the story's emotional impact and thematic depth.</comment>
