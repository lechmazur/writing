<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mortimer Ellis is well-developed through his unique occupation and mission. His obsession with crosswords as spiritual tools gives him clear motivation and a distinct personality. The character's dedication to helping lost souls through his peculiar talent creates a compelling portrait, though we could benefit from more insight into how he discovered this ability or what personal stakes drive him beyond the general desire to help.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is elegantly crafted around Mortimer's process of helping Elizabeth Chambers find peace. The narrative flows logically from introduction of character and setting through the specific case of Elizabeth to resolution. The action of creating crosswords to guide souls provides a unique framework that drives the story forward with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse as a "whisper collection point" creates an evocative, liminal setting perfectly suited to the supernatural premise. The "starless night" timeframe enhances the otherworldly atmosphere. Sensory details like whispers "proliferating through stone walls" and the jangling of keys create a vivid sensory experience that bridges the physical and spiritual realms. The setting functions as both literal space and metaphorical threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the crossword puzzle as both plot device and metaphor for unlocking spiritual mysteries. The narrative creates emotional resonance through Mortimer's compassionate mission and Elizabeth's century-old regret. Literary devices like "spiritual algebra" and the lighthouse metaphor enrich the text. The ending provides satisfying closure while maintaining a sense of ongoing mission. The theme of reconciliation through acknowledging hidden truths is consistently developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story presents an original premise with the crossword-soul connection, though some phrasing ("his peculiar gift," "something ancient and necessary") feels somewhat generic. While the concept is fresh, certain descriptions like "the weight of Elizabeth's freedom a satisfying burden" edge toward purple prose. The narrative maintains consistent tone and style throughout, avoiding major AI-typical inconsistencies, though some metaphors could be more specific to this particular story world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The crossword creator, whisper collection point, and soul-guiding mission merge into a unique supernatural premise with emotional depth. The brevity works as a strength, offering a glimpse into an intriguing world without overexplaining. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about Mortimer's past and future cases that suggest depth beyond this single narrative.</comment>
