<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's characterization through his regret over choosing duty over love is expertly conveyed. His motivation to reconcile with past choices is clear and drives the entire narrative. His emotional journey from regret to acceptance feels authentic, particularly when he touches the knocker and experiences "grudgingly sweet acceptance." The character possesses psychological depth rarely achieved in such limited space.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly traces the knight's emotional journey from regret to acceptance within a tight structure. The items forming a pattern creates an effective revelation moment. While the structure relies heavily on internal realization rather than external action, this serves the reflective nature of the story. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence, with each paragraph building logically toward the emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting masterfully symbolizes isolation and penance, while the mirrored reflection provides a liminal space for confronting the past. Sensory details like "storm-slicked lantern glass" and the "waves on the jagged reef below" create vivid atmosphere. The contrast between cold lighthouse reality and warm memory creates palpable tension. The setting doesn't merely contain the story—it embodies the character's psychological state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of sacrifice, regret, and acceptance. Rich symbolism permeates the narrative—the lighthouse as isolation, the knocker as forbidden entry, the pattern as cosmic connection. The ending provides satisfying resolution while maintaining poignancy. The metaphorical language ("a cancer in his soul," "arduous pilgrimage") elevates the prose without becoming purple. The theme of redemption through acknowledging painful truths resonates beyond the immediate story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical pitfalls, employing fresh metaphors and consistent tone. However, certain phrases ("terrible, beautiful understanding," "joyful agony") rely on contradictory pairings that feel somewhat formulaic. While generally evocative, some descriptions like "grudgingly sweet acceptance" tell emotion rather than fully showing it. The narrative contains genuinely original elements in how it transforms objects into a celestial pattern, though the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable redemption structure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion despite its complex elements, weaving them into a meaningful narrative about reconciliation with past choices. The limited word count feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each sentence carrying significant weight. The creative incorporation of the star-sign pattern elevates what could have been a standard regret story into something more profound. The lingering impression of peaceful acceptance provides satisfying closure while inviting reflection on the price of duty versus love.</comment>
