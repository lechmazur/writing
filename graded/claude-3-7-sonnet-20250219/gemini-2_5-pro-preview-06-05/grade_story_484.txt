<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alistair has a distinctive voice with a dry, pragmatic attitude that fits his brewer profession. His motivation to embody his values is established but lacks deeper explorationâ€”we understand what he's doing but not enough about why these specific values matter to him personally. His character shows consistency in his flippant yet determined approach, but his backstory and internal conflicts remain largely unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with beginning (arrival at mansion), middle (confronting the corruption), and resolution (cleansing). The action of initiating the cleansing drives the story effectively, with logical cause-and-effect relationships. The story achieves satisfying closure within its constraints, connecting the mansion's purification to the renewed protest outside. However, the connection between the protest and the mansion's corruption could be more explicitly developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric work creates a palpable sense of wrongness in the mansion. The haunted setting perfectly complements the encroaching darkness concept. Sensory details like "like a bad smell you couldn't quite place" and "dusty spiral staircase" effectively immerse the reader. The contrast between the graveyard's stillness and the protest's energy creates a compelling tension that enhances the story's mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the mirror reflecting distorted light/self, the stain as corruption) and creates a satisfying conclusion. The central conflict of purging corruption is clear and resolved well. The theme of standing against evil through simple, determined action emerges naturally. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in Alistair's actions and reactions. However, the story would benefit from deeper exploration of the stakes and consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh descriptions like "uniquely generic sort of evil" and "wallpapered over its true horror." The character's voice feels authentic rather than formulaic. Some phrases like "focused point of light and intention" feel slightly overwrought. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout, though some descriptions of the corruption remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements cohesively, particularly merging the haunted mansion with the protest backdrop in a way that creates thematic resonance. The brevity works as a deliberate choice, allowing for a complete arc without feeling rushed. The simple cleansing action gains significance through its connection to larger societal resistance. The story leaves readers with thought-provoking connections between personal action and collective resistance, though some elements remain underdeveloped.</comment>
