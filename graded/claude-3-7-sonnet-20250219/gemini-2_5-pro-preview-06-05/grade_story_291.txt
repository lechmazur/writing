<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Captain Eva Rostova is effectively characterized through her interaction with the mirror maze and her past trauma. Her motivation to confront prejudice is clear and consistent, and her deliberate actions demonstrate her personality. The rope serves as both a physical token and metaphorical anchor to her identity. However, with limited dialogue or internal monologue, her character development relies heavily on narrative description rather than showing her evolution through her own voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the mirror maze confrontation to create a complete arc despite the word constraint. The action of "overlooking" drives the narrative forward naturally as Eva physically navigates the maze while emotionally processing past judgment. The cause-and-effect relationship between her deliberate movements and the dissolution of the echoes creates a satisfying progression. The story avoids feeling rushed while still delivering a clear beginning, middle, and resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mirror maze setting is masterfully integrated with the story's themes and action. The "calculated wilderness" atmosphere perfectly complements the character's internal struggle. Sensory details—stale popcorn, ozone, crackling static—create immersive texture. The contrast between the chaotic maze and the peaceful image of the orchard cat creates effective emotional counterpoint. The haunted setting naturally accommodates the supernatural manifestations of prejudice without feeling contrived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive impact through its metaphorical handling of prejudice. The physical navigation of the maze parallels Eva's emotional journey, creating effective subtext. Literary devices—particularly the mirrors as manifestations of judgment—are striking and purposeful. The ending delivers satisfaction through its quiet triumph of self-acceptance. The theme of refusing to be defined by others' perceptions emerges organically from the narrative. The use of "show don't tell" is particularly strong in depicting Eva's emotional resilience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central conceit and execution, with fresh metaphors like navigating the maze as an "asteroid field." However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward purple prose ("deliberately fractured," "a gait that was deliberately accidental"). The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic, with Eva's actions revealing her character naturally. The story's originality comes from how it transforms familiar tropes of confronting past trauma into something visually and conceptually distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than forced. The brief length works as a strength, creating a focused vignette with emotional resonance. The mirror maze concept provides an innovative framework for exploring prejudice. Some sentences could be streamlined for greater impact, but the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking in how elements are combined to create a meaningful exploration of self-acceptance in the face of judgment.</comment>
