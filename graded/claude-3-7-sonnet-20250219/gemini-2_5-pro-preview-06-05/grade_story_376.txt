<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vala's character is well-established through her motivation to "archive emotional patterns" rather than predict futures. Her stillness, methodical approach, and the contrast between her modest appearance and profound insight create a compelling character. Her method of emotional cartography through ink is distinctive and reflects her purpose. The character lacks some development in terms of personal history or internal conflict, but her essence is strongly conveyed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves smoothly from the client's arrival through the consultation to the emotional catharsis and payment. The zigzag action serves as both literal mark-making and metaphorical reflection of the client's emotional state. The plot follows a logical progression that culminates in a satisfying emotional revelation. While compact, the story achieves a clear beginning, middle, and end with effective pacing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse with its fusion of ancient and modern elements (polished concrete, seamless glass) creates a striking setting that enhances Vala's timeless quality. Sensory details are exceptional—the fjord at dusk, firelight, the ruby wine with its "memory of sun-scorched earth," and the amber inkwell's internal light all contribute to a richly immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the emotional archaeology taking place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of sensory imagery and metaphor, particularly in its treatment of emotion as something that can be mapped and preserved. The wine-tasting serves as an effective communion ritual before the deeper work begins. The emotional catharsis achieved when the client sees his "soul laid bare and honored" delivers genuine impact. The prose shows restraint and precision, allowing the emotional undercurrents to resonate without overstatement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of emotional cartography and the unusual tool of the amber inkwell. Language is generally fresh, avoiding clichés with specific sensory details and measured lyricism. However, some phrases like "gnawing fear" and "cathartic sob" verge on expected emotional descriptors. The writing occasionally becomes a bit too deliberately poetic ("as dusk bled purple across the fjord"), which hints at a striving for literary effect rather than organic expression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The brief length works well for the single consultation format, providing enough space for atmosphere and emotional resonance without unnecessary elaboration. The concept of emotional archiving rather than fortune-telling offers a fresh perspective on divination practices. The ending lands with appropriate weight, suggesting deeper implications about the value of being truly seen.</comment>
