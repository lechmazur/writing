<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The back-alley puppeteer identity informs both the character's skills ("hands that could coax life into marionettes") and creates an effective contrast with their unexpected role solving puzzles. The motivation to uncover hidden truth is consistent throughout, though the emotional connection to the discovered family history comes somewhat abruptly at the end rather than being hinted at earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from solving the riddle to discovering and deciphering the trunk's contents. The "remodeling" action drives the narrative forward naturally as the protagonist uses their puppeteer's intuition to arrange the stamps according to the gown's pattern. The personal connection revealed at the end provides closure, though the transition from random collection to love story map feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient Greek temple setting is vividly established with marble columns and Athena's statue. Sensory details are particularly strong - the "air of forgotten promises and cedar," the wedding gown "yellowed silk" that "whispers through fingers." The atmosphere of sacred solitude effectively complements both the puzzle-solving and the intimate discovery that follows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of conducting a symphony from scattered elements, transforming the protagonist from puppeteer to conductor. The theme of hidden connections across time and space emerges organically. The ending delivers emotional impact through the personal revelation, though the shift from abstract "truth" to specific family connection could have been seeded earlier for greater resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The writing shows originality in its central conceit of decoding stamps through tears in fabric. Some metaphors are fresh ("leather cover cracked like dry earth"), while others tend toward the generic. The narrative avoids most AI-typical patterns, maintaining consistent tone and perspective. However, certain phrases like "cacophony of miniature images" and "secret cartography of sorrow and hope" verge on purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The central metaphor of decoding scattered elements into meaningful patterns works both as plot device and thematic framework. The brief length generally serves the story well, though the final revelation would benefit from more development. The lingering idea of hidden connections across generations provides satisfying depth.</comment>
