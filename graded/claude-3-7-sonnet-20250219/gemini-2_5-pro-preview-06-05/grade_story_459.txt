<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's characterization effectively revolves around his relationship with silence and noise, establishing a clear motivation to help ghosts find peace. Leo's elegantly clumsy nature manifests meaningfully in his precision with machines versus his awkwardness with the spectral. His professional skills serve as both literal and metaphorical tools for his ghostly work. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into what drives his ghost-helping mission beyond the immediate scenario.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves remarkable cohesion within the tight word count. The narrative moves elegantly from Leo's discomfort with silence to his discovery of Elara, the investigation of her history, and her ultimate release. The "dissection" of her sorrow creates a compelling arc with satisfying resolution. The story maintains logical progression while building emotional resonance through the revelation about her art's lasting impact. The only minor weakness is the somewhat accelerated pace of Leo's discovery process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a unique, evocative setting that brilliantly connects to the ghost's artistic past. The juxtaposition of ephemeral art being preserved mirrors the protagonist's work with ghosts. The atmosphere masterfully balances technical precision (elevator mechanics) with ethereal elements (ghostly presence). Sensory details like the "hum and rattle" of the elevator, the "brittle thistle and lavender" crown, and dust "catching the light" create immersive, haunting imagery that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of legacy, preservation, and letting go. The metaphor of crossed signals and tangled wires for emotional pain is particularly effective. The ending delivers a poignant catharsis as Elara realizes her art endures beyond her expectations. The narrative skillfully balances concrete details with lyrical language, creating layers of meaning about what we leave behind. While dialogue is minimal, the nonverbal communication between characters conveys volumes, demonstrating sophisticated "showing" rather than "telling."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story displays genuine originality in its premise and execution. The ghost-elevator technician concept feels fresh, and metaphors like emotional pain as mechanical problems avoid clich√©. Sensory details are specific and meaningful rather than generic. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic. While occasionally the language becomes slightly ornate ("a girl made of quiet light and regret"), it generally serves the ethereal tone effectively. The narrative maintains a consistent voice throughout without the formulaic transitions typical of AI writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story succeeds remarkably in integrating diverse elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant whole. The elevator repair technician who sees ghosts isn't merely a quirky concept but essential to the narrative's exploration of fixing what's broken, both mechanically and spiritually. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each word serving the story's purpose. The lasting impression - that what we create may endure in ways we cannot foresee - demonstrates thematic depth that transcends the word limit. Minor stylistic polish could elevate it further, but the core execution is exemplary.</comment>
