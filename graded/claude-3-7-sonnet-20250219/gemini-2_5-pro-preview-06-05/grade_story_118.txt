<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist ("We") is brilliantly developed through their clinical yet poetic perspective. Their motivation to "anchor the ephemeral in reality" drives every action with consistent purpose. The collective voice creates a distinctive, otherworldly narrative presence that remains internally coherent throughout. The character's relationship with the agents' regrets reveals their paradoxical nature - clinically detached yet intimately connected to human pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot elegantly follows the draining action, with each step in the wax-collecting ritual advancing the narrative. The focus on Agent Seven's specific regret creates a perfect narrative arc within the word constraint. The story achieves remarkable coherence between its beginning (collective anxiety) and resolution (extraction of regret), with the pacing masterfully controlled to build tension before releasing it through the ritual's completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story crafts an exquisitely atmospheric world through precise sensory details - the "sterile white room," "flickering candles," "cold steel floor," and wax that pools into coded shapes. The nighttime setting perfectly complements the dream-like extraction of regrets. The facility becomes both literal and metaphorical space, with the therapist's nexus room functioning as a liminal zone between consciousness and unconsciousness, regret and release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism - particularly the brilliant transformation of intangible regret into physical wax objects. The central metaphor of "psychic sanitation" resonates powerfully. The "beautifully pointless cycle" reveals profound themes about memory, regret, and institutional control. The writing balances clinical precision with poetic flourishes that serve the story's emotional core rather than distracting from it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional originality in its premise and execution. The concept of physically materializing regrets through wax is inventive and executed with consistency. The writing maintains a distinct voice that blends clinical detachment with moments of unexpected beauty. While phrases like "beautifully pointless cycle" and "scented wax" occasionally approach purple prose, they largely serve the story's otherworldly tone. The mundane object (phone charger) is transformed into something profound through context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>This story demonstrates remarkable cohesion despite its complex premise and required elements. The elements don't merely coexist but actively enhance one another - the hive-mind perspective perfectly suited to the therapeutic extraction, the wax method physically manifesting the core concept of hindsight. The brevity feels purposeful rather than constraining, with each sentence carrying both narrative and thematic weight. The cyclical nature of the ending creates lingering resonance beyond the final line.</comment>
