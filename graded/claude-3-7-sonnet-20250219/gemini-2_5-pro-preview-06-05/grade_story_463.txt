<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is effectively established as a rule-bending sentinel with a dry, methodical voice that remains consistent throughout. Their motivation to use traditional methods rather than bureaucratic protocols creates genuine tension and reveals character depth. The character's knowledge of the Salt-Spray Reel adds meaningful personal history that justifies their unorthodox approach. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into what drives their preference for "personal touch" beyond professional disagreement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves with exceptional coherence from the crossing-off of the final name to the dance-based resolution. The structure follows a clear arc with the confiscation duty subverted into something more meaningful. The action of dancing as a method of spirit release is unusual but well-justified through the character's background. The cause-and-effect relationship between the dance and the ghost's liberation is established with economy and clarity. The pacing handles the word constraint remarkably well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric without overreliance on description. The cold floorboards, lamplight, and sensory details like the salt smell create immersive immediacy. The room temperature drop effectively signals the ghost's arrival. The lighthouse perfectly embodies the theme of eroding promisesâ€”automation making the keeper obsolete mirrors the bureaucratic approach displacing traditional methods. The bedroom setting intimately connects to Elias's suicide, making it the perfect stage for his liberation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional depth through its contrast of bureaucratic "soulless rituals" with personalized connection. The frayed rope transforming to dust that "smelled of salt and absolution" delivers a poetic resolution with genuine emotional resonance. The dance serves as both literal action and metaphor for finding harmony between duty and compassion. The theme of honoring tradition while completing one's mission is elegantly conveyed without heavy-handedness. The ending provides genuine catharsis rather than mere plot resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its approach to ghost-laying through shared cultural connection rather than exorcism. The writing avoids purple prose while maintaining poetic touches that serve the narrative. Sensory details are specific rather than generic ("smelled of salt and absolution"). The handling of the supernatural element feels fresh and grounded in character rather than formula. The tone stays consistent throughout, balancing procedural formality with human warmth in a way that reflects the protagonist's dueling loyalties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>This story achieves a cohesiveness that belies its word count, with all elements serving the central theme of bridging bureaucracy and tradition. The ghost encounter feels earned rather than contrived. The lighthouse setting, frayed rope, and salt-spray dance connect logically while creating emotional resonance. The brevity feels intentional rather than limiting, with no wasted words. The contrast between "official directive" and personal approach creates meaningful tension that drives the narrative. The story lingers after reading, suggesting depths beyond its literal ghost story.</comment>
