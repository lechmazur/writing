<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's character as a social media exorcist is distinctive and his motivation evolves organically from deletion to understanding. His curiosity about Vespera creates a compelling drive. However, his emotional connection to his subject remains somewhat underdeveloped - we understand his intellectual curiosity but not why this particular case affects him so deeply. The "indifferent enthusiasm" attribute is cleverly shown through his stream presentation but could be more consistently integrated throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc moves effectively from Kael's initial goal of digital erasure to his revelation about Vespera's true nature. The "reignite" action drives his journey appropriately. However, the middle section compresses what seems like significant investigation into a few sentences, and the conclusion feels somewhat rushed. The story achieves coherence but sacrifices some depth in the process, particularly in showing rather than telling about Kael's investigative journey.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall creates an effectively moody backdrop that mirrors the digital ghost hunting theme. The "quietly loud" atmosphere is skillfully established in the opening line with the vibrating chord. The contrast between digital and physical spaces enhances the theme of authenticity vs. virtual existence. The setting works as both literal location and metaphorical space where Vespera's journey began and ended, creating a satisfying circularity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The storytelling effectively weaves the concept of digital afterlife with tangible human connection. The receipt serves as a powerful physical anchor in an otherwise digital investigation. The metaphor of exorcism being transformed into preservation creates thematic resonance. However, the ending lacks the emotional punch it aims for, with Kael's final realization feeling somewhat predictable. The story shows rather than tells effectively in places but relies too much on exposition in others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The story presents an original concept in the "social media exorcist" profession, but some expressions feel formulaic ("a study in indifferent enthusiasm"). The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Vespera's character. While the moth sigil creates intrigue, the secret club circuit feels like a familiar trope without sufficient subversion. The ending line about being "hungry for the next mystery" reads as a conventional detective story closer rather than something fresh and distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about digital identity and authentic connection. The concept of hunting digital ghosts while uncovering real-life mysteries creates an interesting tension. However, the brevity constrains full exploration of the promising concept, and some transitions feel rushed. The story presents thoughtful ideas about how we exist both online and off, but doesn't quite achieve the depth its premise suggests is possible.</comment>
