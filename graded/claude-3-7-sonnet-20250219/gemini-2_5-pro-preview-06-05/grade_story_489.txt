<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's characterization as an unseen observer with a sacred duty is well-executed. Their voice is distinctive—ancient, patient, and purposeful. The aggressively kind motivation comes through clearly in the determination to shatter "comfortable falsehood to preserve a vital truth." However, we lack deeper personal stakes or background that would elevate this to exceptional character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot structure moves elegantly from observation to intervention, with clear causality throughout. The flinging of the whistle creates a perfect climactic moment that connects directly to the resolution. The arc feels complete despite brevity, with the tension building precisely to the moment of action. The only weakness is slight predictability in the resolution pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through contrasting imagery—ancient lighthouse versus modern city, sacred versus profane, sea wisdom versus human forgetting. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful: "salt-stained glass," the whale's "mournful frequency," the dancer's foot making "silent, momentous contact." The haunted lighthouse setting perfectly embodies the story's themes of preservation and timelessness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft, particularly in its thematic layering around tradition, memory, and cultural preservation. The central metaphor of the lighthouse guardian preserving wisdom works brilliantly. Strong subtext pervades the piece, inviting deeper interpretation. The resolution satisfies emotionally and intellectually. The only slight weakness is in relying occasionally on abstract concepts rather than concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise and fresh metaphors, there are moments where the language becomes overly formal or academic ("finalize the erasure," "a convergence of timelines stretched taut"). Some descriptions like "a beautiful poison" and "symphony of decay" verge on literary clichés. The narrative voice maintains consistency but occasionally sacrifices naturalness for poetic effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The assigned elements integrate seamlessly into a cohesive whole rather than feeling like obligatory inclusions. The story succeeds in creating depth beyond its explicit narrative, leaving the reader with lingering questions about cultural memory and preservation. The confined length feels deliberate rather than constraining. Minor weaknesses in some stylistic choices prevent this from reaching the highest score.</comment>
