<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dr. Alistair Finch is effectively established as an amiable scholar whose passion for bridging science and superstition drives his actions. His motivation to prove that physical structures hold resonant memories is clearly conveyed. However, without dialogue or deeper internal conflict, we don't fully experience the breadth of his personality beyond his intellectual pursuits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has elegant coherence with the lighthouse's vibration building to a revelatory moment that validates the character's life's work. The arc moves smoothly from setup to climax to resolution, with the crossword puzzle serving as both frame and payoff. The structure mirrors the resonance concept itself—building, peaking, and resolving with satisfying symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room provides an exceptional setting that perfectly complements the themes of historical resonance and scientific discovery. Sensory details—the weathered wood, the thrumming vibrations, the profound silence—create a richly atmospheric environment where the boundary between physical and metaphysical blurs convincingly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its interweaving of concrete scientific pursuit with mystical resonance. The extended metaphor of the lighthouse as both fixed point and time vessel (doubly singular) creates potent subtext about knowledge preservation. The narrative skillfully shows Alistair's emotional journey through physical sensation rather than stated feelings. The crossword puzzle's final clue delivers a subtle yet powerful resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and purposeful language, some phrases ("a beautiful, elegant bridge between superstition and science") lean toward telling rather than showing. Several metaphors feel somewhat expected rather than startlingly original. However, the central conceit of resonant memory in physical objects is handled with genuine imagination and the narrative maintains human nuance throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, creating a narrative where scientific curiosity and supernatural mystery coexist believably. The compression of the narrative feels deliberate rather than constrained. The lingering impact comes from its elegant fusion of the rational and mystical, leaving readers contemplating the boundaries between science and superstition. Minor weaknesses in originality are balanced by strong thematic coherence.</comment>
