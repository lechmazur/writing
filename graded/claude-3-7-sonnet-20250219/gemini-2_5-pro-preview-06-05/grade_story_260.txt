<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-established through his methodical, empathetic approach to soul-gathering. His cryptic crossword creator identity manifests beautifully in how he treats each soul as a puzzle needing resolution. His motivation feels genuine and consistent throughout, though his personality could be further distinguished through more direct characterization beyond his actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from Elias's selection of the key to the resolution of the lighthouse keeper's spiritual dilemma. The structure elegantly demonstrates cause and effect, with the rewriting action directly leading to the soul's transformation. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with a clear arc from selection to transformation to resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whisper collection point setting is brilliantly realized through sensory detailsâ€”flickering candles, ink-stained charts, cool brass against skin. The starless night creates a perfect backdrop for soul work. The atmosphere of sacred silence perfectly enhances Elias's delicate task, with the library of spectral murmurs feeling genuinely otherworldly yet tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its metaphorical exploration of reconciliation with the past. The lighthouse keeper's transformation is movingly rendered. The central theme of reframing painful histories rather than erasing them provides intellectual and emotional depth. The prose shows rather than tells, particularly in how the whisper "softens" as evidence of the keeper's acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI hallmarks through its consistent tone and thoughtful imagery. The metaphors are fresh and specific to the narrative context. Some phrasing occasionally verges on purple prose ("noble chaos," "profound empathy"), but these choices mostly serve the ethereal atmosphere. The narrative demonstrates originality in its conceptualization of soul-gathering as puzzle-solving rather than following predictable ghost story templates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds in weaving its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The elements enhance rather than limit the narrative. The brevity works to create a focused glimpse into an intriguing supernatural process. The lingering image of Elias selecting another key suggests a world beyond this single encounter, giving the piece depth despite its brevity.</comment>
