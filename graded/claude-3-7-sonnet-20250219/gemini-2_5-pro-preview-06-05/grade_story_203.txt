<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is a well-crafted reluctant exorcist whose stage fright manifests viscerally ("hands trembled," "throat tightened"). His motivation to free his daughter from familial phantoms provides compelling emotional stakes. The character's inner conflict between fear and determination creates genuine tension. His "small rebellion" against the ghost shows meaningful growth within the limited space.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from setup to confrontation to resolution, with the submerging action serving as a powerful climax. The narrative achieves a complete arc while maintaining tight pacing. The connection between the inherited lie and the ghost's power creates a logical foundation. However, the actual mechanism of the exorcism could be more clearly established before the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orbital debris workshop contrasted with pressed wildflowers from Earth creates a poignant juxtaposition that enhances the theme of generational displacement. Sensory details like the "shivering" water surface and temperature drop create palpable atmosphere. The setting's isolation amplifies both the haunting and Elias's vulnerable determination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ghost as metaphor for inherited trauma, with submerging the flowers representing confrontation with difficult truths. The whispered "You were supposed to believe" carries haunting subtext about familial obligation versus freedom. The final image of returning to the toy assembly creates a poignant resolution suggesting life continuing after emotional catharsis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose avoids AI hallmarks through varied sentence structures and emotionally nuanced descriptions. The ghost's manifestation is handled with restraint rather than predictable horror tropes. The central metaphor feels original rather than formulaic. A few phrases ("festering wound") approach cliché but generally the language maintains specificity and freshness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements naturally while maintaining thematic cohesion around inheritance, truth, and liberation. The flash fiction length feels appropriate rather than constrained. The emotional core—confronting familial ghosts to protect the next generation—resonates beyond the specific sci-fi setting, giving the piece universal relevance despite its brevity.</comment>
