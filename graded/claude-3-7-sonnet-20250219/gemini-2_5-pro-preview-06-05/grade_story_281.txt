<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character of Finn is well-developed despite the brevity. His dual identity as pickpocket and medium creates compelling tension. His motivation to challenge the status quo through supernatural communion is clearly established and consistent. The transformation from thief to conduit is effectively portrayed through his interactions with the dummy and ghosts. However, we could benefit from more insight into how his pickpocketing skills specifically inform his spectral communication abilities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc from Finn's arrival to his departure with newfound purpose. The poetry session effectively drives the plot, creating tension through the supernatural communication. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, demonstrating how Finn's impromptu poetry transforms both him and the spiritual energy of the lighthouse. The cause-effect relationship between his actions and the spectral response is logical, though the transition from haunting to political action could be more deeply developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly realized with "rust-eaten console" and "humming silence," creating a perfect crucible for supernatural communion. The atmosphere of spectral pressure is masterfully conveyed through phrases like "cold press of an audience" and "charged with the pressure of untold histories." The setting and ventriloquist dummy create a liminal space that enhances the transformative ritual. Sensory details like "thick air" and "spectral static" immerse the reader in this uncanny world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story succeeds in creating emotional resonance through the tension of the s√©ance and Finn's transformation. Literary devices shine particularly in metaphors like "bridge built of will and spectral static" and "his old life a shedding skin." The central conflict between remembrance and forgetting is effectively established. The theme of giving voice to the voiceless through art resonates powerfully. The ending creates satisfying closure while opening toward meaningful future action, though some descriptions occasionally verge on telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in its premise of a pickpocket-medium using poetry to communicate with ghosts. The writing avoids AI hallmarks like repetitive phrasing or generic descriptions. Metaphors like "iron heart" and "brass veins" feel fresh and specific to the context. However, occasional phrases like "scorching poise" appear twice, and some emotional states are directly stated rather than shown. The narrative maintains consistent tone but would benefit from more specificity in how the poetry actually functions as a medium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates its numerous assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that feels intentional rather than forced. The supernatural poetry medium creates a distinctive atmosphere that lingers after reading. Despite the brief length, the transformation of both character and setting feels complete. The shift from supernatural communication to political action gives the story unexpected depth. Some descriptions could be more concrete, and the mechanics of the ghost communication could be clearer, but overall, the piece achieves remarkable coherence and impact.</comment>
