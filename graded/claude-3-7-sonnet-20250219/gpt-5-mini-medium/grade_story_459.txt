<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is well-developed through his contradictory nature: technical yet spiritual, clumsy yet elegant. His motivations are clear—finding liberation by helping ghosts—and his actions consistently reflect his character. However, we lack deeper psychological insights into why he's drawn to ghosts or why "letting go" matters so profoundly to him personally, which prevents a truly exceptional character study.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively weaves the protagonist's ghost-seeing abilities with his elevator repair work and sand castle preservation, creating a coherent metaphorical framework about preservation versus release. However, the narrative lacks a clear inciting incident or central conflict beyond his ongoing ghost observations, and the ending, while thematically resonant, doesn't provide enough resolution to feel completely satisfying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates an exceptional metaphorical backdrop that brilliantly complements the theme of impermanence. Sensory details—the silica-filtered sunlight, damp gypsum smell, and the humming dehumidifier—create a hauntingly liminal atmosphere that perfectly bridges the worlds of the living and dead. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical landscape with remarkable cohesion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates sophisticated literary craft through its extended metaphors connecting preservation of sand castles with the protagonist's approach to ghosts. The writing employs evocative imagery and thoughtful symbolism throughout. The central theme of learning when to preserve versus when to release is powerfully conveyed. However, the story would benefit from a more defined narrative arc with clearer stakes to elevate its emotional impact from intellectually stimulating to deeply moving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose shows distinctive style with fresh metaphors like "dissect the silence between footsteps like a surgeon disassembling a clock." The sand castle preservation lab provides an original backdrop for exploring themes of impermanence. However, some sentences become unnecessarily complex and occasionally slip into overwrought phrasing. The central metaphor is intelligent but occasionally feels too deliberately constructed rather than organically discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, with each element serving the central themes of preservation, impermanence, and the tension between holding on and letting go. The prose style effectively balances lyrical elements with clarity. What prevents a higher score is the somewhat static narrative arc—while thematically rich, the story lacks sufficient dramatic tension or a compelling shift in the protagonist's circumstances to fully capitalize on its thoughtful premise.</comment>
