<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "distrustful mage" is well-developed through his contradictory nature (rebelliously docile) and his relationship to innovation. His distrust of applause and desire to keep "friends at arm's length" creates a coherent personality that drives his actions. However, his motivations could be more deeply excavated, and his emotional arc feels somewhat static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves from the mage's hesitation to his decision to demonstrate his invention, creating a satisfying mini-arc. The story achieves a sense of resolution when the wick glows. However, the action of "jettison" feels underutilized as a plot driver, and the cause-effect relationships occasionally get lost in the dense, poetic language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chimney sweep guild hall is richly rendered with "soot and memory," "rafters," and guild masters moving in "practiced circles." The atmosphere perfectly balances nostalgia with innovation, creating a textured environment where tradition and progress clash. Sensory details like the taste of "something like possibility" and the "soot-streaked moon" create immersive depth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story employs sophisticated metaphors (the shell's ridges remembering tides) and creates powerful subtext about innovation vs. tradition. The central tension between hiding and revealing one's gifts builds to a satisfying moment of decision. However, the dense prose occasionally obscures rather than illuminates, and some metaphors feel overwrought rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, the language occasionally becomes excessively ornate ("the soft, stubborn law of usefulness"). Some metaphors feel strained, and the emotional progression seems more intellectualized than genuinely felt. The consistent tone is commendable, but certain passages feel deliberately esoteric rather than authentically complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with literary merit. The dense, image-rich prose creates a distinctive atmosphere, though occasionally at the expense of clarity. The final image of the glowing wick provides satisfying closure while suggesting larger implications about innovation and tradition.</comment>
