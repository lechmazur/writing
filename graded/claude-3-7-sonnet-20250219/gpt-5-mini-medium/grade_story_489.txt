<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The unseen observer has a distinctive purpose and personality—"aggressively kind" and a "brusque protector"—though their invisibility creates an interesting tension. Their motivation to preserve traditions is consistent and drives their actions. However, the character lacks deeper dimension beyond this singular motivation, and their abstract nature (being unseen yet "fiercely present") limits the reader's ability to fully connect with them as a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of flinging the whistle creates a ritual moment that drives the plot, but the narrative structure feels more impressionistic than cohesive. While there is a clear beginning (the observer in the lighthouse) and end (tradition being rescued), the middle meanders between abstract imagery and concrete action. The cause-effect relationships between the whistle, whale song, and dancer remain somewhat nebulous, leaving the reader to fill significant logical gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly evoked with sensory details that create a liminal space between past and present, physical and spiritual. The atmosphere of "salt and memory" effectively supports the theme of preserving traditions. The integration of the lighthouse, sea, and theater creates a dreamlike quality that enhances the mystical tone. The environment becomes a character itself, responsive to the ritual being performed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story employs evocative imagery and unusual metaphors ("a voice like lighthouse glass," "the slow grammar of salt") that create a distinctive atmosphere. There's effective use of parallel action—the dancer's step synchronized with whale song—that builds thematic resonance. The central conflict between preservation and "polite forgetfulness" emerges clearly. However, the abstract language occasionally obscures rather than illuminates meaning, and the emotional impact is somewhat diffused by the density of poetic language.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The writing displays originality in its lyrical approach and unconventional metaphors. However, there's an overreliance on elaborate phrases ("the slow grammar of salt," "a ledger being unrolled") that occasionally feel more performative than purposeful. The prose style maintains consistency but sometimes prioritizes poetic density over clarity. While there are fresh images and constructions, some passages strain with an excess of adjectives and abstract concepts that create distance rather than intimacy with the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinctive mystical-maritime atmosphere. Its strengths lie in atmospheric evocation and thematic resonance about preservation of cultural memory. However, it sacrifices some narrative clarity for poetic density, and the abstract nature of both character and action creates emotional distance. The story leaves the reader with intriguing questions about ritual and memory, but could benefit from more concrete grounding to balance its ethereal qualities.</comment>
