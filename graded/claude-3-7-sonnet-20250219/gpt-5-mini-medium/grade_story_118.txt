<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist is a striking and original character with a distinct personality infused with "merry bitterness." Their multiple-consciousness nature manifests in consistently peculiar behaviors that align with their motivation. However, we don't get enough insight into the therapist's own desires or struggles beyond their professional function, creating some emotional distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from ritual beginning to meaningful resolution, with the draining action effectively driving the narrative. The candle wax coding creates a strong central activity. However, the story occasionally loses focus in its poetic descriptions, and some cause-effect relationships (particularly why this specific ritual matters) remain underdeveloped within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The secret facility setting is rendered with vivid, sensory-rich details ("hummed like a living syllabus," "small alarms ticked in polite counterpoint"). The atmosphere perfectly balances clinical detachment with ritualistic intimacy, creating a unique liminal space that enhances the central concept of ephemeral-to-tactile transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in the transformation of wax to map and regret to protocol. The subtext about vulnerability and healing runs throughout. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by occasionally overwrought language and abstraction that keeps readers at arm's length from fully connecting with the characters' internal experiences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers original concepts and fresh metaphors, the writing occasionally becomes too self-consciously literary, with phrases like "papery susurration" and "grief runes to precise operating instructions" that feel more performative than authentic. The emotional landscape remains somewhat generic despite the specificity of the scenario, relying more on telling than showing the trainees' transformations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of memory, regret, and transformation. The hive-mind therapist and wax-coding ritual are genuinely inventive. However, the dense, sometimes overly ornate prose obscures rather than illuminates the emotional core, and the characters beyond the therapist remain underdeveloped archetypes rather than fully realized individuals.</comment>
