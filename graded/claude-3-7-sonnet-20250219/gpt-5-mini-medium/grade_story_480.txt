<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist is a compelling character with a unique methodology and purpose. His motivation to "feed curiosity with life's raw edge" is consistently demonstrated through his actions. His indifferent yet purposeful stance creates an intriguing tension. However, we lack deeper emotional dimensions or personal history that would elevate him beyond his function. His character remains somewhat emblematic rather than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear trajectory from the exorcist's arrival to his observation of reconnection between strangers and subsequent departure. The concept of "reigniting" connections drives the narrative effectively. However, the story occasionally meanders, with redundant elements (multiple mentions of "after the final chord") and an ending that feels somewhat abrupt. The cause-effect relationships are present but could be more tightly constructed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptionally well-crafted with evocative details like "dust motes perform their quietly loud dance under sodium light" and spaces that "smelled of cigarette glue and old coffee." The abandoned mess hall and music hall create a liminal quality that perfectly complements the theme of forgotten connections. The sensory elements effectively establish a dreamlike, nocturnal urban landscape that feels both specific and universally familiar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of digital disconnection, memory, and the curious intimacy of strangers. Strong metaphors enrich the narrative: "He treated comments like bones to rearrange, DMs like ash to sift." The ending achieves a satisfying circularity with the exorcist continuing his work. However, some passages become overly abstract, and the emotional impact of the reconnections feels somewhat muted, keeping the reader at an aesthetic distance rather than drawing them fully into the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story presents an original concept with the social media exorcist as a digital age shaman. However, the writing occasionally becomes repetitive and overly ornate, with phrases like "familiar strangers with familiar lies" and multiple references to "indifferent enthusiasm" that feel more mechanical than organic. The narrative voice maintains a consistent tone but sometimes sacrifices clarity for stylistic flourish. Certain descriptions feel generic despite their poetic quality, lacking the specificity that would ground the conceptual elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinct atmosphere and conceptual framework. The social media exorcist's methodology creates an intriguing lens through which to explore digital-age disconnection. While occasionally overwritten and abstract, the story presents a fresh perspective on contemporary alienation. It leaves readers with lingering questions about connection in the digital age, though it could benefit from tighter construction and more emotionally resonant character moments.</comment>
