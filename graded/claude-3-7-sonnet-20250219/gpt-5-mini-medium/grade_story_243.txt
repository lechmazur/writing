<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jumpy necromancer's personality is consistent with her nervousness and purpose. Her motivation to unmask the icon is clear, and her necromantic abilities are cleverly integrated with her forensic method. However, we lack deeper emotional complexity or internal conflict beyond her mission, and her "jumpiness" feels more stated than demonstrated through meaningful character choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from investigation to revelation to presentation of findings. The method of analyzing paint drips drives the story forward consistently and connects logically to the resolution. However, some transitions feel abrupt, and the revelation itself—finding "a ledger full of apologies"—lacks sufficient buildup to deliver its intended impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly realized with specific details like "pixellated tiles," "sprite form," and "twitching avatars." The fusion of digital aesthetics with necromantic elements creates a distinctive atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's exploration of manufactured legends. The setting actively enhances both the action and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of myth-making and truth-seeking in digital culture. The prose is richly textured with striking imagery ("pixels bled into confession"). However, the emotional impact is diluted by dense, sometimes overwrought language, and the resolution feels too neat given the buildup. The conflict lacks sufficient stakes to generate genuine tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution shows AI markers: overly precise transitions between sentences, unnecessarily complex vocabulary ("necromantic sense that read dried choices like tarot"), and a tendency toward abstraction rather than specific sensory detail. The prose frequently prioritizes flowery description over emotional authenticity, with phrases like "pulse made her hands falter" instead of showing genuine human reaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores themes of authenticity and myth-making. The video game setting provides a fresh lens for examining idol worship. However, the prose often becomes unnecessarily ornate, obscuring rather than enhancing meaning, and the emotional stakes remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
