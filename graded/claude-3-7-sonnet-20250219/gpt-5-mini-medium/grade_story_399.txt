<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The caretaker's grumpiness and complex relationship with trauma gives him psychological depth. His careful actions with the sand mandala reveal his methodical nature, and his motivation to maintain order is consistent throughout. However, the character remains somewhat opaque - we understand his methods more than his personal history, which limits full emotional connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the caretaker's internal struggle with his external duty, creating a satisfying parallel between managing the crypt and managing grief. The "jiggle" action recurs meaningfully as a ritual tied to memory. However, the narrative sometimes prioritizes poetic language over clear progression, leaving some cause-effect relationships more implied than explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room is vividly rendered with "crystal light, velvet darkness, and the small machinery of ritual." The setting perfectly complements the atmospheric tone and the stargazing timeframe. The crystals that "hung like captive moons" and reflections of constellations create a richly immersive environment that enhances the themes of inner and outer observation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storytelling employs sophisticated metaphors that equate emotional processing with physical maintenance, creating layers of meaning. The concept that "trauma was an enumerated geography" and grief can be "channeled" through patterns shows rather than tells the character's coping mechanisms. The ending brings satisfying resolution through the caretaker's small smile, suggesting growth. However, some metaphors become slightly overwrought, occasionally sacrificing clarity for poetic effect.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids formulaic language through fresh metaphors like "grief could multiply singular into fewer, steadier forms rather than fragment into raids upon the heart." The psychological nuance feels authentic, and the handling of trauma through ritual shows originality. However, occasionally the prose becomes slightly purple with phrases like "the small machinery of ritual that made each night feel like a treaty between living will and buried past," which risks prioritizing linguistic flourish over narrative substance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, particularly in how it connects the caretaker's inner landscape with his physical environment. The exploration of trauma through ritual creates philosophical depth beyond the narrative's surface. While some passages could benefit from clearer language, the story leaves a lingering impression about the careful management of grief. The brevity works well, giving just enough to suggest a larger world and deeper history.</comment>
