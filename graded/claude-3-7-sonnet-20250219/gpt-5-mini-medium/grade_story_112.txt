<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's transformation from "aimless traveler" to purposeful preserver is effectively rendered. His motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is consistently demonstrated through his meticulous work. The "factually imaginative" attribute manifests well in his approach to recipes and writing systems. However, the character lacks a proper name and deeper backstory that might elevate the portrayal from effective to exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the traveler's arrival to his departure with newfound purpose. The action of grilling drives the narrative coherently, connecting recipes to writing systems in a logical way. The story achieves a sense of completeness despite length constraints. Some transitions between paragraphs feel slightly abrupt, and the ending, while thematically satisfying, could offer more concrete resolution about the specific recipes preserved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The writing system archive as setting is richly rendered and ingeniously connected to culinary preservation. The atmosphere of scholarly reverence mixed with sensory culinary experience creates a unique, immersive environment. The timeframe element is subtly woven in, suggesting both immediacy and timelessness. Exceptional sensory details connect abstract writing systems to concrete tastes and smells, creating a multisensory world that feels both mysterious and tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes profound emotion around cultural preservation and legacy. Metaphors connecting writing to cooking are fresh and consistent. The central theme of preservation as resistance against cultural erasure emerges organically. The narrative skillfully "shows" the character's emotional journey through his actions rather than telling. The subtext about colonization and indigenous knowledge adds depth. The ending provides emotional resolution while maintaining a sense of ongoing mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution. The metaphors connecting writing systems to culinary arts feel fresh. However, some passages contain overly ornate language that borders on purple prose. Several sentences are structurally similar, creating a rhythmic pattern that occasionally feels formulaic. The emotional tenor, while generally well-handled, occasionally relies on direct statements of feeling ("mournful elation") rather than showing it through character action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the constraint framework. The writing system archive and cooking metaphors work in harmony rather than feeling forced together. The brevity feels intentional rather than limiting. The piece leaves readers with lingering questions about cultural preservation and the relationship between language and sensory experience. Some slight overwriting and occasional reliance on telling rather than showing prevents a higher score.</comment>
