<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "cleverly naive" knight is well-developed through his contradictory nature - armor dented but heart stubborn. His motivation to sabotage the regret machine while preserving joy shows nuanced characterization. The character's interaction with the jigsaw edge reveals his methodical yet hopeful approach. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into his personal stakes or history that drives this mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure masterfully connects the knight's mission with the syncing method in a cohesive arc. The neutralization of the machine creates perfect narrative tension, with the jigsaw piece serving as both tool and symbol. The story achieves remarkable completeness with a clear beginning (discovery), middle (frequency matching), and resolution (sabotage that preserves). The pacing expertly balances action with contemplative moments despite the constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mystic orchard within a hedge maze creates an immersive liminal space perfectly suited for memory work. Sensory details are exceptional - "crushed quince and static," shadows holding stories "like unpicked fruit," and the mechanical whirs braiding with cricket songs. The flickering streetlamp timeframe creates a threshold atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of transition and transformation. The world feels fully realized and integral to the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through its layered metaphors and resonant symbolism. The jigsaw edge as both literal tool and metaphor for fragmented memories shows remarkable narrative economy. The emotional journey balances technical problem-solving with profound philosophical questions about memory and loss. The ending achieves poignant resolution while maintaining thematic complexity. The story powerfully explores how healing requires both preservation and release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its concept and execution, particularly in the frequency-matching mechanic and the machine that cycles regrets. However, some phrasing occasionally verges on purple prose ("victory salted with grief"), and certain metaphors ("paper lanterns") feel slightly conventional. The emotional nuance is generally well-handled through showing rather than telling, though a few transitions between paragraphs feel somewhat abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite its numerous elements, weaving them into a seamless narrative where each component feels essential rather than obligatory. The balance between abstract concept and concrete detail is masterfully handled. The brevity feels purposeful, allowing just enough space for the story's emotional and philosophical weight without overexplaining. The lingering question of what memories are worth preserving versus releasing gives the piece significant depth beyond its literal narrative.</comment>
