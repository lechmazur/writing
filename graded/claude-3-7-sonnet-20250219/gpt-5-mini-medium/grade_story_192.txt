<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Livia's character is well-developed through her distinctive methodology and philosophical approach. Her motivation to find human connection in a digital world is consistent and drives her actions throughout. Her relationship with the "technically organic" attribute is particularly strong, shaping her approach to her work. However, we could benefit from slightly more emotional depth or personal history to fully understand why this particular quest matters so deeply to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Livia's observation to discovery to creation of a community ritual. The action of "corralling" effectively drives the narrative as she gathers both physical objects and ephemeral disturbances. While the story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, the cause-effect relationship between the poltergeist activity and the photograph discovery feels slightly underdeveloped, leaving some logical gaps in an otherwise well-structured narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman villa creates a powerful juxtaposition with digital-age concerns, effectively blending ancient architecture with contemporary themes. The setting's features (impluvium, peristyle) are seamlessly integrated rather than merely decorative. Sensory details like "dust and light" and "dusk pooled in the impluvium" create a tangible atmosphere that enhances the spectral elements while supporting the character's mission of finding authentic connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable depth through its exploration of attention as meaning-making in a digital world. The metaphor of cleaning as truth-seeking and the altar as community-building are elegantly developed. The ending satisfyingly pays off the "wager of faith" concept with human connection. The writing shows restraint and precision, avoiding excessive explanation while still conveying complex ideas about technology, faith, and human interaction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, particularly in how it melds the supernatural with digital-age alienation. The language avoids generic phrasing and creates fresh imagery like "She felt a surge of kinship that confirmed her wager." The narrative maintains consistent tone and style throughout. The only slight weakness is occasional density of language that borders on purple prose in a few passages, though this remains within acceptable literary boundaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinctive literary voice. The elements feel organic to the narrative rather than forced inclusions. The brevity works in its favor, creating a concentrated experience that leaves lingering questions about connection in a digital age. The story demonstrates creative thinking in its marriage of ancient architecture, supernatural elements, and contemporary concerns about human connection.</comment>
