<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scout's fierce loyalty is established early and shapes her actions, though her evolution from loyal scout to meditation teacher happens rather abruptly. Her motivation to test hypotheses about "balancing inside storms" connects well to meditation, but her personality lacks sufficient complexity beyond her determination. The character's use of comedic routines as a meditation method is distinctive, though we don't get enough of her voice to make her fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the action of "radicalizing" to transform a personal meditation practice into a community activity during a blackout. The progression from solo practice to teaching others creates a satisfying arc that feels complete despite the word constraints. The cause-effect relationship between the outage, the scout's meditation, and the community's participation is well-established. The pacing effectively captures the gradual spread of the practice without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a city blackout creates a powerful atmosphere of isolation and elevation above chaos. Sensory details are exceptional—the smell of "old varnish and moth wings," the air that "smelled faintly of ozone," and moths that "skittered against windows like punctuation." The setting metaphorically enhances the meditation theme, with the tower providing both literal and figurative perspective. The "sanctified dread" tone perfectly complements the tension between chaos and stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses moths as a metaphor for erratic thoughts and the tower as isolation needed for focus. The transformation of individual practice to communal experience creates emotional resonance. The story shows rather than tells the power of meditation through concrete images like moths becoming "syllables that spelled patience." The conflict between internal storms and sought-after peace is well-established. The theme of finding calm within chaos emerges organically from the narrative elements rather than being stated directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the writing shows strong imagery and metaphor, some passages feel overwrought ("hinterlanded in its blackout"). The story avoids most AI-typical patterns but occasionally relies on abstract descriptions rather than concrete details. Some phrases feel unnecessarily complex ("liturgy of warning"). The story demonstrates originality in its approach to meditation as coded routines and avoids predictable emotional states, though the transformation of skeptics to followers happens with limited resistance or complexity. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion—the moth tower, blackout, and meditation practice feel naturally interconnected rather than forced together. The brief length works well for the meditation theme, mirroring the focused attention it describes. The writing occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic language, but generally supports the meditative tone. The lingering image of community formed through shared stillness gives the piece depth beyond its literal narrative. The transformation from individual to communal practice provides a satisfying resolution.</comment>
