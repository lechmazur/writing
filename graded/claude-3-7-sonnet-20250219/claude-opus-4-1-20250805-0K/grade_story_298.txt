<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Li Wei's characterization as a chameleon actor who embodies others to solve mysteries is compelling and original. His ability to transform into the missing child's mother and then the child herself demonstrates his method effectively. The character arc from professional distance to vulnerability when he "became not another character but himself" provides meaningful development. However, his rationally impulsive nature could be more consistently demonstrated throughout rather than merely stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships driving the narrative forward. Wei's method of embodying others to solve the mystery propels the plot logically toward resolution. The "sunlight through debris" concept brilliantly transforms from atmospheric detail to plot mechanism when Wei follows the light patterns to discover the hidden chamber. The pacing effectively balances setup, investigation, and resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The post-oil world and reimagined Forbidden City create a richly realized setting that's both familiar and transformed. The vertical greenhouse palace with "hydroponic gardens climbing ancient dragon columns" and "tomatoes growing through cracks in Ming dynasty murals" presents vivid, specific imagery that merges past and future. The atmosphere of "anxious serenity" permeates the prose through contrasting elements of beauty amid collapse, perfectly supporting both the setting and Wei's character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of performance versus authenticity, survival through art, and finding humanity in post-collapse society. The central conflict revolves around both the missing child and Wei's inner struggle to connect genuinely beyond his personas. The imagery of light fracturing through debris serves as a powerful metaphor for finding truth amid ruins. The ending provides emotional resonance as Wei discovers that his greatest performance is authenticity, creating a satisfying thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and setting details, avoiding obvious post-apocalyptic tropes. However, the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern of the detective finding redemption through solving the case. Some phrases like "anxious serenity" feel deliberately paradoxical in a way that draws attention to the writing rather than serving the narrative. The story shows genuine emotional nuance but occasionally slips into telling emotional states rather than showing them through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The integration of assigned elements feels natural rather than forced, with each contributing meaningfully to the narrative. The post-oil setting, chameleon actor, and reimagined palace work together cohesively to create a distinctive world and story. The prose balances lyrical description with narrative momentum, though occasionally veers toward overwritten passages. The story leaves readers with the lingering idea that in a world of performance and survival, genuine human connection remains our most valuable resource.</comment>
