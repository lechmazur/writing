<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-developed through her relationship with the amber pendant, her diving-scarred fingers, and her gift of hearing the dead through water damage. Her motivation to step out of her sister's shadow is clear and consistent throughout. The juxtaposition with her deceased sister Elena creates meaningful depth. However, some aspects of her personality could be more distinct, and her emotional transformation feels slightly rushed within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects Marina's visit to the abandoned carnival with her personal journey of grief and self-discovery. The structure creates a satisfying arc from her arrival alone to her decision to "cast her own shadow." The connections between Tommy's suicide, Elena's death, and Marina's transformation are coherent and meaningful. The only weakness is that some causal relationships feel slightly compressed, particularly the revelation about why Elena dove without Marina.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival creates a hauntingly effective backdrop for this Halloween story about the thinning veil between worlds. Sensory details like "peeling paint," "stale air," and moonlight through "broken roof slats" vividly evoke decay and liminality. The shooting gallery with its "painted ducks forever mid-swim" and "rifles rusted in their chains" perfectly symbolizes Marina's suspended grief. The atmosphere masterfully supports both the supernatural elements and emotional journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable emotional impact through its layered symbolism—the amber preserving not just an insect but "a moment of defiant life frozen before surrender," paralleling both Tommy's suicide and Marina's emotional state. The central theme of completing unfinished stories resonates powerfully. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. The ending offers meaningful resolution while leaving space for the reader. The only weakness is that some metaphorical connections are stated rather than revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its conceptual framework and metaphorical connections. The amber mosquito as a symbol for trapped potential is particularly effective. However, some phrasings ("joyfully melancholic tone," "arousing memories") feel slightly manufactured, and certain emotional transitions happen too neatly. The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. Still, the core concept and execution avoid major clichés and demonstrate creative handling of the assigned elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores grief, identity, and the courage to forge one's own path. The abandoned carnival setting, the amber pendant, and the half-written suicide note work together to create both atmosphere and thematic resonance. The brevity feels purposeful rather than limiting. While some emotional transitions could be more gradual, the story leaves readers with meaningful questions about how we complete our own narratives and step out of others' shadows.</comment>
