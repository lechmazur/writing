<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silent Jade's characterization as a calm assassin is consistently woven through her methodical actions and emotional restraint. Her motivation to subvert the prophecy shows depth beyond mere killing.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft with its layered metaphors and thematic depth.
