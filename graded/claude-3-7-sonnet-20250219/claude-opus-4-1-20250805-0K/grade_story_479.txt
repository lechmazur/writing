<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morgana is well-established as a character with clear motivation and a distinct personality. Her profession as a "glamorous undertaker" is seamlessly integrated into her character, giving her actions purpose. Her dedication to preserving digital memories shows consistency with her family tradition. However, we could benefit from slightly more internal conflict or complexity to elevate her from archetype to fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects the traditional preservation of the dead with digital preservation, creating a coherent narrative arc. The action of "elongating" digital presences drives the story forward naturally. The ritual framework provides clear cause-and-effect relationships, and the story achieves a satisfying sense of completion within its constraints. The pacing balances exposition and action effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world-building excels in blending the mystical with the technological. The server room setting works perfectly with the digital preservation concept, while sensory details like "the metallic scent of mixed pigments" create immersive atmosphere. The juxtaposition of ancient ritual tools with abandoned MySpace profiles creates a unique temporal tension that enhances the story's themes about memory and permanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves emotional resonance through its meditation on digital afterlives and forgotten identities. Rich metaphors (profiles as "chrysalises") and the central theme of memory preservation create layers of meaning. The story effectively shows rather than tells Morgana's emotional connection to her work. The ending leaves readers with a lingering sense of both loss and preservation that resonates beyond the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of digital preservation rituals, avoiding predictable tropes. However, some descriptions like "iridescent mixture" and "fractal patterns" feel somewhat generic. While the emotional core feels authentic, certain phrases like "jubilant remorse" draw attention to themselves as writerly constructions. The narrative maintains consistent tone and avoids abrupt shifts, but occasionally leans toward slightly ornate language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The digital preservation concept feels fresh and thoughtful, not merely a vehicle for required elements. While occasionally veering into slightly ornate language, the style generally supports the story's themes of tradition and transformation. The narrative leaves readers with meaningful questions about digital legacies and memory preservation.</comment>
