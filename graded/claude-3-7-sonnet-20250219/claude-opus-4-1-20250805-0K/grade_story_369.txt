<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-realized through his fanatical pursuit of puzzle-making and his "optimistically bitter" worldview. His motivation to track spiritual development shapes his actions consistently. The character's obsession with "mapping the unmappable" reveals depth, though some of his internal contradictions could be more fully explored within the word limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete arc within its constraints. The mysterious packages drive the plot forward naturally, and the revelation that Elias has been "solving a puzzle about himself" creates a satisfying structural revelation. The approaching boat at the end creates effective tension that ties back to the opening premise about the letters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse transformed into a workshop creates a vivid, atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the character's isolation and obsession. The description of "metallic vines" and the echo "like a tired ghost" provides exceptional sensory detail that enhances the mood of mysterious revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in how the physical puzzles represent spiritual and psychological states. The theme of transformation through confronting hidden truths is effectively conveyed. The ending creates meaningful tension and philosophical weight without overexplaining. The lighthouse beam activating autonomously is a particularly effective image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of mechanical puzzles that measure spiritual states. The writing avoids common clich√©s and demonstrates a consistent style. Some phrases like "optimistically bitter" and "lethargic excitement" create fresh contradictions that feel authentic to the character. A few sentences could be tightened to avoid slight overwriting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements seamlessly, creating a cohesive narrative where each component serves the whole. The lighthouse setting, the puzzle-maker's character, and the mysterious packages all work in concert. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, and the story leaves the reader with lingering questions about transformation and self-discovery.</comment>
