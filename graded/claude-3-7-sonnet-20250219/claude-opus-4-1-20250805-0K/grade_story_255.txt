<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nondescript seer is convincingly portrayed with a distinct voice that perfectly embodies "innocent cynicism." Their analytical nature manifests organically through their pattern recognition abilities and methodical approach to decryption. The character's motivation to expose corruption feels authentic, though their backstory remains somewhat underdeveloped in the tight word count. The sensory trigger of petrichor effectively demonstrates how their gift works rather than simply telling us about it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly connects the encrypted drive, Morrison's retirement, and the seer's special abilities into a cohesive narrative with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The act of untangling builds tension effectively as the seer cracks the password through psychological insight rather than brute force. The story achieves a satisfying arc from discovery to resolution without feeling rushed, culminating in the meaningful action of distributing and then destroying the evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower provides an exceptional atmospheric backdrop that mirrors the story's themes of neglect and revelation. The petrichor—earth awakening after drought—creates a powerful sensory metaphor for long-buried truths finally surfacing. The contrast between stale party decorations and cleansing rain enriches the mood of delayed justice. Sensory details (rain drumming on glass, wilting balloons, the scent triggering insight) create an immersive, evocative setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—Prometheus bringing fire/truth to humanity, rain washing clean years of corruption, and the USB drive as both relic and seed. The contrast between Morrison's broken life and the seer's unremarkable existence creates poignant subtext about the personal cost of justice. The final image of justice smelling like rain delivers a powerful emotional and thematic resonance that lingers beyond the story's conclusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in how it connects sensory triggers to analytical insight and transforms standard thriller elements into something more literary. The petrichor metaphor feels fresh rather than clichéd, and emotional states are conveyed through action and imagery rather than direct statement. The prose avoids excessive ornamentation while maintaining distinctive style. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout without relying on formulaic transitions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole where each component enhances rather than constrains the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, allowing just enough space for the story's themes to breathe without unnecessary exposition. The combination of thriller elements with literary techniques creates a distinctive voice. The final image of justice as rain effectively distills the story's central concerns into a lingering, resonant conclusion.</comment>
