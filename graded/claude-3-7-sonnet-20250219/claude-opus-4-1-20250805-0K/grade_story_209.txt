<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The woodsman's characterization is impressively layered, with his guilt about the hairbrush theft creating a compelling through-line that shapes his actions. His decades-long railway mapping—ostensibly for historical preservation but actually a search for his brother—reveals complex motivations. The character's emotional journey from guilt to release feels authentic. The only weakness is that his "artfully messy" attribute feels somewhat superficial compared to his deeper traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure masterfully connects the hairbrush theft, the brother's disappearance, and the electromagnetic phenomena in a coherent narrative. The short-circuit action creates a perfect climactic moment, bridging the supernatural and emotional elements. Despite the brief format, the story achieves a complete arc from guilt to forgiveness to resolution. The parallel timing of his wife's death and his brother's forgiveness creates a poignant symmetry that elevates the narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is brilliantly conceived as both literal setting and metaphorical space where past and present, life and death intersect. The electromagnetic imagery creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that supports the supernatural elements without feeling contrived. The sensory details of crackling frequencies, sparks between bristles and metal, and the hospital monitor's beeps create a vivid, immersive environment. The garden becomes a liminal space where reconciliation across time becomes possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional depth through its interwoven metaphors of electromagnetic waves, abandoned railways, and family connections. The hairbrush transforms from mere object to powerful symbol of guilt and eventual redemption. The parallel timing of forgiveness and loss creates profound impact. The narrative skillfully balances supernatural elements with human emotion, showing rather than telling the protagonist's transformation. The ending resonates with both closure and new beginning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its unconventional setting and electromagnetic metaphor. The narrative avoids predictable reconciliation tropes by using the surreal radio garden as mediator. While a few phrases like "tears carved paths through his weathered face" verge on familiar imagery, the overall execution feels fresh. The emotional nuance shown in the woodsman's "sound both joyful and broken" demonstrates sophisticated character rendering. The story maintains consistent tone throughout with no artificial shifts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous required elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced—particularly impressive with the radio wave garden and electromagnetic imagery. The brief length feels purposeful, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The parallel timing of forgiveness and loss creates lingering resonance. The story's exploration of guilt, honesty, and reconciliation transcends its supernatural framework to deliver genuine emotional impact.</comment>
