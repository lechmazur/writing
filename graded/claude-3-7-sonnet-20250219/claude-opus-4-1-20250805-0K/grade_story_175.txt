<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corvus embodies "innocently mischievous" with remarkable consistency. His methodology of using the decaying sign reveals his cunning nature, while his interactions with the villagers demonstrate his playful wisdom. His motivation to acquire forbidden knowledge drives every action logically, and his dialogue carries a distinct voice of weathered wisdom with subtle subversion. The empty birdcage metaphor brilliantly extends his characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from Corvus's arrival to his departure with acquired knowledge. His explanatory method creates escalating tension and naturally drives narrative progression. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships between Corvus's nightly interpretations and the Spore Singers' emerging interest. The seven-night structure provides elegant pacing with a satisfying resolution that transforms both protagonist and setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom village is exquisitely rendered with bioluminescent details that create an otherworldly atmosphere perfectly suited to the story's themes. The setting actively participates in the narrative through the mycelial chambers and weathered sign. Sensory details are precise and evocative—"wind through hollow logs," "script that shed paint like molting feathers"—creating an immersive experience where the physical world and philosophical concepts seamlessly intertwine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—the decaying sign, empty cage, and mockingbird metaphors all reinforce the theme of crumbling illusions. The narrative consistently shows rather than tells, particularly in how Corvus's methods reveal his character. The philosophical revelation about "forbidden names" delivers a profound payoff that elevates the entire piece. The ending achieves both closure and expansion, leaving lingering questions about knowledge and tradition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates distinctive style with fresh, unexpected metaphors ("script that shed paint like molting feathers") and avoids predictable patterns. The mushroom village setting feels genuinely original rather than derivative fantasy. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout without artificial shifts. While occasionally teetering on purple prose ("magnificently untamed"), the language generally serves the story's mythic quality without becoming excessive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, contributing to a narrative that balances folklore qualities with philosophical depth. The brevity feels deliberate, with every sentence advancing character, plot, or theme. The story's exploration of knowledge, tradition, and perception leaves readers with provocative questions about reality itself—a remarkable achievement in such limited space.</comment>
