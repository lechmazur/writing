<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization displays impressive depth for a short piece. His motivation to manipulate time through buttons is rooted in personal loss, creating emotional resonance. The tension between selfish desire and inherited responsibility shows meaningful development. However, his shift from wanting to "wield power" to accepting responsibility feels slightly rushed, needing more space to fully explore the psychological transition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves remarkable coherence despite its brevity. The concept of timeline manipulation drives the narrative with logical cause-effect relationships. The story presents a complete arc from desire to realization to acceptance. The pacing efficiently establishes the premise, builds to a climax of temporal chaos, and resolves with Marcus's choice, though the climactic moment could benefit from slightly more development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The planetarium-turned-nightclub setting brilliantly merges the cosmic with the mundane, perfectly complementing the time manipulation concept. Sensory details—the thrumming bass, rippling mirrors, flickering walls—create a vivid, disorienting atmosphere that enhances the "unraveling" theme. The harbor waters bookending the story provides elegant symmetry, reinforcing Marcus's character and profession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of grief, responsibility, and sacrifice. The buttons as "patches" for reality provides a fresh metaphor for inherited duty. The final image of Marcus returning to dark waters where "broken things waited for patient hands" resonates beyond the narrative, elegantly tying his profession to his new role. The theme of accepting painful reality rather than seeking to change it offers meaningful depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical pitfalls, with consistent tone and vivid imagery. However, certain phrases ("catastrophic power," "timelines hemorrhaged") edge toward melodrama. While the concept is original, the ultimate moral choice (personal desire vs. greater good) follows a somewhat predictable arc. The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly in explaining the grandmother's legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates diverse elements into a cohesive narrative about time, loss, and responsibility. The planetarium/nightclub setting and button box mechanics feel organic rather than forced. While the brevity works well, the final ethical decision could benefit from more nuanced exploration. Nevertheless, the story leaves readers with a lingering meditation on sacrifice and duty that transcends its specific fantastical premise.</comment>
