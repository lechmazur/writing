<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus Chen is well-realized as a social media exorcist with a distinct professional detachment. His character motivation is consistent and revealed through his actions. The "indifferent enthusiasm" comes through clearly in his practiced approach. However, the character could benefit from more personal stakes or a deeper exploration of why he chooses this unusual profession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent despite the brief format. The grocery receipt serves as an effective plot device that connects the beginning to the twist ending. The story moves logically from investigation to revelation with clear cause-effect relationships. The subversion of expectations—that Marcus was actually hired by the sister herself—creates a satisfying arc that challenges the initial premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building excels with atmospheric details that enhance the story's themes. The abandoned mess hall with "peeling walls echoing with the memory of ten thousand forgotten meals" and fluorescent lights "stuttering like dying stars" creates a potent backdrop for digital ghosts. The secret clubs with faces "glowing blue from burner phones" effectively establishes a liminal space between digital existence and disappearance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates considerable craft with its exploration of digital identity and chosen invisibility. The central metaphor of exorcism for digital erasure is compelling and consistently developed. The final line about "letting the ghost choose its own haunting" provides a resonant conclusion that elevates the narrative beyond its surface plot. The story effectively shows rather than tells, particularly in the revelation scene where understanding passes between characters without exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story displays originality in its concept of "social media exorcism" and avoids most AI-writing pitfalls. The metaphors are fresh and specific to the digital world ("influencers into echoes"). However, there are moments of slightly purple prose ("feeding his curiosity with life's raw edge") and some descriptions that verge on being overly formal. The handling of the twist avoids predictability, though the premise itself draws on familiar digital-age anxieties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The narrative leaves readers with thought-provoking questions about digital identity, visibility, and the power of choosing one's own disappearance. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a concentrated experience that suggests depths beyond what's explicitly stated. With minor refinements to tone consistency and some phrasing, this could be ready for publication.</comment>
