<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The characters of Marcus and the engineer are well-drawn with clear motivations. Marcus's "bluffing" nature is effectively shown through his "practiced performance" and deliberate posturing. The woman's internal conflict is palpable. Their interactions reveal depth, though the brief format limits full development. The "energetically lethargic" attribute is cleverly integrated into both characters' physical movements as a reflection of their psychological states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably coherent for the word limit. The dropped book as meet-cute device is elegantly executed and subverted when acknowledged as a setup. The narrative creates a complete arc from Marcus's waiting to the revelation of truth, with the computer restart marking a perfect turning point. Cause-effect relationships are logical, and the pacing effectively builds tension without feeling rushed or underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard inside a fallen skyscraper creates a breathtaking juxtaposition of nature reclaiming corporate failure. Sensory details are exceptional—sunlight through shattered glass, apple blossoms trembling, the startup chime echoing through the vertical orchard. The atmosphere of beauty amid destruction perfectly complements the theme of exposing truth in a corrupted system. The setting functions as both literal space and powerful metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional and intellectual impact through its layered symbolism (the price tag representing "what can't be bought—truth") and the Eden imagery amid corporate ruins. The central conflict of exposing corporate malfeasance is effectively established and resolved through the engineer's surrender of evidence. The dialogue is sparse but meaningful, and the ending creates a sense of justice about to unfold. The story skillfully shows rather than tells emotional states.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates considerable originality in its concept and execution. The oxymoronic phrase "energetically lethargic" is particularly effective. While some metaphors ("pages fluttering like dying moths") approach purple prose, they generally serve the atmospheric intent. The story avoids most AI-writing patterns, though the engineer's immediate recognition of Marcus feels slightly convenient. The emotional nuance is generally well-handled through specific physical details rather than stated emotions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion. The orchard-in-skyscraper setting, the blank price tag as symbol, and the "gentle harshness" tone all serve the central theme of exposing corporate corruption. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, and the story leaves readers with the lingering question of what justice will follow. The characters' parallel journeys from deception to truth create thematic resonance that elevates the narrative beyond its plot elements.</comment>
