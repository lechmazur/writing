<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's softhearted nature is clearly established and effectively tied to both her past (sparing opponents in fighting rings) and present actions (carefully unraveling fate). Her motivation to restore free will feels authentic, though her emotional journey could be more nuanced. The grandfather connection adds depth, but we could use more internal conflict to fully understand the risks she's taking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from discovery to action to resolution with Maya's stabilizing work driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, with clear cause-effect relationships between her midnight visits and the gradual restoration of free will. The final stabilization creates a strong climactic moment that pays off the setup effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyberpunk city contrasted with the analog planetarium creates compelling tension. The copper dome's "consistently organic dead zone" is cleverly integrated as both plot device and thematic element. Sensory details like "neon-washed evidence room" and the projection of probability maps effectively build the atmosphere. The juxtaposition between algorithmic control and astronomical freedom is particularly well-rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The metaphor of unraveling fate like a grandmother's sweater is elegant and resonant. The story effectively explores themes of determinism versus free will, and technology versus humanity. While emotional impact is strong, dialogue is absent, which limits character dynamism. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution while suggesting broader societal change, though it could delve deeper into the implications of Maya's actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story avoids many AI writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and focused narrative. However, phrases like "muted euphoria" feel somewhat generic, and the emotional development relies more on telling than showing. While the premise is inventive, the execution follows somewhat predictable patterns of resistance narratives. The writing demonstrates creativity but occasionally slips into formulaic expressions of emotion and conflict resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The cyberpunk setting and the planetarium function as effective counterpoints that enhance the thematic exploration of technological control versus human agency. While some emotional nuances could be deeper, the story leaves readers with thought-provoking questions about determinism and the power of narrative in shaping reality.</comment>
