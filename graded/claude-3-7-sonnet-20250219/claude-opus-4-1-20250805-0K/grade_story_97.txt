<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera's transformation from a fact-minded oracle to someone who understands emotional truth is well-executed. Her motivation shifts convincingly as she discovers that heartbreak grants dimensional insight. The "desperately casual indifference" effectively reveals her struggle to maintain composure. However, we could benefit from more specific details about her pre-heartbreak prophecies to better appreciate her evolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from Vera's heartbreak to her discovery of new oracular abilities, creating a satisfying arc within the constraint. The brass compass serves as an effective plot device that mirrors her internal journey. The pacing expertly balances exposition and action, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between heartbreak and dimensional sight is conceptually strong and drives the narrative forward with clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly rendered with specific, evocative detailsâ€”"like a dying fluorescent bulb," "crystallized tears hanging in space," abandoned libraries and ghost-gardens. The setting directly embodies Vera's emotional state while serving the plot. The atmosphere perfectly balances cosmic wonder with personal grief. Time manipulation in "the cradle of a whispered minute" beautifully connects setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the theme that truth requires emotional understanding, not just facts. The compass metaphor works brilliantly, transforming from wildly spinning to "pulsing like a heart learning to recompose itself." The contrast between Vera's former certainty and new understanding creates compelling tension. The ending delivers emotional satisfaction as she embraces her transformed abilities. The story excels at showing rather than telling her emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids common AI pitfalls with fresh metaphors and consistent characterization. Phrases like "particular shade of optimistic desperation" demonstrate linguistic creativity. However, certain moments like "the unstable dimension shimmered approval" edge toward anthropomorphizing in a slightly predictable way. The conference room of "universe's architects" borders on familiar cosmic tropes. Otherwise, the narrative maintains a distinctive voice and avoids formulaic emotional descriptions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates all required elements while maintaining narrative coherence and emotional resonance. The brass compass, unstable dimension, and heartbreak-induced visions feel essential rather than forced. The exploration of how emotional pain leads to deeper understanding provides thematic depth within the tight word count. The writing balances lyrical and straightforward prose effectively, creating a story that lingers with the reader.</comment>
