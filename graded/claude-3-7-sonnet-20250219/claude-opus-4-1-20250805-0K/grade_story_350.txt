<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dimitri's character is established through his puppeteer background and connection to his mother's legacy, showing clear motivation to uncover truth. However, his emotional development feels somewhat static—we're told he understands his "inherited purpose" rather than shown his internal struggle or transformation. His reactions lack nuance; he moves from discovery to acceptance too smoothly for someone confronting family secrets.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear beginning, middle, and end within the constraints, with the discovery of the dress leading logically to the album and then to Dimitri's new purpose. The integration of puzzle-solving, puppet metaphors, and revolution creates a coherent throughline. However, the revolution backstory feels rushed and underdeveloped—we're told about the mother's significance rather than experiencing its revelation organically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient Greek temple setting is rendered with evocative details like "moonlight pooled through collapsed ceiling stones" and "broken columns cast shadows like giant marionettes." The atmosphere of secrecy and history effectively complements the uncovering of hidden truth, creating a resonant connection between past and present that enhances the puppetry motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The puppetry metaphor works well throughout ("The temple's broken columns cast shadows like giant marionettes"), providing thematic coherence. However, the story relies too heavily on telling rather than showing, especially regarding the mother's revolution. The emotional impact is diluted by explanatory passages rather than allowing readers to experience revelations alongside Dimitri. The ending feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from overly formal language ("In this moment of alone intimacy with his mother's ghost") and explanation-heavy passages that feel mechanical. The revolution backstory is presented too neatly, lacking the messiness of authentic human experience. While the puppetry motif shows creativity, the character's reactions follow predictable patterns without the contradictions or complexities of genuine human emotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates all required elements into a cohesive narrative about inheritance and revolution. The puppetry metaphor provides thematic unity, but the prose often prioritizes explaining connections rather than allowing them to emerge naturally. While the concept is intriguing, the execution lacks the subtlety and emotional nuance required for truly distinguished literary fiction.</comment>
