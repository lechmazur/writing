<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lady Constance is portrayed effectively as a broke aristocrat carrying her family's peculiar burden. Her motivations are clear and consistent—she seeks the alchemical recipes to escape poverty. Her actions (selling her car for bread, climbing the coaster despite her fine dress) reveal her desperation and determination. However, her character lacks some psychological depth; we see her actions but have limited insight into her emotional complexity beyond basic necessity and duty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with logical cause-effect relationships—Constance follows the botanical map to retrieve ancestral recipes. The harmonizing action drives the plot forward organically. While the beginning and end connect well, the middle section feels somewhat rushed, particularly the transition from climbing the tracks to suddenly receiving recipes through sensory impressions. The supernatural elements, while intriguing, aren't fully explained within the constraints, leaving some logical gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is exceptional—vividly realized with rusted gates, skeletal tracks, and rotting wood. The atmosphere of decay perfectly contrasts with the magical potential of the recipes. Sensory details like the illustration glowing, air thickening, and the groaning coaster create an immersive experience. The parallel tracks brilliantly embody the timeframe concept, physically representing the story's themes of past and present colliding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses rich imagery and symbolism—particularly the parallel tracks representing different timelines and the crumbling illustration signifying completed purpose. The theme of preserving valuable knowledge versus hoarding it for personal gain is compelling. The ending satisfies by resolving Constance's immediate quest while opening possibilities for her future. The "blurry vividness" tone works well, though the story occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states and motivations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, there are moments of overly formal language and some generic phrasing ("the burden wasn't the poverty or the shame"). The "recipes entering her mind not as words but as sensations" feels somewhat formulaic in execution. However, the concept of alchemical cooking formulas hidden in an abandoned park is genuinely innovative, and the sensory details of the park are specific rather than generic. The emotional resonance remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully incorporates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an original premise. The elements of aristocratic decline, haunted park, and secret recipes blend naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity works reasonably well, though some transitions feel rushed. The story leaves readers with intriguing questions about what Constance will do with the recipes and how they might "harmonize sustenance with wonder." Some deeper character development would elevate it further.</comment>
