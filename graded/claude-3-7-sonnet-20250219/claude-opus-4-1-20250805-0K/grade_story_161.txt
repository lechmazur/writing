<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization as a vigilant orchardist turned conspiracy theorist works effectively. His punctuality is well-integrated as both a coping mechanism and strategic advantage. The connection between his past life (catching falling fruit) and present skills is particularly strong. However, his emotional transition from grief to triumph feels slightly rushed in the limited space, preventing a truly profound character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively weaves the conspiracy discovery and demonstration into a coherent narrative. The peacock pattern as communication system creates a logical throughline. However, the resolution happens too abruptlyâ€”the immediate success of Marcus's plan and the facility's dramatic reaction to his paper airplane strains credibility. The story would benefit from a more nuanced climax that acknowledges potential resistance to his revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a unique backdrop that cleverly parallels the protagonist's journey (flight, design patterns, hidden purposes). The atmosphere balances technical setting with emotional stakes. Some sensory details work well ("smile sharp as broken glass"), but the physical space lacks sufficient concrete detail to fully immerse readers in this specialized environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock metaphor throughout, creating thematic resonance between Sarah's gift and the conspiracy. The final line about truth "blooming" connects nicely to Marcus's orchardist background. However, the emotional impact is undermined by the too-neat resolution and on-the-nose dialogue ("the smallest seed can topple the mightiest tree"). The conflict resolves with insufficient complexity for a truly satisfying payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the peacock pattern concept shows originality, the execution falls into conspiracy thriller tropes: the evil director with the "sharp smile," the convenient triggering of alarms, and the dramatic villain confrontation. The dialogue during the climax ("You killed her") lacks subtlety. The orchardist background offers fresh perspective, but the conspiracy itself follows predictable patterns without subverting genre expectations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with reasonable coherence, particularly in connecting the orchardist background to both character traits and the resolution. The peacock motif provides a unifying thread. However, the rapid shift from investigation to complete triumph undermines believability, and some dialogue feels artificial rather than organic. The story has a compelling premise but would benefit from more nuanced execution in its limited space.</comment>
