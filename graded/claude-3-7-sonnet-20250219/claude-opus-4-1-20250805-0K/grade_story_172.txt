<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's character as an unsettled guide is well-established and her motivation is clear. Her transformation from sensing something wrong to becoming accidentally heroic feels organic. However, her internal conflict could be more deeply explored, and her personality lacks some distinguishing traits beyond her role in the plot. The reversed wishes concept effectively shapes her actions, but her emotional journey feels somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end despite the word constraint. The concept of architectural secrets drives the narrative effectively, and the action of aligning connects well with both the puzzle box and the larger conspiracy. However, the leap from museum guide to potential city-savior feels rushed, and some cause-effect relationships would benefit from more development. The pacing accelerates too quickly in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The giant seashell setting creates a unique, evocative atmosphere that contrasts well with the architectural focus. The shell's natural acoustics and phosphorescent patterns provide strong sensory details that enhance the mood of revelation and ancient wisdom. The connection between the shell, the puzzle box, and the architectural blueprints is inventive, though the transition from museum to beach lacks some contextual grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively employs symbolism (the shell as protector/revealer, the puzzle box as key to understanding) and creates tension through the countdown element. The theme of truth emerging from deception resonates, and the ending provides a satisfying resolution. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by exposition-heavy passages, and the deeper implications of the conspiracy could be more subtly integrated rather than directly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids most common tropes and creates a unique scenario, some descriptions lean toward purple prose ("sharp gentleness," "phosphorescent patterns"). The reversed wishes concept offers originality, but the narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The writing maintains consistent tone but could benefit from more distinctive stylistic choices and fewer explanatory passages that diminish the mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The concept of architectural secrets linked to tectonic destruction creates genuine stakes, and the reversed wishes mechanism adds complexity. However, the exposition sometimes overwhelms the action, and certain transitions feel compressed. The story establishes an interesting world but could allow more room for reader interpretation rather than explaining all connections.</comment>
