<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is well-developed with clear motivation and consistent traits. Her "angrily peaceful" state manifests naturally in her focused determination. Her background as a prodigy connects logically to her current mission. The introduction of the younger girl creates an effective mirror, though their relationship could be developed with more nuance. The character's voice maintains a distinctive quality throughout, particularly in how she approaches her secretive work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from Mira's routine to the discovery of the note to meeting her successor. Despite the word constraints, the story achieves a satisfying arc with clear beginning, middle, and end. The use of marathon training as a timeframe effectively structures the narrative progression. The cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The incorporation of the hacking method is integrated naturally into the plot rather than feeling forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned amusement park setting is exceptionally well-utilized, with the ghost train serving as both metaphor and practical element of the plot. Sensory details like "the ghost train's tunnel exhaled cold air" create vivid atmosphere. The contrast between the decaying park and the vital preservation work enhances thematic resonance. The setting works in harmony with the secretive nature of the protagonist's work, creating a compelling atmosphere of forgotten places holding important secrets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of preservation, mentorship, and resistance against corporate power. The ghost train and encrypted music create meaningful symbolism. The emotional resonance builds subtly to the final image of two shadows running together. While the conflict and stakes are clear, the resolution could benefit from slightly more development. The metaphor of repairing the teapot with gold lacquer elegantly represents the healing of generational wounds and continuation of important knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, avoiding obvious tropes. The character's emotions are shown rather than told, particularly in moments of tension. Some phrases like "fury crystallized into focused calm" demonstrate fresh imagery. However, certain elements like the corporate antagonists remain somewhat generic, and the emotional arc follows a predictable pattern of isolation to connection. The writing maintains a consistent tone and demonstrates individual style, though occasional phrases like "discarded humanity" veer toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative that feels natural rather than forced. The brief length works to its advantage, creating a focused snapshot of an intriguing world. The ending leaves the reader with lingering questions about the future of this preservation network. The core concept of forgotten knowledge being preserved through unconventional means is compelling and developed effectively within the constraints. The story demonstrates creative thinking in how disparate elements (music playlists, botany, cryptography) are woven together.</comment>
