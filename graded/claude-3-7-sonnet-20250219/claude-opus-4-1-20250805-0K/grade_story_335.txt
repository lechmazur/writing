<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Raven's characterization as a shaky mercenary is handled with subtlety and depth. Her physical tremor becomes a powerful metaphor for her psychological state. The dialogue reveals her motivation organically, and her decision to leave the amber behind shows meaningful character growth. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into specific events that shaped her mercenary past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Raven's search with her inner journey of finalization. The structure moves effectively from seeking external healing to discovering internal resolution. The arc is complete within the tight word count, with the amber serving as both catalyst and symbol of transformation. The only slight weakness is that the healer's insight comes somewhat easily, without much resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral transformed into an artist's haven creates a powerfully symbolic setting that mirrors Raven's own transformation. The sensory details are exceptional—spray paint "hissing like prophecy," twilight stretching shadows through "skeletal arches," and the cathedral that "breathed with aerosol art." The atmosphere perfectly balances decay with renewal, mirroring the character's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional impact through its metaphorical depth. The trapped spider as a mirror for Raven's suspended rage is brilliant, and the transformation of the amber's weight provides tangible evidence of her emotional shift. The dialogue is sparse but profound. The central theme of finding redemption by confronting the past rather than running from it emerges organically from the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates authentic craftsmanship with fresh, specific metaphors ("hands shook with possibility instead of memory") and avoids clichés in its treatment of redemption. The language is evocative without becoming purple prose. The only minor weakness is occasional overreliance on abstraction ("painted redemption in unlikely colors") where more concrete detail might strengthen authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story succeeds admirably in integrating its assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The amber with its trapped spider becomes both plot device and central metaphor, while the cathedral setting provides the perfect symbolic backdrop for transformation. The tight word count feels deliberate rather than limiting, and the story leaves readers with lingering questions about redemption and identity that extend beyond the narrative.</comment>
