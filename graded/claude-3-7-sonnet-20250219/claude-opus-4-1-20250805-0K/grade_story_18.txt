<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lady Meridian's character is well-developed within the constraints, displaying clear motivation to expose truth. Her telepathic abilities and statue nature create an intriguing juxtaposition, though her inner conflict could be more deeply explored. The child character serves effectively as a catalyst but remains somewhat underdeveloped. Lady Meridian's voice is distinctive, particularly in her physical movements described as "bronze joints screaming protest" and her telepathic communication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Lady Meridian's observation of corruption to her decisive action when presented with the child's loss. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The narrative arc feels complete—from statue's passive observation to active intervention and back to monumenthood with new purpose. The weatherizing element is cleverly integrated as both plot point and metaphor for attempted containment of truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The steampunk setting is richly evoked through specific details like "steam carriages," "Cogwheel Square," and "ornamental pipes." The atmosphere brilliantly complements the story's themes—industrial aesthetics mirror mechanical concealment of human tragedy. Sensory details are exceptional: bronze feet ringing "against cobblestones like funeral bells played in major key" perfectly embodies the tragically joyful tone while grounding readers in the physical world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves powerful emotional resonance through its exploration of truth versus power. The central metaphor of a statue—meant to commemorate but actually concealing—works brilliantly as social commentary. The story effectively "shows" through sensory detail and action rather than telling. The ending strikes a delicate balance between resolution and lingering impact, suggesting both justice and the fragility of truth. The phrase "tragically joyful sensation of being right about humanity's capacity for deception" encapsulates the thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its premise and execution. The living statue concept avoids cliché through specific, unexpected details like "verdigris skin" and telepathy that "could slip into minds like water through cracks." The emotional nuance of being vindicated about corruption is handled with sophistication. Occasionally, phrases like "blazed the light of recognition" veer toward formulaic territory, but these moments are counterbalanced by fresh imagery like "promises were ink on water, pretty but meaningless."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>This story succeeds in weaving multiple assigned elements into a cohesive, meaningful narrative that transcends its constraints. The steampunk setting, telepathic statue, and themes of truth and power complement each other organically rather than feeling forced. The brevity works to the story's advantage, creating a focused intensity. While a few passages could benefit from tighter editing, the overall execution demonstrates impressive craft, with a lingering emotional and intellectual impact that extends well beyond the final sentence.</comment>
