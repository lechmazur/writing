<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's character is effectively developed through her uniquely literal interpretation trait, which drives her success where others failed. Her motivation is clear and consistent—she takes ghostly communications at face value to solve humanity's water crisis. However, we get limited insight into her emotional landscape beyond her methodical approach, and her backstory remains mostly unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Maya's discovery to revelation, with the overcharging switchboard effectively propelling the narrative forward. The parsing of notes slipped under doors provides a coherent method for her progress. Despite the brevity, the story achieves a complete arc with meaningful stakes (humanity's salvation). The cosmic telephone concept is inventively integrated with the water crisis backdrop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement is masterfully rendered with sensory details that defy the drought above—weeping walls, ghostly whispers, temperature drops, and frost. The post-water wars setting creates meaningful tension with the basement's impossible moisture. The atmosphere of spectral energy and phantom electricity perfectly supports both the supernatural elements and Maya's practical approach to communication with the dead.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story effectively transforms mundane objects (phone booth key, switchboard) into cosmic tools, creating layers of meaning. The narrative shows rather than tells Maya's methodical nature through her actions. The central conflict—humanity's water crisis—provides clear stakes. The cosmic telephone metaphor works brilliantly, suggesting communication across dimensions. The ending delivers satisfaction while implying far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of post-apocalyptic and supernatural elements, avoiding predictable ghost story tropes. The central conceit—ghosts operating cosmic telephone lines—feels fresh. While some descriptions occasionally border on purple prose ("brazen calm"), most sensory details are specific and purposeful. The narrative maintains consistent tone throughout. The emotional landscape could use more nuance and less reliance on stated feelings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating an evocative glimpse into a larger world without overexplaining. The cosmic telephone concept leaves lingering questions about humanity's future that extend beyond the narrative. While ambitious in scope, the execution largely succeeds in creating a memorable, thought-provoking piece that balances speculative elements with human motivation.</comment>
