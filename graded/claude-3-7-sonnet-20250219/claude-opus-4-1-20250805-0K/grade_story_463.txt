<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's dry wit manifests naturally in his dialogue and internal observations ("the smell rather fitting"). His motivation to complete the ritual is revealed gradually and feels authentic. His connection to his grandmother adds depth and justifies his knowledge of the Mariner's Waltz. While we learn much about him through action rather than exposition, his character could benefit from slightly more complexity in his initial reactions to the spirits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from discovery to confrontation to resolution with impressive efficiency. The confiscation transforms beautifully from a presumed seizure of evidence into something more profound. The story achieves a complete arc despite constraints, with the ritual dance serving as both climax and resolution. Causality is clear throughout, and the pacing maintains tension while allowing for necessary revelations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered through sensory details that evoke both physical and supernatural elements ("reeked of salt and broken oaths," "floorboards groaned like promises"). The atmosphere perfectly complements the core concept of eroding promises, with the lighthouse—a symbol of guidance—becoming a site of dangerous ritual. The setting feels integral rather than incidental to the story's meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its extended metaphor of erosion and letting go. Dialogue is sparse but impactful. The ending delivers a profound thematic statement that recontextualizes the entire narrative. The conflict between preservation and release is deftly handled. Literary devices, particularly the rope as symbol and the lighthouse as metaphor, are sophisticated without being heavy-handed. The story shows rather than tells its emotional content through action and imagery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its supernatural framework and fresh metaphors ("her voice carrying the weight of a hundred broken promises"). While the lighthouse ghost trope isn't new, the specific ritual and its meaning feel inventive. Some phrases ("calculated chaos," "reckless precision") verge on contradictory in a way that feels slightly manufactured. However, the narrative maintains consistent tone and the emotional progression feels genuine rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its component parts. The frayed rope becomes a central metaphor that ties together character, setting, and theme. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each word serving multiple purposes. The story achieves literary weight through its thematic exploration of letting go versus holding on, leaving readers with a philosophical question that lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
