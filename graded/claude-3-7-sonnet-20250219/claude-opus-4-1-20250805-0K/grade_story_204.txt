<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession as a cuddler effectively intertwines with her internal conflict about physical contact, creating a character whose motivation is psychologically consistent. Her grandmother's warning creates meaningful tension in her professional life. However, her internal transformation feels somewhat hastened and told rather than shown, and we lack deeper insight into how this prejudice has specifically affected her practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects Mira's professional conflict with the mystical resolution at the hangar, creating a satisfying arc. The ticket punch serves as an elegant plot device that bridges the physical and metaphorical journeys. However, the transition from the farmer's market vendor to the spiritual revelation at the hangar feels somewhat abrupt, and the climactic moment when the punch begins working on its own could benefit from more narrative tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar creates a powerful atmosphere that resonates with the themes of connection and isolation. Sensory details like "rust and old fuel" and the description of shadows "like ancient cathedral bones" effectively establish both physical setting and emotional landscape. The juxtaposition of a cuddler in this industrial, abandoned space creates meaningful contrast that enhances the story's meditation on human connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story creates substantial impact through its exploration of human connection as a form of cosmic travel. Strong metaphorical language ("comfort given freely travels farther than any rocket") and the symbolism of the ticket punch as a validator of emotional journeys demonstrate sophisticated craft. The resolution offers genuine emotional catharsis, though some metaphors occasionally drift toward abstraction that slightly dilutes their power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the premise of a professional cuddler with a magical ticket punch is original, certain phrases like "her grandmother's words still haunted her professional embraces" and "holding space for light in its absence" feel somewhat formulaic. The binary stars metaphor and some of the abstractions about human connection occasionally border on new-age clich√©. The writing shows distinct style but occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than fully embodying them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive cohesion between disparate elements, particularly in linking the spaceport setting with the theme of human connection as travel. The professional cuddler character and phantom ticket punch create a distinctive conceptual framework. While occasionally veering into abstract language that diminishes immediacy, the story largely succeeds in creating a meaningful meditation on physical contact and emotional validation within its constraints.</comment>
