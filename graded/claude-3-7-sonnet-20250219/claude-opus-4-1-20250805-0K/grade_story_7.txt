<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building creates a vivid pre-divine reality. The facility with its amber pools, crystalline pipes, and constellation-mapped ceiling feels tangibly alien yet comprehensible. Sensory details of nectar, honeyed substance, and ethereal communication create a richly immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves profound thematic depth by exploring the transition from raw divinity to structured religion.
