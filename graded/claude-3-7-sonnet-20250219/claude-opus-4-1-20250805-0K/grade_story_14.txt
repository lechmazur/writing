<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's naivety is well-established and consistent with his actions. His terminal diagnosis provides clear motivation for his desperate gambling. The character transformation from naive gambler to someone who understands the true nature of the bargain is compelling. However, his inner voice could be more distinctive, and the emotional transition feels slightly rushed at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably coherent within the tight word limit. The gambling action drives the narrative forward naturally, with the concept of unspoken bargains forming the backbone of the story. The arc from Marcus's desperate wager to his transformation creates a complete narrative. The revelation about the true nature of the station and the price of winning is particularly effective as a resolution that recontextualizes earlier events.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal power monitoring station creates a uniquely atmospheric setting that metaphorically reinforces the story's themes of ebb and flow, life and death. The candlelit dinners amid electronic monitors creates a compelling visual contrast. Sensory details are precise and evocative—flickering screens like "electronic prayers," laughter that comes out "wet," and shadows dancing against monitors that "pulse with heartbeats"—all contributing to the uncanny atmosphere where technology and human desperation intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional and intellectual depth. The central metaphor of gambling with life itself is powerfully executed. The subtext about the cost of survival and the nature of bargains runs throughout. The professor's condition serves as both foreshadowing and thematic reinforcement. The ending delivers a haunting impact, with Marcus's transformation into someone who will "never stop laughing at the sorrow of it all" lingering beyond the final sentence. The story effectively shows rather than tells its emotional beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in its concept and execution. The metaphors are fresh—particularly the tidal imagery that connects to both the setting and the emotional undercurrents. The emotional complexity of the "laughter-tears" is handled with nuance rather than stated directly. There are occasional moments where the language becomes slightly overwrought ("electronic prayers"), but these are balanced by genuinely inventive phrasing. The story avoids predictable patterns and creates a unique atmosphere that feels authentic rather than formulaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>This story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The brevity feels purposeful rather than constraining, with each element contributing meaningfully to the narrative and thematic resonance. The combination of gambling, terminal illness, and supernatural bargains creates something fresh rather than derivative. The lingering impact of the ending—a man who has gained life but lost the ability to experience it normally—demonstrates significant depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
