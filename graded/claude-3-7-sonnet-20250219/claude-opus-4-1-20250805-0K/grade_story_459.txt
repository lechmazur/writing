<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-developed through her "elegantly clumsy" movements that mirror the ghost scientist. Her motivation to understand the silence and ultimately help the ghost find release feels authentic. Her ability to see what others miss—both literally (ghosts) and metaphorically (the truth about letting go)—creates a consistent characterization. However, her initial motivation for staking out ghost tours feels somewhat underdeveloped, and her expertise in both elevator repair and understanding spirits lacks some explanation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from Marina's encounters with the ghost to her realization about letting go. The parallel between preserving sand castles and the ghost's inability to move on creates thematic coherence. The resolution feels earned through the gradual building of connection between Marina and the ghost. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with a clear beginning, middle, and satisfying resolution that ties directly to the central theme.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is brilliantly conceived, creating a metaphorically rich setting that directly enhances the theme of impermanence versus preservation. The "dissonance of silence" is rendered tangible through sensory details like the pressure against eardrums and aching teeth. The juxtaposition of sterile laboratory spaces with the supernatural creates tension, while the elevator shaft provides both literal and metaphorical liminality—a perfect in-between space for encountering spirits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves significant emotional impact through its exploration of impermanence and the beauty of endings. The metaphor of sand castles preserved mid-collapse brilliantly parallels the ghost's state. The final line about "liberation lived not in holding on, but in the grace of letting go" crystallizes the theme without feeling heavy-handed. The story skillfully shows Marina's growing understanding through her interactions rather than stating it explicitly. The resolution feels both emotionally satisfying and intellectually stimulating.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central metaphor of preserved sand castles and its approach to ghost stories. The writing avoids purple prose while maintaining evocative imagery. However, phrases like "with characteristic elegance" and "with sudden clarity" verge on telling rather than showing. The ghost's story revealed "in fragments" could benefit from more specific details rather than summary. The liberation theme, while beautifully executed, follows a somewhat predictable arc of helping spirits "move on" that's common in ghost stories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, with each component serving the central theme of preservation versus release. The emotional resonance is genuine, built through carefully constructed parallels between Marina, the ghost, and the sand castles. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with no wasted words. The philosophical exploration of impermanence's beauty elevates this beyond a simple ghost story into a meditation on how we relate to loss and change.</comment>
