<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya demonstrates clear motivation as a rebel preserving building traditions, though her character lacks deeper dimensions beyond this singular drive. Her "bitterness braided through determination" provides some nuance, but she remains somewhat archetypal. Secondary character Thomas offers a glimpse of personal loss that enriches the rebellion's foundation, but the twelve apprentices remain undeveloped background elements.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively builds from discovery (the note) to gathering rebels to making a pact, creating a complete arc despite brevity. The act of theorizing drives forward understanding of the note's purpose. The story achieves coherence by framing events between storms—both literal weather and metaphorical upheaval. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and predictable with the note conveniently dissolving once its purpose is fulfilled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage creates a remarkably effective atmosphere that enhances both the rebellion's secrecy and the preservation of tradition. Sensory details are vivid—walls that "breathe with accumulated secrets," cold spots drifting "like searching fingers," and the thunder announcing the approaching storm. The setting becomes a character itself, with the ghosts transforming from potential threats to allies, mirroring the rebels' journey from fear to determination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the architecture metaphor throughout, building thematic resonance between physical structures and cultural preservation. The note's transformation for each reader cleverly reinforces the theme of personalized knowledge. However, the story relies too heavily on telling emotional states rather than showing them through action, and the dialogue occasionally veers into exposition rather than revealing character. The conclusion offers a satisfying thematic resolution but lacks surprise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of architectural traditions being preserved against authoritarian control feels fresh, the story follows somewhat predictable revolutionary narrative patterns. The "ghosts as guardians" twist is telegraphed rather than surprising. Language occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate ("bitterness sharpening her words"). The note dissolving into ash once its purpose is fulfilled is a convenient, somewhat clichéd plot device. The emotion is stated rather than fully embodied through specific character reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about preservation and rebellion. The architectural focus provides specificity that elevates the concept beyond generic dystopian rebellion tropes. The haunted passage and changing note create intriguing speculative elements that enhance rather than distract from the core theme. While the story hints at deeper world-building, it doesn't fully explore the complexities of the Council's ban or the specific architectural knowledge being preserved.</comment>
