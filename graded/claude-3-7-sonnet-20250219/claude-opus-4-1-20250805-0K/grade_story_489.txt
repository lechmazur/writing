<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya is thoughtfully rendered with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her connection to ancestral knowledge and calm determination in the face of supernatural elements reveals significant depth. Her relationship with her grandmother adds meaningful dimension. However, we could benefit from more insight into Maya's internal conflicts or hesitations to elevate her from an effective vessel for tradition to a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot builds elegantly from setup to climax to resolution, with the dance ritual as an effective narrative engine. The connection between the lighthouse keeper's fate and Maya's mission creates excellent narrative tension. The story achieves a complete arc despite the word constraint, with Maya's successful communion with the whales providing satisfying resolution. The pacing expertly balances exposition with action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exquisitely rendered, functioning as both physical space and metaphysical threshold. The atmosphere of ancient wisdom colliding with modernity creates palpable tension. The sensory details—particularly the transformation of whale songs penetrating stone walls "as if they were membrane"—are vivid and transportive. The setting and timeframe work in perfect harmony to create a liminal space where the supernatural feels entirely plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its themes of cultural preservation and communion between species. The imagery is consistently striking—particularly the dance as "a language predating human speech" and the lighthouse exhaling through Maya. The story skillfully employs subtext about cultural erasure and environmental disconnection without being didactic. The ending leaves readers with both resolution and mystery, a difficult balance expertly achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its premise and execution. The juxtaposition of the plastic whistle with ancient ritual creates compelling tension. However, certain phrases like "aggressively kind insistence" and "brazen calm" feel somewhat contrived rather than organic to the narrative. The writing occasionally edges toward purple prose ("the years of forgetting, the decades of shame"), which slightly diminishes authenticity. Still, the core narrative voice maintains consistency and the emotional landscape feels genuine rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This is a remarkably cohesive and evocative story that skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a meaningful whole. The narrative demonstrates sophisticated control of atmosphere and theme within tight constraints. While occasional moments of overwrought language prevent it from reaching the highest echelon of literary accomplishment, the story succeeds in creating a memorable, emotionally resonant experience that lingers beyond its conclusion. The balance of concrete detail with mystical elements is particularly effective.</comment>
