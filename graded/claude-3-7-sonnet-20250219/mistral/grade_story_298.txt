<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wei's character shows promise with the "rationally impulsive" trait driving his unconventional methods, but his personality lacks depth beyond his artistic mission. His motivation to "weave emotional honesty into illusions" is clear but remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant. The character feels more like a vehicle for the story's themes than a fully realized individual with personal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot structure connects Wei's investigation of the princess's disappearance to his theatrical ambitions, but the arc feels incomplete. The story establishes a compelling premise but doesn't deliver a satisfying progression or resolution. The cold-case mystery method drives the narrative forward, but the connection between solving the mystery and creating art remains underdeveloped within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The post-oil Chinese palace creates a distinctive atmosphere that effectively blends decay and former grandeur. The "sunlight through debris" concept is well-integrated as both literal description and metaphor. The setting powerfully embodies the story's themes of past and present colliding, though some sensory details feel generic rather than specific to this unique environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the tattered dress, filtered sunlight) and creates thematic resonance between personal and societal loss. However, it relies too heavily on telling rather than showing Wei's artistic process and emotional journey. The ending promises transformation but doesn't deliver a concrete payoff, leaving the story's impact more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The writing suffers from overly formal phrasing ("a place where past and present collided") and abstract descriptions that create distance rather than immediacy. Emotional states are often stated rather than demonstrated through action. The prose tends toward purple at times ("the dust of history settled like a second skin"), and the narrative voice lacks distinctive personality, reading more like an outline for a story than the story itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with moderate success, creating a coherent premise about art, history, and societal decay. However, it prioritizes thematic connections over character development and concrete action. The brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, as the story introduces compelling ideas but doesn't fully explore or resolve them, leaving the reader with intriguing concepts rather than emotional satisfaction.</comment>
