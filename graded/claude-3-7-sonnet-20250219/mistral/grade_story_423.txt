<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ser Alistair's earnestness is stated but not demonstrated through meaningful choices or internal conflict. His motivation is clear but lacks personal stakes or emotional depth. The character remains largely a vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized individual with distinctive traits or voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the knight discovering the connection between the map and greenhouse tears, but the resolution feels rushed and too easily achieved. The cause-effect relationship between mapping tears and triggering environmental change lacks sufficient explanation, leaving logical gaps in an otherwise coherent structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined aqueduct and greenhouse in an arid desert create a vivid post-apocalyptic atmosphere that effectively contrasts with the knight's ice-melting mission. Strong visual imagery of sun-bleached stone against sand and light streaming through broken glass establishes a compelling sense of desolation and forgotten grandeur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (stars, constellations, light) to connect celestial patterns with earthly redemption, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing emotional impact. The central conflict lacks sufficient obstacles, and the resolution comes too easily without meaningful struggle, diminishing the story's dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from overreliance on adjectives ("harsh sunlight," "ethereal light") and abstract concepts rather than specific, concrete details. The knight's quest follows predictable fantasy tropes without subversion. Emotional resonance is stated rather than earned through character development, and the metaphorical connections between stars and tears feel more algorithmic than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the story successfully incorporates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative, it prioritizes concept over character depth. The prose alternates between evocative imagery and generic description. The environmental transformation lacks sufficient buildup to feel earned, though the central metaphor of celestial patterns mirrored in earthly structures shows creative potential.</comment>
