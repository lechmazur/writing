<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Edgar's character has clear motivation through his brother's disappearance, and his orderly nature as an orchardist contrasts effectively with his growing obsession. However, the "sardonic glee" feels underdeveloped and his emotional journey lacks sufficient nuance. The transition from vigilant orchardist to conspiracy theorist happens too abruptly without showing the psychological progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the discovery of the seal leading to resolution about Henry, but suffers from rushed pacing in the final third. The connection between peacock patterns and the brother's disappearance remains underdeveloped, with the resolution feeling too convenient. The "map" revelation lacks sufficient setup, making the climactic discovery feel unearned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates a distinctive, quirky atmosphere that effectively supports the conspiracy theme. The contrast between the ordered orchard and chaotic investigation creates meaningful tension. However, sensory details are sparse, particularly in describing the facility itself, which limits immersion in what could be a more vividly realized setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The peacock motif functions as an effective symbol throughout, creating thematic coherence. However, the emotional impact is diminished by telling rather than showing Edgar's internal state. The story raises intriguing questions about obsession and closure but doesn't fully explore them. The ending resolves the plot but lacks the emotional resonance needed for a truly satisfying conclusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story relies on several predictable mystery tropes without subverting them. The writing occasionally becomes overly formal ("his voice steady despite the storm inside him"). Character emotions are often stated rather than demonstrated through action. The peacock-as-map concept feels contrived rather than organically developed, and the resolution follows an overly convenient pattern typical of formulaic mysteries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements reasonably well, particularly the paper airplane facility and the letter seal. However, it struggles with balancing exposition and action within the word limit. While the central mystery creates intrigue, the execution lacks the sophistication and emotional depth needed for prestigious publication. The story shows promise in its concept but needs more nuanced character development and a less convenient resolution.</comment>
