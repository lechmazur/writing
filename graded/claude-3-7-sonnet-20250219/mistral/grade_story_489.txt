<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer has a clear motivation (rescuing traditions) and the "aggressively kind" attribute shapes its actions, but lacks depth. The entity remains abstract rather than developing as a character with nuance or internal conflict. Its reactions are consistent but predictable, and without dialogue, it lacks a distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with the observer gathering strength, flinging open the door, and using the whistle to accomplish its goal. The cause-effect relationships are logical, and the story achieves a sense of completion. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and convenient, with the village immediately embracing its heritage without meaningful resistance or complexity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly established with sensory details that effectively enhance the atmosphere of ancient wisdom and forgotten traditions. The juxtaposition of the modern plastic whistle against antiquated maps creates meaningful tension. The connection between the lighthouse, the sea, and the village below creates a cohesive world where the supernatural intervention feels plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the lighthouse as a beacon of tradition) and creates a poignant moment when the village reconnects with its heritage. However, it relies too heavily on telling rather than showing emotional impact, and lacks substantive conflict or tension. The theme of preserving tradition is clear but explored somewhat superficially without deeper examination of why traditions matter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The writing contains several instances of unnecessarily ornate language ("the air thick with the undercurrent of wisdom") and relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The narrative follows a predictable pattern of supernatural intervention leading to cultural awakening without surprising twists or subversions. While the premise is interesting, the execution lacks the distinctive voice and nuanced emotional resonance that would elevate it beyond formulaic supernatural fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative, but often at the expense of depth and nuance. While the lighthouse setting and supernatural observer create an intriguing atmosphere, the resolution feels too neat and lacks the complexity that would make it truly memorable. The story has potential but needs more development of conflict and character to reach literary excellence.</comment>
