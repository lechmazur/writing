<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's character has a clear motivation and the "elegantly clumsy" attribute is referenced, but his personality lacks depth. His ghost-seeing ability feels more like a plot device than an integrated part of his character. His reaction to the flower crown reveals some introspection, but his emotional journey feels somewhat generic rather than specific to his unique circumstances.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a basic arc—discovery of object leads to reflection leads to resolution—but the "dissecting" action feels metaphorical rather than driving concrete plot events. The story relies heavily on internal reflection rather than external action, creating a somewhat static narrative. The connection between staking out ghost tours and his current situation isn't fully developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates an interesting juxtaposition with the ethereal ghost theme. Sensory details like "scent of saltwater" and "brittle yet beautiful" petals effectively establish atmosphere. The setting works as a metaphor for preserving fleeting moments, paralleling Leo's ghost encounters, though it could be more deeply integrated into the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the flower crown as a symbol connecting the physical and spiritual worlds. The theme of finding peace through acknowledging rather than escaping the past is thoughtfully developed. However, the conflict lacks urgency, and the resolution feels somewhat expected. The story tells more than it shows, particularly regarding Leo's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The writing contains several formulaic phrases ("the heart of," "the weight of their unfinished business") and relies on abstract concepts rather than specific, vivid details. Emotional states are often directly stated rather than revealed through action. The ghost narrative follows predictable patterns without subverting expectations. The prose occasionally becomes unnecessarily ornate ("the scent of saltwater mingled with...").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements reasonably well, particularly the setting, object, and concept. However, it prioritizes thematic exploration over narrative momentum, resulting in a somewhat static piece. The brevity works against developing the more complex elements like Leo's ghost-seeing ability and his specific experiences at ghost tours. The ending offers a thoughtful resolution but lacks the emotional impact of a truly memorable short piece.</comment>
