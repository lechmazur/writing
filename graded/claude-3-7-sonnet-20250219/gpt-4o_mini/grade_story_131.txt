<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character's aloofness as an orphan is established but not deeply explored. Lila's motivation to transform fear into courage emerges clearly, though her relationship with the stones could be more meaningfully developed. Her character arc from detachment to courage shows promise but lacks the nuanced psychological depth that would make her transformation truly compelling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to decision within the word constraint. The gravitational anomaly and cryptic message effectively drive the narrative forward, though the connection between these elements feels somewhat underdeveloped. The story achieves a sense of resolution as Lila decides to embrace change, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing the stakes of her transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The garage setting works effectively as both physical space and metaphorical landscape for confronting the past. The gravitational anomaly creates an intriguing supernatural element that enhances the theme of change, though it remains somewhat unexplained. Sensory details like the "softly audible creak" and the tactile quality of the stones create atmosphere, but the world-building could be more immersive with additional sensory elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the stones as symbols of resilience and adaptation, creating a metaphorical through-line. The theme of transformation is clear, though it relies more on telling than showing in key moments. The ending provides closure but lacks the emotional punch or surprising insight that would elevate it to memorable status. The conflict between clinging to the past and embracing change is present but could be rendered with more complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The writing contains several instances of overly formal phrasing and generic emotional descriptions ("her heart raced"). Metaphors like "memories to flow like water" feel familiar rather than fresh. The gravitational anomaly concept shows originality, but its integration feels somewhat mechanical. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive style, and the emotional journey relies more on stated feelings than nuanced demonstration of character growth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about transformation and courage. However, it struggles with balancing exposition and scene development in the limited word count. While the symbolic use of stones creates thematic resonance, the writing often defaults to telling rather than showing emotional states. The premise shows creative potential, but the execution lacks the distinctive voice and psychological insight needed for truly exceptional literary fiction.</comment>
