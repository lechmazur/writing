<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation to "banish doubt with unyielding will" is stated but not deeply explored. Rajiv's transformation from city planner to doomsday prepper lacks substantive development, and his "rarely authentic" attribute is merely mentioned rather than demonstrated through actions or internal conflict. The ink blotter serves as a symbol but doesn't meaningfully interact with his personality. His journey feels generic rather than specific to his established traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks clear causality and specific events. The handshake timeframe is mentioned but not integrated into a meaningful sequence of events. The action of "debasing" is vaguely applied to doubts rather than driving concrete plot developments. While there is a basic arc (Rajiv's symbolic release of the blotter), the story relies heavily on abstract internal transformation rather than external events with clear cause-effect relationships. The resolution feels premature given the limited development of conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is established with some sensory details ("flickering light of oil lamps," "air thick with incense") that create atmosphere. However, the connection between the temple and the broken constellations remains underdeveloped. The setting serves primarily as backdrop rather than an integral element that shapes the action. The temple's "ancient stones whispering secrets" shows potential but remains at the level of telling rather than showing its influence on the character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on abstract statements about transformation rather than demonstrating change through concrete events or specific details. The ink blotter symbolism is simplistic rather than layered. The conflict remains internal and vaguely defined, with resolution achieved too easily through a single symbolic act. The theme of breaking free from self-imposed limitations has potential but lacks the specificity and complexity needed for meaningful impact. The writing consistently tells rather than shows emotional states.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative exhibits several AI-writing hallmarks: repetitive phrasing ("Rajiv felt," "Rajiv knew"), generic emotional descriptions ("a sense of liberation," "a newfound sense of purpose"), and abstract rather than specific sensory details. The story relies on stating emotions directly rather than revealing them through action. The final paragraphs particularly demonstrate formulaic writing with predictable "freedom" metaphors and vague statements about the character's emotional state. The writing lacks distinctive style and relies on clich√©d expressions of transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>While the story incorporates most assigned elements, they feel artificially imposed rather than organically integrated. The narrative lacks specificity and relies on abstract statements about transformation rather than concrete events. The brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, as the character's journey lacks sufficient development to be convincing. The writing style is overly formal and relies on telling rather than showing. The story leaves little lasting impression due to its reliance on generic emotional statements rather than specific, memorable details.</comment>
