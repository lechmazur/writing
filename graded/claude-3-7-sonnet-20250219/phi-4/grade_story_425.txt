<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The character's moroseness is established but not deeply explored. Eamon's transformation feels somewhat predictable and lacks psychological complexity. His motivation to reconnect with the cosmos is stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful actions or internal struggle. The "lavishly austere" attribute appears only once without substantively shaping his character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a conventional restoration arc without significant complications or obstacles. The action of confining chaos is more told than shown. While there is a beginning, middle, and end, the resolution comes too easily, with systems simply "humming back to life" without meaningful conflict. The blackout serves as a convenient plot device rather than an organic catalyst.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The solar flare observatory creates an intriguing setting with potential, and the post-star-naming timeframe offers an interesting premise. However, sensory details are limited, with minimal description of how the observatory actually looks, sounds, or feels. The atmosphere relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete, immersive details.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story lacks substantive conflict or tension. The central metaphor of restoration mirrors the character's internal journey, but this parallel is handled with excessive telling rather than showing. The prose tends toward abstraction ("the weight of centuries") rather than specific, evocative imagery. The theme of reconnection with cosmic forces feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several AI hallmarks: overly formal language, abstract descriptions instead of specific details, and predictable emotional progression. Phrases like "a paradoxical blend of ennui and anticipation" and "played a part in the grand tapestry of the cosmos" feel generic and lack authentic voice. The narrative follows a formulaic transformation arc without surprising turns or genuine emotional depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all required elements, they often feel like checkboxes rather than organic components of a cohesive narrative. The brevity constrains rather than focuses the story, leading to abstract generalizations instead of specific moments. The central concept of restoration has potential but is executed with predictable beats and resolution without meaningful struggle.</comment>
