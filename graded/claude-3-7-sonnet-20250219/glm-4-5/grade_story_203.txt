<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's stage fright creates compelling tension against her supernatural duties, though this trait could be developed more deeply. Her relationship with her grandmother's legacy drives meaningful character evolution from fearful exorcist to confident liberator. However, her emotional journey feels somewhat accelerated and would benefit from more nuanced progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively transforms from exorcism to liberation, with the pressed wildflowers serving as both literal and metaphorical keys. While the short form necessitates some compression, the narrative maintains coherence with a satisfying revelation about the grandmother's true intentions. The subversion of expectations (from destroyer to liberator) creates a compelling arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is masterfully utilized, creating an ethereal backdrop that enhances the supernatural elements. Zero gravity becomes a perfect metaphor for the protagonist's emotional state. The contrast between cosmic vastness and intimate personal legacy creates exceptional atmospheric tension. The toy assembly drones add an uncanny, surreal quality that complements the otherworldly narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively subverts the exorcism trope, revealing deeper themes about truth, legacy, and redemption. The pressed wildflowers serve as a potent symbol connecting generations. While emotional beats land well, some metaphors ("truth and fiction blurred like stars in a nebula") feel somewhat generic. The narrative shows rather than tells the protagonist's transformation, though the ending revelation could benefit from more buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on expected metaphors and emotional descriptions. The space setting feels fresh for an exorcism tale, and the subversion of the protagonist's purpose demonstrates originality. However, some phrases ("vast emptiness of space," "redemption could bloom") lean toward predictable imagery. The narrative maintains consistent tone but could benefit from more specific sensory details unique to this unusual setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive whole, particularly merging the supernatural with science fiction. The pressed wildflowers and inheritance themes work seamlessly together. While the brevity sometimes limits deeper character exploration, the narrative achieves a satisfying emotional arc. The subversion of exorcism expectations creates lingering impact, though some transitions between elements could be more organically developed.</comment>
