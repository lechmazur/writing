<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The character's vigilance and punctuality effectively drive his conspiracy-uncovering actions, and his motivation stemming from his daughter's death provides emotional depth. However, his personality lacks nuance beyond his determined investigator role, and his "sardonic glee" feels somewhat inconsistent with his grief-driven motivation. His voice remains relatively generic without distinctive speech patterns or internal complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects the opening punctual arrival to the final triumph, creating a satisfying arc within the word constraint. The demonstration action drives the plot forward at a crucial moment, revealing the conspiracy through the peacock pattern. However, the transition from volunteer to conspiracy-uncovering mastermind feels somewhat rushed, and some causal relationships (particularly how he decoded the patterns) could be more clearly established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The contrast between the ordinary fruit farm exterior and the secret facility creates effective tension. The peacock imagery brilliantly connects to both the surveillance theme and the encryption codes. The atmosphere successfully blends mundane agricultural imagery with high-tech conspiracy, creating a unique and memorable setting that enhances both the action and the character's motivation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughout—particularly the paper airplanes representing both death and truth, and the peacock pattern revealing hidden structures. The central theme of exposing deception through careful observation is consistently developed. The emotional impact is strong, especially in connecting the protagonist's personal tragedy to his triumph. However, the conflict resolution feels somewhat predictable, and some aspects of the conspiracy remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and logical progression. The peacock pattern metaphor is original and well-integrated. However, some phrases ("The irony is delicious") feel clichéd, and the conspiracy resolution is somewhat predictable. The emotional handling occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the character's satisfaction in the final paragraphs. The writing would benefit from more specific sensory details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story effectively integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The connections between the orchardist's observational skills, the peacock pattern, and conspiracy are particularly well-handled. However, the brevity leads to some rushed development, particularly in explaining how the protagonist decoded the conspiracy. While the story has emotional resonance through the daughter's death motivation, some aspects of the conspiracy's scope and impact remain underdeveloped.</comment>
