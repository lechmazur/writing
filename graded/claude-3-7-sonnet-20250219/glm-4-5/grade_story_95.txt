<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Thomas has clear motivation to resurrect forgotten languages, and his unconventional methods reveal dedication. However, his character lacks psychological depth beyond his singular obsession. The "timidly loud" attribute is mentioned but not consistently demonstrated through actions. His emotional journey remains somewhat superficial, with limited insight into his inner conflicts or growth beyond academic excitement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc around Thomas's linguistic discoveries, with the button-folklore connection creating a satisfying climactic moment. However, the narrative structure feels episodic rather than progressive, with repetitive descriptions of his work. The cause-effect relationships between his methods and discoveries remain underdeveloped, and the stakes of his research are implied but never concretely established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of ancient languages with modern storm chasing headquarters creates a compelling atmospheric tension. The stormy setting effectively mirrors Thomas's intellectual breakthroughs, with lightning illuminating both workspace and mind. The headquarters as an "unlikely sanctuary" works thematically. However, sensory details beyond visual elements are sparse, limiting full immersion in this unique environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively establishes the theme of resurrectionâ€”both of languages and of human connection across time. The metaphor of storms mirroring intellectual discovery works well. However, the narrative relies heavily on telling rather than showing Thomas's emotional states, with phrases like "heart racing with the thrill" rather than demonstrating his reactions. The central conflict lacks urgency, and the resolution offers limited emotional payoff beyond academic satisfaction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and structure, particularly in how paragraphs begin and end. The writing relies on abstract statements about Thomas's work rather than specific, vivid examples of his discoveries. Emotions are stated rather than demonstrated through action or physiological response. The narrative voice maintains a consistent but somewhat detached tone that creates distance rather than intimacy with the protagonist's passion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story successfully integrates diverse elements into a coherent narrative about linguistic archaeology, it relies too heavily on exposition rather than scene-building. The concept is intriguing but execution lacks the specificity and emotional depth needed for true resonance. The narrative moves competently between elements but doesn't fully capitalize on their potential for conflict or revelation beyond the surface level.</comment>
