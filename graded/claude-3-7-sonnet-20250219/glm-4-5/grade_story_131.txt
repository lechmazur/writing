<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's aloofness is well-established and consistently maintained throughout. His emotional journey from self-imposed isolation to openness is believable within the context of the supernatural elements. However, the character lacks complexity beyond this singular trait - we don't see much internal conflict or nuance in his decision to change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from discovery to revelation to decision, with the garage cleaning providing a natural framework. The gravitational anomaly and stones connect well to the character's emotional state. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed and predictable, with the character's transformation happening too quickly without sufficient resistance or struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a distinctive and meaningful setting that works perfectly as a physical manifestation of the character's emotional state. The sensory details of floating tools, settling dust, and humming stones create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the story's themes. The physics of the space directly supports the character's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of gravity as emotional weight/freedom is effective and consistently applied. The story shows rather than tells Eli's transformation through his interaction with the objects. However, the ending lacks surprise - the message's meaning is too directly explained rather than allowing readers to make connections themselves. The theme of letting go is clear but handled somewhat didactically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally relies on overly explanatory phrases ("his detachment had been a shield, but now he realized it had also been a prison"). Some metaphors feel generic ("quiet ember within him"). The emotional journey follows a predictable pattern of discovery-realization-change without unexpected turns or complications that would suggest more human complexity and nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores the theme of emotional release through the metaphor of gravity. The supernatural elements serve the character development rather than existing for their own sake. However, the resolution comes too easily, and the story would benefit from more resistance to change or a less straightforward emotional transformation.</comment>
