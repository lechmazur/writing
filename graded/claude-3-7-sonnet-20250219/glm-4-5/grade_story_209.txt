<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The woodsman's motivation (mapping railways to avoid confronting his wife's illness) is psychologically coherent, and his guilt creates meaningful tension. However, his character lacks dimensionality beyond this single emotional state, and we see little evidence of his "seasoned" nature affecting his actions. The revelation feels somewhat predetermined rather than organically arising from established character traits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative builds toward a clear emotional climax when the protagonist finally acknowledges his avoidance behavior, creating a satisfying arc. However, the story struggles with pacing - the wife's death happens abruptly mid-story without sufficient setup, and the short-circuiting equipment feels more like convenient symbolism than a natural consequence of established events.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates a distinctive, surreal atmosphere that effectively externalizes the protagonist's emotional state. The water tower serves as an apt metaphor for emptiness and amplification. However, the sensory details lack specificity - we're told signals are "visible" but given little concrete description of how this unusual setting actually looks, sounds, or feels.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolic resonance between the echoing tower and the protagonist's grief. The central theme of avoidance versus presence during loss emerges organically. However, the emotional payoff feels somewhat unearned - the shift from avoidance to acceptance happens too abruptly without showing the internal struggle that would make this transformation compelling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The writing relies on telling rather than showing key emotional states ("despairing cheer that didn't quite reach his eyes"). Several metaphors feel generic ("mapping not just railways, but the contours of his grief"). The radio waves forming "a path forward" after his confession is overly convenient symbolism without logical grounding in the established world. The narrative employs predictable emotional beats rather than surprising or nuanced human reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the story effectively integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about grief and avoidance, it relies too heavily on convenient symbolism rather than earned emotional development. The surreal setting creates intrigue, but the protagonist's transformation feels rushed and predetermined. The story shows potential in its thematic resonance but would benefit from more nuanced character development and less predictable emotional progression.</comment>
