<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whimsical tinkerer's character is established with clear motivation and consistent traits, though her emotional journey lacks nuance. Her inventiveness and determination are well-portrayed through her actions with the fortune-tellers, but her internal struggle with mortality feels somewhat underdeveloped. We understand what she does more than who she is.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc despite the constraints, moving from problem identification to creative solution to resolution. The fortune-teller method is cleverly integrated, though the timeframe element feels awkwardly inserted. The causal relationships are logical, but the transition from personal acceptance to practical action could be more smoothly developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace creates a distinctive, precarious atmosphere that perfectly complements the mortality theme. The stalactite setting organically connects to the environmental monitoring motivation and creates genuine stakes. Sensory details of moisture and crystalline structures effectively establish the world, though more immersive details could further enhance the unique setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the fortune-tellers as both literal mechanics and metaphorical commentary on fate and destiny. The parallel between carnival divination and environmental monitoring creates meaningful subtext. The emotional payoff works, though the middle section relies too heavily on explanation rather than dramatization. The theme of redefining mortality as transformation rather than ending resonates well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the fortune-teller concept is original, some passages feel overly explanatory rather than immersive. The writing occasionally falls into telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the character's emotional journey. Certain transitions between paragraphs feel mechanical, and the prose sometimes relies on abstract statements rather than specific, vivid details. The countdown device, while effective, is somewhat predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The fortune-teller metaphor cleverly bridges whimsy and existential threat. The brevity works well for the concept, though some emotional beats feel rushed. The ending offers satisfying resolution while maintaining the story's established tone. More sensory immersion and character interiority would elevate it further.</comment>
