<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed through the convergence of his technical skills and supernatural sight. His motivation to understand ghosts as a way to process his sister's death is compelling and his attribute of "elegantly clumsy" manifests physically and emotionally. However, his character lacks enough individualized voice or truly distinctive traits beyond the assigned elements to reach excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure creates a clear arc of Marcus using ghost tours to "dissect" his supernatural experiences, with his grief providing emotional stakes. The integration of his elevator repair skills as a metaphor for fixing his broken heart is effective. However, the story lacks a definitive incident or tension point that would elevate it from setup to fully realized narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates an unexpectedly resonant settingâ€”delicate structures requiring preservation mirror Marcus's fragile emotional state. The contrast between mechanical repair work and the ethereal ghost world creates compelling atmospheric tension. Sensory details like "the soft hum of preservation equipment" effectively blend the mundane and supernatural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the flower crown as a bridge between worlds) and creates meaningful parallels between repairing elevators and emotional healing. The theme of navigating boundaries between worlds is resonant. However, it lacks a sufficiently distinctive narrative voice and relies more on telling than showing Marcus's emotional journey, particularly regarding his sister's absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally relies on predictable emotional beats and somewhat generic ghost story elements. Phrases like "complex simplicity" and "dissect his experiences methodically" feel self-consciously literary. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive style that would elevate it above competent prose to something memorably unique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole with emotional resonance. Marcus's dual existence between the mechanical and supernatural worlds creates a compelling character study. However, it remains more of a situation than a complete narrative, promising a journey that hasn't fully begun within the constraints of the word count.</comment>
