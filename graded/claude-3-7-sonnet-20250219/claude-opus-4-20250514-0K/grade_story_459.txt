<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's character development is strong, with her occupation as elevator technician thoughtfully woven into her supernatural ability. Her "elegantly clumsy" attribute manifests organically in her actions with the flower crown. The connection between her technical approach to diagnosing elevators and methodically "dissecting" her gift creates compelling character consistency. Her motivation becomes increasingly clear as the story progresses. However, her initial emotional state could be more deeply established, and we could use more insight into how long she's been struggling with this ability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the lunch break timeframe to create a container for the narrative. Maya's methodical "dissection" drives the plot forward logically, and her breakthrough creates a satisfying arc. The connection between preserved sand castles and trapped spirits is clever. The plot moves from problem to understanding to resolution efficiently within the word constraint. However, the stakes could be better established early on, and the transition between her understanding her gift and taking action feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is brilliantly conceived and executed—a perfect setting for a story about preservation versus release. The silence during lunch breaks creates both practical opportunity and thematic resonance. The juxtaposition of scientific preservation and spiritual liberation creates meaningful tension. Sensory details are specific and evocative, particularly in how the dried flower crown crumbles into the sand, symbolically joining the medium of the castles themselves. The atmosphere of quiet clinical preservation makes the emotional breakthrough more impactful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves impressive depth within its constraints. The metaphorical relationship between elevators (physical transportation) and Maya's ability to help spirits transition is subtly brilliant. The central theme of "liberation living not in escaping her gift but embracing it" resonates powerfully. The final line delivers thematic punch: "sometimes preservation is just another word for haunting." However, the emotional arc could be more viscerally rendered—we understand Maya's realization intellectually but might benefit from feeling it more deeply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unconventional take on ghost-seeing and the unique setting of a sand castle lab. The metaphorical connections between Maya's job and gift show creative depth. The language generally avoids purple prose while maintaining literary quality. However, certain phrases like "beautifully awkward in her newfound purpose" and "complex simplicity" feel slightly forced. Some emotional transitions could be shown more organically rather than stated. The piece also follows a somewhat predictable epiphany structure, though it executes it well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its required elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The elevator technician role and ghost-seeing ability work together thematically rather than feeling randomly paired. The sand castle preservation lab becomes more than just a setting—it's integral to the story's message about the tension between preservation and release. The brevity feels appropriate rather than limiting. While some transitions could be smoother and certain metaphors more organic, the overall achievement is impressive in creating a meaningful narrative that leaves the reader with lingering questions about our own attachments.</comment>
