<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "daring pathfinder" with "ingeniously clueless" traits is well-executedâ€”her brilliance and obsession with puzzles make her oblivious to danger, creating compelling dramatic irony. Her descent into madness is believable, though we could have seen more of her emotional complexity beyond her intellectual obsession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot effectively weaves disparate elements into a cohesive supernatural mystery with clear causality. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the doorknob fragment brilliantly connecting to both the beginning quest and the character's ultimate fate, creating a cyclical structure that enhances the horror.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the abandoned roller coaster with haunted inns creates a uniquely unsettling atmosphere. The world-building through housekeeping logs provides an innovative narrative device, while the sensory details of the "doorknob growing warm" and reality "folding" effectively convey the supernatural breakdown of reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in creating intellectual and emotional resonance through potent imagery and subtext. The metaphor of "reality eroding like chalk drawings in rain" and the transformation of the character into "a sound like pages rustling in an empty library" demonstrate exceptional craft. The theme of obsession consuming the pursuer is elegantly executed, with satisfying circularity in the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in its concept of housekeeping logs as supernatural warnings and doorknobs as portals. The writing avoids AI-typical patterns through consistent tone and fresh metaphors like "that peculiar madness that whispers rather than shouts." Some phrases like "ingeniously clueless" appear somewhat repetitive, but overall the narrative maintains distinctive style and voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>This story demonstrates exceptional integration of assigned elements into a cohesive, haunting narrative. The doorknob, housekeeping logs, and roller coaster setting feel essential rather than forced. The prose balances accessibility with literary flourish, and the cyclical ending creates lingering unease that elevates the piece beyond its word count constraints.</comment>
