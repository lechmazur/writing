<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hermit's character is effectively shaped by her "theoretically rebellious" nature, revealed through her methodical approach to resurrection and scientific understanding of nature. Her motivation to restore life to barren land is consistently portrayed through her patient calculations and meticulous documentation. What prevents a higher score is the limited insight into her emotional journey—we understand her purpose but not fully her internal life beyond her scientific devotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates exceptional coherence within its constraints. The story skillfully establishes the hermit's ritual, builds tension through the comet's arrival, and achieves resolution with the sprouting seeds. The act of translation—converting cosmic movements into earthly growth—drives the narrative effectively. The specific 47-degree angle creates intriguing specificity. The causal relationship between the hermit's careful preparations and the final success creates a satisfying arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is remarkably strong, with the ghostly orchard and blazing comet creating a perfect liminal space between death and potential rebirth. The sensory details are precise and evocative—the crimson light, skeletal trees, and the weathervane's exact positioning all contribute to an atmosphere of scientific mysticism. The contrast between the barren valley and the memory of fertility creates tension, while the comet provides both literal and metaphorical illumination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story exhibits sophisticated craft through its central metaphor of translation between cosmic and earthly languages. The subtext about patience versus desperation and science versus superstition adds thematic depth. The imagery of pressed flowers as preserved memories is particularly effective. The ending provides both resolution (sprouting seeds) and forward momentum (her plans for the next field). The narrative effectively shows rather than tells, allowing the ritual's success to demonstrate the character's competence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates significant originality in its concept and execution, there are moments of slightly ornate language that verge on purple prose ("theater of crimson light," "patience wedded to precision"). The core concept—the intersection of astronomy, botany and patient calculation—feels fresh. The hermit avoids stereotypical portrayal, but occasionally her characterization leans toward the familiar trope of the misunderstood outsider with special knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable coherence while incorporating multiple complex elements. The pressed flower album, weathervane, and comet all serve essential narrative functions rather than feeling artificially included. The brevity feels appropriate rather than constraining, allowing just enough space to establish the ritual and its payoff. The final image of the hermit already calculating angles for the next field creates a satisfying sense of continuity beyond the story's boundaries.</comment>
