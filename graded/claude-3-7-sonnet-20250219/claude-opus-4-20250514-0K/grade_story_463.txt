<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus Thorne's dry wit effectively masks deeper emotions, creating compelling complexity. His sense of duty contrasts with Elara's betrayal, and their interaction reveals layers to both characters. The dance sequence brilliantly illustrates their relationship dynamics. However, Marcus's initial motivations could be more clearly established before the revelation at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves smoothly from discovery to confrontation to revelation, with the confiscation of evidence driving narrative momentum. The spectral dance serves dual purposes as both ritual and character development. The circular ending with Marcus discovering his own name creates a satisfying twist that recontextualizes the entire story, though the specific nature of Elara's betrayal could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work creates a tangible sense of decay, isolation, and supernatural tension. The lighthouse setting perfectly embodies the themes of guidance, betrayal, and erosion. Sensory details—salt smells, glass breaking underwater, blood sizzling on salt-stained floors—create immersive sensory dimensions that enhance the ghostly maritime setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable thematic depth within its constraints, using the lighthouse and erosion as potent metaphors for moral decay. The spectral dance sequence creates visceral tension while advancing plot and character. The ending delivers both emotional and intellectual impact, suggesting universal human fallibility. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, revealing character through subtext rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creative originality in its ghost-dance ritual and maritime setting. Language is largely fresh, avoiding clichés about hauntings and betrayal. However, some phrases ("ghostly feet," "her form materializing like fog") veer toward familiar ghost story territory. The metaphorical system around erosion shows consistent development rather than relying on disconnected pretty phrases.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic resonance. The spectral lighthouse setting and ritual dance create a distinctive atmosphere that elevates the piece beyond its constraints. The ending achieves both narrative closure and philosophical openness. Minor clarity issues around the specific nature of the betrayal and the exact function of the list prevent a higher score.</comment>
