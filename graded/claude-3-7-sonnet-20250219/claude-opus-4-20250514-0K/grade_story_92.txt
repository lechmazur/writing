<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Margot shows strong development as she transitions from servant to keeper. Her willingness to cross boundaries is well-motivated by curiosity ("to finally understand what the ultra-rich truly paid her to ignore"). However, her inner conflict could be more deeply explored, and her dialogue remains somewhat limited, preventing a fuller character portrait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively builds tension from Margot's arrival to her transformation into a "guardian." The narrative arc feels complete, moving from innocence to revelation. However, some cause-effect relationships remain underdeveloped, particularly regarding the "previous walker" and the exact nature of what Margot is agreeing to, leaving key plot mechanics implied rather than established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion setting is richly rendered with specific sensory details like "crystal teeth caught the dying light" and plants that shift "despite the still air." The unnatural sunset creates perfect atmosphere for the supernatural transformation. The mansion breathes with tension, effectively embodying the story's supernatural elements while maintaining believability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story creates powerful atmosphere and tension through effective sensory details and metaphors. The transformation from dog walker to "keeper" carries thematic weight about power, wealth, and complicity. The ending delivers satisfying closure while maintaining mystery. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows ("understanding this dance") and some metaphors ("like smoke") feel familiar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI pitfalls, some elements feel formulaic: the triple-beat sentence structure ("In this profession, one learned to justify the unjustifiable, to pretend not to notice when reality bent at the edges"), and certain metaphors ("like watercolors in rain"). The supernatural elements, while intriguing, follow somewhat predictable patterns of wealthy people harboring dark secrets.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with memorable imagery and atmosphere. The supernatural transformation offers both surface tension and deeper themes about wealth and complicity. However, some plot mechanics remain underdeveloped, and occasional reliance on familiar phrasing and structure prevents the piece from achieving its full potential.</comment>
