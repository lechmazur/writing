<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's daughter as an unseen observer is effectively established with clear motivation, while the young visitor is characterized through her "aggressively kind determination" that reveals both her personality and purpose. Both characters have distinct personalities that drive their actions, though dialogue is absent and deeper character complexity is limited by the brief format.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ritual performance provides a strong narrative arc with clear beginning, middle, and climax. The plot connects logically from the ghost's observation to the ritual's completion and the lighthouse beam igniting. The pacing effectively builds tension through the ceremony while maintaining coherence within the word constraints, creating a satisfying sense of completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly realized through exceptional sensory details like "dust motes danced in the air like tiny ghosts" and "shadows writhed unnaturally along the walls." The atmosphere perfectly complements both the supernatural elements and the theme of honoring tradition, with the physical space becoming an active participant in the ritual rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of tradition, memory, and connection between generations through both literal plot and metaphorical elements. The narrative demonstrates skilled use of showing rather than telling, with the emotional impact delivered through specific actions and atmospheric details. The satisfying conclusion reinforces the central theme that "some things never truly die as long as someone remembers to call them home."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates originality in its approach to ghost stories and ritual magic, avoiding predictable horror tropes. The language generally avoids purple prose while maintaining evocative imagery. Some phrases like "impossibly deep and resonant" and "fierce grace" verge on clich√©, but most descriptions feel specific and purposeful. The consistent tone and emotional resonance suggest authentic human writing rather than algorithmic patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The supernatural ritual framework allows diverse elements to feel organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating an atmospheric ghost story with thematic depth about tradition and memory that lingers beyond its conclusion. Minor weaknesses in originality are outweighed by effective storytelling craft.</comment>
