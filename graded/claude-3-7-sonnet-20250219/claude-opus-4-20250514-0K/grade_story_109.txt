<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "cold-natured knight" is effectively characterized through his methodical approach and compassionate motivations. His devotion to his grandmother creates a clear motivation, though his transformation from rule-follower to rule-bender could be more explicitly tied to his internal struggle. The character's emotional journey is evident but would benefit from more nuance in how his "cold nature" evolves into finding purpose through completing what others left unfinished.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot has a well-defined arc within the constraints, with the knight's discovery of the formula and subsequent understanding of the altars' purpose providing a satisfying resolution. The connection between the mitten, the remedies, and the incomplete altars is cleverly constructed. However, the revelation about the altars feels slightly rushed, and the transition from seeking a remedy to understanding the deeper purpose of the agency could be more organically developed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned department store, deserted intersection, and flickering lights create a compelling atmosphere of isolation and liminality that enhances the themes of loss and healing. The contrast between the cold exterior world and the sanctuary-like quality of the secret center is effectively drawn. Sensory details like the humming fluorescent lights and the warmth of the mitten create a vivid sense of place that supports the story's emotional landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the mitten as a symbol of generational connection and unexpected vessels of healing. The theme of finding rebellion in completion and healing through artistic expression resonates emotionally. The ending provides meaningful closure while suggesting continued impact. While the central conflict and emotional journey are clear, some metaphors (particularly around "cold nature") could be developed with more subtlety rather than being directly stated in the concluding paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of incomplete altars as invitations to shared healing. However, some phrasing feels slightly formulaic, particularly in the final paragraph where the character's transformation is explicitly stated rather than fully shown. The narrative occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than revealing them through action. While the concept is fresh, certain transitions between plot points could be more organically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The knight's quest for healing transforms into something more profound - a communal act of support through artistic completion. The brevity works well for the contained arc, though some connections could be more subtly crafted. The lingering image of the completed altar with the mitten attached provides a powerful closing note that extends beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
