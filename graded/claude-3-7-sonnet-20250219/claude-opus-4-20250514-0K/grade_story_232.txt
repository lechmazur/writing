<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The physician aspect is established but underutilized after the opening. Elena's transition from medicine to archaeology has potential but lacks nuanced development. Her motivation is clear but her emotional journey feels somewhat generic. We see her actions but don't deeply feel her internal conflict between her medical career and archaeological passion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot coherently connects Elena's past with her present discovery, creating a satisfying narrative arc within the word constraint. The "scramble" action effectively drives momentum at a key moment. However, the revelation about the pirate's cutlass feels somewhat rushed and convenient rather than earned through the narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The digital nomad camp provides an effective modern contrast to the ancient subject matter, and the "horizon's edge" timeframe creates atmospheric tension. Sensory details like the coffee grounds pattern and "pewter line" where sky meets sea create vivid immersion. The Guatemalan setting naturally connects to the Mayan ruins without overexplanation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively builds intrigue around the archaeological mystery and Elena's personal journey. The coffee grounds pattern creates a striking moment of synchronicity. However, the theme of reconciling different knowledge systems (medical and archaeological) could be more subtly integrated rather than explicitly stated. The story relies on telling the reader about "quietly dramatic" implications rather than letting them emerge organically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing, the story relies on somewhat predictable tropes (burnt-out professional, ancient mystery). The "dire enchantment" feels inserted rather than emerging from the narrative. The writing occasionally slips into unnecessarily ornate phrasing ("worked across the hush of horizon's edge") that draws attention to itself rather than serving the story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates most required elements into a coherent narrative with an intriguing premise. The juxtaposition of modern digital nomad culture with ancient archaeology creates interesting tension. However, some connections (especially between the coffee grounds, cutlass, and temple) feel more convenient than organic, and the resolution comes too easily for a truly compelling literary piece.</comment>
