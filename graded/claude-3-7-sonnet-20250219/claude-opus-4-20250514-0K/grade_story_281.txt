<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from thief to poet is compelling and psychologically credible. His epiphany feels earned through the dummy's catalyzing presence. However, his shift from "baffled" to philosophical happens somewhat abruptly, and we could use more glimpses of his pre-transformation character to make the contrast more powerful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves effectively from discovery to transformation, with the dummy as catalyst. The story achieves a satisfying completeness despite constraints, with Marcus's poetry serving as both method and evidence of change. The lighthouse setting's symbolic resonance with illumination/guidance enhances the transformation theme, though the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse engine room creates potent atmospheric tension—rust, salt stains, and mechanical groans provide vivid sensory details that mirror Marcus's internal machinery being reawakened. The haunted quality manifests perfectly through the dummy rather than through supernatural clichés, and the contrast between the cold, damp setting and Marcus's awakening consciousness is effectively rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ventriloquist dummy as both literal object and metaphor for Marcus's suppressed authentic voice. The poetry device works doubly as plot mechanism and thematic reinforcement. The conflict between theft/taking and creation/giving creates meaningful subtext, though the ending lacks some nuance in its decisive transformation. The lighthouse symbolism (illumination, guidance) adds layered meaning without heavy-handedness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution sometimes slips into overly neat psychological revelations. The poetry, while thematically appropriate, occasionally feels too polished for truly impromptu verse. Some phrases ("scorching poise," "sustains the soul's rebellion") read as unnecessarily ornate. The dummy's dialogue sometimes serves exposition rather than character, though the central metaphor of theft versus creation remains fresh and compelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about transformation and self-discovery. The ventriloquist dummy serves as both plot device and metaphor, while the poetry mechanism feels purposeful rather than gimmicky. The philosophical dimension elevates what could have been a simple ghost story. Despite some moments of overwriting, the story creates genuine emotional resonance through its exploration of emptiness and redemptive creativity.</comment>
