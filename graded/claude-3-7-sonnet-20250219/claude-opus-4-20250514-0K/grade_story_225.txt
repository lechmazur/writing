<question>1</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>There is no character development whatsoever. The story consists of a single word ("refusal") with no characters present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>The single-word story lacks any plot structure, beginning, middle, or end. There is no narrative arc, no development, and no coherence beyond the concept of refusal itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>The story contains no setting, sensory details, or atmospheric elements. The single word fails to establish any world or environment for the reader to experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>0.1</grade><comment>While "refusal" as a concept could potentially spark reflection, the complete absence of narrative development, conflict, or theme exploration renders any storytelling impact virtually nonexistent. At best, it's an extremely minimal conceptual piece that fails as a story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>The single-word approach could be considered original in its extreme minimalism, but it fails to demonstrate craft, nuance, or meaningful expression. It reads more as non-engagement with the assignment rather than an artistic choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>The submission completely fails as a story by any conventional measure. It lacks all essential narrative elements, demonstrates no craft or creativity in incorporating assigned elements, and offers no meaningful experience to the reader.</comment>
