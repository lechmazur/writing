<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's loyalty is well-established as her core character trait, creating tension with her growing doubts. Her PTSD symptoms and internal conflict between duty and conscience are convincingly portrayed. However, her transformation from seeking peace to active resistance happens rather abruptly, without fully exploring the psychological complexity this shift deserves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot builds effectively from meditation-seeking to discovering a nefarious activation plot, with clear cause-effect relationships. The story achieves narrative completeness through Mara's decision to subvert the system. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushedâ€”her sudden ability to hijack broadcasts and craft counter-codes would benefit from earlier groundwork suggesting such capabilities.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower is brilliantly utilized as both literal setting and metaphorical space. The darkness, flickering lights, and radio static create palpable atmosphere that mirrors Mara's internal state. The parallel between moth metamorphosis and Mara's transformation is subtle yet effective, with sensory details like the static-laden broadcasts enhancing the unsettling mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully explores themes of duty versus conscience through well-crafted symbolism, particularly the moths drawn to dying lights mirroring sleeper agents being activated. The central conflict is clear and the resolution offers meaningful subversion of expectations. However, the emotional depth occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Mara's internal turmoil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose avoids most AI hallmarks, with consistent tone and style throughout. The metaphor of moths and transformation feels organic rather than forced. However, certain phrases ("sanctified dread," "ghost-light of the failing grid") verge on purple prose, and the handling of the coded broadcasts lacks the technical specificity that would make this element fully convincing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine tension and moral complexity. The spy thriller premise meshes well with psychological introspection, creating depth beyond its surface plot. While the resolution relies somewhat on convenient skills and timing, the overall effect is of a thoughtful exploration of loyalty and conscience during crisis.</comment>
