<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Li Wei's character is effectively shaped by his identity as a chameleon actor whose method involves physically embodying the missing to solve mysteries. His "rationally impulsive" nature appears in his approach to performance, and his relationship with the tattered doll's dress reveals his empathetic connection to victims. However, his personal stakes and deeper psychological motivations beyond his professional purpose remain somewhat underdeveloped, leaving some potential depth unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates impressive coherence within the constraints, moving from discovery to investigation to revelation with clear causality. Wei's method of solving mysteries through performance drives the narrative forward logically to the discovery of the twelve murdered children. The resolution provides both emotional payoff and thematic resonance about art surviving civilization's collapse. The pacing efficiently builds tension while maintaining clarity about the central mystery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The post-oil world with its repurposed palace creates a hauntingly evocative setting that enhances both plot and theme. The contrast between ancient architecture and solar panels visually represents the story's themes of preserving the past while moving forward. "Sunlight through debris" functions brilliantly as both literal description and metaphor for uncovering buried truths. Sensory details—jasmine scent, dust motes like ghosts, fear-sweat—create immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves emotional resonance through its exploration of performance as both art and truth-seeking. The central metaphor of embodying others to find hidden truths works on multiple levels, connecting to themes of cultural preservation and justice. The ending creates poignant ambiguity about what exactly the audience mourns. The story effectively shows rather than tells Wei's process, allowing readers to witness his transformation and discovery rather than merely being told about it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its post-apocalyptic setting that focuses on cultural preservation rather than survival horror tropes. The concept of solving mysteries through embodied performance offers a fresh approach. However, certain phrases like "anxious serenity" feel somewhat forced rather than organically arising from character, and the villain's motivation (fearing young talent would expose mediocrity) relies on a somewhat familiar artistic jealousy trope without sufficient development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores meaningful themes about art, truth, and cultural memory. The brevity feels appropriate rather than constraining, allowing just enough space to establish the unique setting and method while maintaining narrative momentum. The emotional weight of the children's fate resonates beyond the page, suggesting depths beyond the explicit narrative, though certain elements (like the "anxious serenity") could be more organically integrated.</comment>
