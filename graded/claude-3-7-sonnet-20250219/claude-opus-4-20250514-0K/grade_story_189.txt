<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bright-eyed apprentice demonstrates clear motivation through her quest to decode star maps, and her uniquely literal interpretation differentiates her from others. However, her characterization lacks depth - we learn what she does but little about who she is. Her "brazen calm" is told rather than shown, and her internal conflicts or personal stakes remain undeveloped beyond serving the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative maintains strong coherence despite its brevity, with the action of overcharging the terminal driving the plot effectively. The story achieves a satisfying arc from discovery to realization to future intent. The cause-effect relationships between the key, terminal, and revealed star maps flow logically. However, the parsing of notes slipped under doors receives insufficient development relative to its significance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work creates a vivid post-apocalyptic setting. The haunted lighthouse basement with phosphorescent moss, dripping seawater, and electromagnetic pulses delivers memorable sensory detail. The timeframe after water wars is seamlessly integrated, informing both physical environment and plot stakes. The ghostly presence is particularly well-rendered, transformed from standard hauntings into meaningful remnants of knowledge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively builds intrigue and delivers a satisfying revelation with significant stakes. Its imagery is vivid and purposeful, particularly in juxtaposing technological remnants with natural degradation. However, while the central theme of preserving knowledge amidst collapse resonates, the story occasionally defaults to telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the apprentice's emotional state and the significance of her discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of technological archaeology with spectral assistance, avoiding expected ghost story tropes. However, certain phrases ("grand designs require grand risks") feel formulaic, and some descriptions resort to telling emotional states rather than showing them. The narrative voice occasionally shifts into overly formal exposition that breaks the immersive quality, particularly when explaining the historical context of the Water Wars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with genuine emotional stakes. Its strongest asset is the atmospheric world-building that creates a distinctive post-apocalyptic setting. While the protagonist lacks sufficient personal dimension and some exposition feels mechanical rather than organic, the story's integration of technological archaeology and spectral assistance creates a memorable premise with both intellectual and emotional resonance.</comment>
