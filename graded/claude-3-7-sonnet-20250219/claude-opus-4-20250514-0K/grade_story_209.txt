<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is richly developed through his obsession with mapping abandoned railways, which effectively masks his true motivation to find his brother. His connection to the hairbrush reveals deep familial bonds and guilt. The character's inner conflict between maintaining deception and seeking truth drives the narrative powerfully, though his dialogue occasionally feels slightly mechanical rather than organic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's lifelong search with his wife's final moments, creating a complete arc despite the brevity. The short-circuit metaphor works brilliantly as both literal radio interference and the breaking of decades of deception. The cause-effect relationship between his childhood decision and lifelong guilt is masterfully conveyed. The resolution provides emotional catharsis while maintaining narrative coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates an evocative, almost supernatural atmosphere that perfectly complements the theme of signals, lost connections, and reaching across distances. The water tower serves as both practical tool and powerful symbol. The juxtaposition of wilderness/abandoned infrastructure with clinical hospital setting creates meaningful contrast. Sensory details like raindrops in the beard and wet grass underfoot ground the narrative physically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional impact by weaving personal guilt with universal themes of truth and redemption. The hairbrush and railway function as powerful symbols of loss and connection. The tension between Marcus's deception and his need for absolution creates a compelling emotional core. The final image of radio waves carrying truth "into the morning, where abandoned railways waited to reveal their dead" delivers a haunting, resonant conclusion that elevates the entire piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns through its specific, unified metaphorical framework and emotional complexity. The connection between radio signals and human communication feels fresh rather than formulaic. However, phrases like "despairing cheer" and "evidence of a family that had loved despite secrets" edge toward telling rather than showing. The narrative maintains consistent tone and authentic emotional nuance while avoiding predictable beats or purple prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. The central metaphor of mapping, searching, and signals unifies the piece. The brevity feels deliberate, not constraining. The emotional weight of lifelong guilt and deathbed confession lingers beyond the final line. What elevates this piece is how the technical elements (radio waves, echoes, mapping) perfectly complement the emotional core (guilt, confession, absolution) without feeling contrived.</comment>
