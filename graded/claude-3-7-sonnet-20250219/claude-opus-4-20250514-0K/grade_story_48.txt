<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desert wanderer is established with clear motivation and a distinctive presence. Her dedication to preserving translated love is consistent throughout, and her history across "three dying worlds" adds depth. However, we get limited insight into her personality beyond her mission, and her emotional response feels somewhat over-explained rather than revealed through actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from observation to completion of the wanderer's mission, with the falling apple providing effective framing. The research action drives the narrative forward purposefully, connecting the protagonist's personal journey to cosmic significance. The resolution feels earned, though the transition from scientific discovery to emotional revelation is somewhat abrupt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the space pirate ship against Earth's last orchard creates a compelling visual contrast. The crow's nest setting functions beautifully as a liminal space between worlds. Atmospheric details like the "atmospheric distortion" and the apple "defying gravity and time" create a vivid sensory experience that enhances the metaphysical themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the falling apple as both literal event and metaphor for humanity's connection to Earth. The theme of love as a universal translator resonates emotionally and intellectually. However, some passages rely too heavily on telling emotional significance rather than allowing readers to discover it, and certain metaphors ("physics into poetry") feel somewhat conventional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept of translated love is innovative, the execution occasionally slips into predictable sci-fi spiritualism. Phrases like "love could be translated without loss" and "love was the only truly universal language" feel somewhat formulaic. The writing shows distinctive style but occasionally becomes overwrought with metaphysical abstractions rather than grounding concepts in specific, unique imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constituent parts. The balance between cosmic significance and personal mission creates meaningful tension. While occasionally veering into overly poetic language that prioritizes sound over clarity, the narrative maintains focus on its central themes and achieves emotional resonance through its exploration of connection and preservation.</comment>
