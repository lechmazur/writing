<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The contrite swordsman's character is established through his regret over the peacock incident, which drives his actions consistently. His rigidity and hypnotic cadence effectively show his psychological state. However, his shift from dutiful unmasker to empathetic accomplice feels somewhat abrupt rather than fully earned through deeper character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the tattoo unraveling as a central action that drives the narrative forward. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word constraint, moving from the swordsman's guilt to unexpected redemption. The revelation about Morris works well as a turning point, though the political implications of their alliance remain somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating island spa creates a genuinely distinctive atmosphere that enhances the story's surreal tone. Sensory details like "aromatherapy candles smelling of regret and lavender" and the unsettling peace "like a library where someone might scream" create vivid, unconventional imagery that elevates the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of redemption and unexpected connection. The central metaphor of unraveling tattoos to reveal truth works both literally and symbolically. The narrative shows rather than tells emotional shifts through specific details like "tears cutting through the makeup" and the swordsman's posture finally relaxing. The ending presents a meaningful moral choice that resonates beyond the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unusual setting and the creative use of yarn for tattoo reading. The prose avoids becoming purple despite its fantastical elements. While some phrases like "like sugar in rain" veer toward clich√©, most descriptions feel fresh. The narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout, blending whimsy with emotional depth in a way that feels deliberate rather than algorithmic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that balances absurdist humor with genuine emotional resonance. The floating spa, yarn reading, and cryptic tattoos could easily feel like random inclusions, but instead form an internally consistent world. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a concentrated narrative that leaves room for reader interpretation about the kingdom's future.</comment>
