<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Meredith's characterization as a relaxed pathfinder manifests well through her curious approach to the supernatural phenomenon. Her "wisely foolish" attribute is clearly demonstrated in her decision to accept the job and her grandmother's advice shows character depth. However, her transformation from investigator to empathetic listener happens somewhat abruptly, and her personal stakes in the situation remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from investigation to resolution with the ghost composer finding peace. The musical notes as breadcrumbs device effectively drives the narrative forward. However, the story rushes through important moments—particularly the composer's transformation and release—without fully earning the emotional payoff. The cause-and-effect relationship between Meredith learning the song and the ghost's liberation feels slightly underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion cellar is vividly realized with excellent sensory details like "frost-etched cobwebs" and the foundation stones rattling. The winter timeframe perfectly complements the theme of trapped creativity awaiting release. The transformative atmosphere where wine bottles become organ pipes and paintings transform into sheet music creates a richly immersive setting that directly serves the core concept of overlapping realities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the musical notes as both literal plot device and metaphor for unexpressed creativity. The theme of self-expression as liberation resonates strongly and creates a meaningful emotional impact. The subtext about the "terrible cost of keeping one's gifts locked away" elevates the narrative beyond its supernatural premise. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed, and the final metaphor of "mosaic realities" could be more organically integrated throughout rather than explicitly stated at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-like formulaic writing with specific, purposeful imagery and metaphors. The concept of "mosaic realities" feels original in its application. However, certain phrasings like "understanding flooding through her" and "understanding now that self-expression wasn't just power—it was liberation" rely on telling rather than showing emotional realizations. The ghost musician trope is familiar, but the lens revealing multiple overlapping realities provides a fresh perspective on this concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole, particularly the cracked lens as both plot device and metaphor. The core theme of liberation through creative expression emerges naturally from the narrative rather than feeling imposed. While the brevity constrains full character development, the story still achieves emotional resonance and leaves the reader with a meaningful reflection on the importance of sharing one's gifts. The earnest tone occasionally drifts toward sentimentality but generally maintains its impact.</comment>
