<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and his grief-as-cover is compelling. His methodical, vigilant nature aligns well with his orchardist background and punctual attribute. However, his character lacks dimensionality beyond his missionâ€”we get little sense of his internal conflicts or emotional evolution. Helena serves mainly as exposition and antagonist rather than a fully realized character. Their dialogue reveals character but occasionally feels too on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conspiracy plot is efficiently constructed with clear cause-effect relationships. The story achieves a satisfying arc despite constraints, building from setup to revelation with effective pacing. The demonstration of patterns provides a logical plot driver, and the peacock motif creates cohesion. However, the conspiracy mechanics remain somewhat vague, and the climactic revelation relies more on telling than showing the consequences of Marcus's investigation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility creates an effectively ironic backdrop for agricultural conspiracy investigation. The contrast between harsh fluorescent lighting and Marcus's natural orchardist background enhances the sense of him operating in hostile territory. Sensory details like the humming lights and wax spreading "like spilled blood" create vivid atmosphere. The peacock imagery forms a cohesive visual motif that connects setting to plot elegantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the peacock motif as both literal plot device and metaphor for "elaborate displays" hiding "deadly intentions." The subtext about agricultural control and heritage seeds touches on relevant contemporary concerns. The narrative creates genuine tension and the ending provides satisfying resolution while suggesting larger consequences. The grief-as-cover concept adds emotional depth to what could have been merely a conspiracy thriller. Dialogue is purposeful and advances characterization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific imagery and context-appropriate language. The peacock metaphor is fresh rather than generic. There's consistent tone throughout with no abrupt shifts. However, some phrases like "sardonic glee" feel slightly formulaic, and Marcus's characterization occasionally veers toward the archetypal "grieving avenger" without fully subverting this trope. The conspiracy framework, while well-executed, follows somewhat predictable patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each serves the plot rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a tightly constructed vignette that hints at a larger world. The conspiracy framework provides momentum, while the personal tragedy gives emotional weight. The peacock pattern motif adds visual distinctiveness. What prevents a higher score is the reliance on some conspiracy thriller conventions and the somewhat limited exploration of Marcus's emotional journey beyond his mission.</comment>
