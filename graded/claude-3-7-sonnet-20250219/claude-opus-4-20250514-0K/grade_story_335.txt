<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The shaky mercenary's characterization is well-developed through the physical manifestation of his trauma (trembling hands) and his quest for peace. His "carefully reckless" attribute effectively shapes his actions and approach to life. However, the character lacks deeper psychological exploration and a more distinct voice that would elevate him beyond archetypical parameters. His history in Moldova remains intriguingly vague but somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the mercenary's internal conflict with the external quest, creating a cohesive narrative arc within the word constraint. The structure builds naturally toward the climactic moment of release. The "finalize" action drives meaningful resolution. The only weakness is the somewhat rushed introduction of the street artists near the end, which feels slightly contrived as a plot mechanism rather than an organic development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral's transformation into a street art sanctuary creates a powerful visual and thematic backdrop. The contrast between ancient ruins and modern graffiti mirrors the character's struggle between past and present. Exceptional sensory details bring the setting alive—the dying light through broken arches, echoing acoustics, and the makeshift altar. The atmosphere perfectly embodies the spiritual liminality of the character's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively employs symbolism (the trapped spider as paralyzed time) and creates emotional resonance through the act of physical and metaphorical release. The central theme of letting go is powerfully conveyed through action rather than exposition. The ending offers genuine catharsis. However, the story occasionally relies on somewhat predictable metaphors, and the dialogue from the tattooed girl feels slightly too on-the-nose rather than organically revealing the story's message.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creative interpretation of assigned elements, particularly in connecting the amber spider to the concept of frozen time and inability to move forward. The writing avoids AI-typical patterns and maintains a consistent voice. However, some metaphors like "hands steady as mountains" and "broken soldiers, grieving mothers" verge on cliché, and phrases like "impossible longing" and "shifting like forgiveness" occasionally lean toward purple prose without fully earning their emotional weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative successfully integrates numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole with genuine emotional depth. The amber spider serves as both literal object and potent metaphor, while the cathedral setting perfectly frames the spiritual journey. What prevents a higher score is the slight reliance on telling rather than showing in a few key moments, and the somewhat convenient appearance of the street artists to facilitate the resolution. Nevertheless, the story achieves considerable impact within its constraints.</comment>
