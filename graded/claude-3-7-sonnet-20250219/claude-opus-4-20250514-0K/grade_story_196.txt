<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The paradoxical "fiercely apathetic" character trait is well-developed and consistent. The swordsman's exhaustion masking deeper determination creates compelling tension. His motivation (keeping a promise to himself) feels authentic and drives his actions logically. However, lacking dialogue or direct interiority limits our full understanding of his character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative forms a complete arc within its constraints, following the swordsman from contemplation to decision to action with logical progression. The meteor-following ritual connects meaningfully to his inner struggle. However, the plot relies heavily on internal conflict with minimal external obstacles, and the action of "overcoming" feels somewhat abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery creates a distinctive, evocative setting that beautifully complements the character's psychological state. The physical elevation mirrors his spiritual journey, while the meteor showers provide both literal and metaphorical illumination. The atmosphere of isolation, danger, and cosmic wonder is consistently maintained through specific details like sky bridges and stone tables.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the physical (meteors, bridges) to illuminate the metaphysical (perseverance, defiance). The central paradox—that genuine caring sometimes requires the appearance of not caring—offers meaningful thematic depth. The ending achieves poignancy through its commitment to continuation rather than resolution. Some metaphors ("star-drunk darkness") are particularly striking, though a few moments slip into telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious AI markers like abrupt topic shifts or inconsistencies, the prose occasionally relies on somewhat abstract or general descriptions rather than specific, vivid details. The extended metaphor of apathy as armor feels familiar rather than wholly original. The emotional trajectory follows a relatively predictable arc, though the central paradox adds complexity that elevates it above formula.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that explores meaningful themes about perseverance and the nature of commitment. The floating monastery setting and meteor shower device work particularly well together. While the narrative occasionally relies on abstract statements rather than concrete scenes, it achieves a satisfying emotional resonance within its constraints.</comment>
