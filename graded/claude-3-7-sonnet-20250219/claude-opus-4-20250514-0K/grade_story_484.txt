<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed as a character wrestling with authenticity vs. commercialism. His central conflict of being "uniquely generic" shapes his actions and internal dialogue. His cynical self-awareness creates complexity, though his transformation feels slightly rushed. His voice is distinctive through sardonic observations like "how refreshingly unoriginal," revealing his worldview effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's existential crisis to his discovery of the original brewery, with clear causality and purposeful movement. The "initiate" action transitions smoothly from introspection to decision. The narrative arc is complete within the constraints, though the resolution feels somewhat hasty. The descent into the cellar effectively symbolizes his journey toward authenticity, creating meaningful narrative symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard brilliantly mirrors Marcus's internal state - both containing buried potential. Sensory details like "copper kettles green with patina" create immersive atmosphere. The juxtaposition of death imagery with creative rebirth effectively reinforces themes. The darkness functions both literally and metaphorically, and the timeframe of protest lulls creates a pocket of contemplative tension that enhances the setting's impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic depth through consistent metaphors of death/rebirth and authenticity/pretension. The mirror shard functions brilliantly as both literal object and symbol of reflection/truth. The central conflict between commercial success and artistic integrity resonates emotionally. The ending delivers a meaningful resolution without becoming simplistic. The brewing process itself becomes an effective extended metaphor for personal transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates originality in its treatment of common themes, avoiding predictable resolutions. Metaphors like "existential hangover" feel fresh rather than formulaic. The tone maintains consistency, successfully balancing cynicism with revelation. The protagonist's internal struggle shows nuanced emotional complexity beyond stated feelings. The story subverts expectations by finding authenticity in embracing, rather than rejecting, the fundamentals of brewing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with remarkable cohesion, making them feel essential rather than imposed. The mirror piece, graveyard setting, and brewing elements interweave thematically rather than functioning as separate checkboxes. The prose balances literary flourish with clarity. The brevity feels purposeful, creating a focused meditation on authenticity. The lingering question of whether Marcus will succeed in his new approach provides satisfying thematic resonance.</comment>
