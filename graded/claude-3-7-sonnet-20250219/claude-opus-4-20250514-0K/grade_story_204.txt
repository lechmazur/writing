<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's profession as a cuddler meaningfully informs her actions and perspective on connection. Her motivation to help the Fader despite ingrained prejudice is believable and emotionally resonant. However, we could delve deeper into her personal history with touch and connection to make her character truly exceptional. The Fader remains somewhat underdeveloped beyond his function in Maya's growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from chance encounter to meaningful connection, with the decay element creating natural tension. The arc is complete and satisfying within the word constraint, moving from prejudice to understanding through physical connection. The resolution delivers emotional catharsis without feeling rushed, though the "return to the farmer's market" conclusion veers slightly toward predictability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar functions brilliantly as both literal setting and metaphorical space, creating a liminal atmosphere that perfectly complements the interdimensional theme. The "cathedral of rust" and broken skylights painting patterns create vivid imagery that enhances the mood of sacred transition. The sensory details of holding "warm mist" are particularly effective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story skillfully explores themes of connection transcending boundaries, prejudice, and meaningful touch. The metaphorical resonance between professional cuddling and holding space for transitions adds depth. Literary devices like "phantom punch" create powerful symbolism. The emotional impact is genuine without becoming sentimental. The central conflict between ingrained fear and compassion resolves naturally through experience rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While generally avoiding AI-typical patterns, some phrases ("like a cathedral of rust," "like wind chimes in an empty house") feel slightly formulaic. The concept of interdimensional beings who fade is inventive, but the resolution follows a somewhat predictable "prejudice overcome through personal connection" arc. The emotional development feels authentic rather than stated, though certain transitions between thoughts could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that explores meaningful themes of connection across difference. The speculative fiction elements serve the emotional core rather than dominating it. The brevity works in its favor, creating a poignant moment rather than an extended narrative. What elevates this story is how it transforms the literal act of professional cuddling into a metaphor for human compassion and acceptance.</comment>
