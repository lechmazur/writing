<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's locksmith identity meaningfully informs her actions and mission, particularly in how she "works" metaphysical locks with physical skills. Her motivation to preserve indigenous dances feels genuine, though her emotional complexity could be further developed beyond the brief moments of laughter and hope. The grandmother apparition adds depth, but we lack insight into Lira's personal stakes beyond her professional identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively combines magical and concrete elements into a coherent narrative about cultural preservation. The progression from the falling leaf to the creation of the driftwood key to the liberation of the dances follows logical cause-and-effect. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and certain plot developments (like the yearbooks suddenly burning into fireflies) feel convenient rather than earned through established mechanics of this world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard creates a vivid liminal space perfectly suited to the story's theme of preservation amid erasure. Sensory details are exceptional—the groaning driftwood "like an old knee remembering rain," the chant that "tasted of burnt sugar and exile," and rain falling as "syllables of lost language" create a richly textured atmosphere where the physically metaphysical concept thrives naturally rather than feeling imposed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story employs striking imagery and metaphor throughout, particularly in its personification of secrets as dancers and its rendering of cultural memory as physical artifacts. The central theme of preserving what power structures seek to erase resonates strongly. However, the story occasionally prioritizes poetic language over narrative clarity, particularly in the middle section where the actual mechanics of Lira's preservation work become somewhat obscured beneath metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story features genuinely inventive imagery and metaphors—particularly in its treatment of the storm of secrets and the transformation of annotations into fireflies—certain phrases ("jaded wonder crystallized") lean toward purple prose. The narrative occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic effect. The concept is original, but the execution sometimes relies on familiar magical realism tropes without fully distinguishing its own voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a strong thematic core. The metaphor of locksmithing as cultural preservation is particularly effective. While occasionally prioritizing lyricism over clarity, the narrative maintains its emotional and thematic throughline. The ending achieves a satisfying balance of resolution and ongoing struggle that honors the complexity of its subject matter.</comment>
