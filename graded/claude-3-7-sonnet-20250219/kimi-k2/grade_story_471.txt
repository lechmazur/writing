<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is exceptionally well-developed within the constraint. Her motivation—mapping ghost towns to honor her vanished brother—drives every action with emotional authenticity. The "reckless hunter" attribute manifests organically through her willingness to venture alone into abandoned places. Her interactions with the musicians reveal vulnerability beneath determination. The only minor weakness is that we don't see enough personal growth or change beyond her realization about the nature of her mapping.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative flows with remarkable coherence despite its brevity. The opening promise establishes clear direction, and the progression from seeking physical locations to mapping "absences" creates a satisfying emotional arc. The conversations with musicians function perfectly as both method and plot advancement. The story achieves resolution through Mara's transformative understanding that she's "no longer hunting ghosts but carrying them gently." Causal relationships are consistently clear and meaningful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair setting is rendered with extraordinary sensory richness—"tasting rust and cotton candy ghosts," the accordion's wheeze, splintering tickets underfoot. The mist functions brilliantly as both literal atmosphere and metaphor for memory's haze. The setting perfectly amplifies the story's themes of absence and presence, decay and preservation. The contrast between the funfair's physical deterioration and its emotional resonance creates powerful tension throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of grief, memory, and the spaces left by absence. The central metaphor—mapping what is no longer there—is beautifully developed. The writing consistently shows rather than tells, particularly in how the lens "vibrated softly" and "warmed against her palm." The resolution offers genuine catharsis without simplistic closure. The theme of presence-in-absence is masterfully developed through rich symbolic language and the transformative power of art/music.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates remarkable originality in its treatment of grief and memory. Metaphors are consistently fresh ("atomize her guilt into something breathable"). The emotional landscape is rendered with authenticity rather than stated directly. There are occasional moments where the language becomes slightly overworked ("the map now singing in her step"), but these are rare exceptions in an otherwise distinctive voice. The story avoids predictable emotional beats and offers genuine insight into how we carry and transform loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion while incorporating all required elements naturally. The vintage camera lens, musicians, and abandoned funfair work in concert to explore themes of memory, absence, and artistic preservation. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with every sentence advancing character, plot, or atmosphere. The narrative leaves a powerful emotional resonance that extends beyond its conclusion, suggesting deeper meanings about how we preserve what is lost through art and memory.</comment>
