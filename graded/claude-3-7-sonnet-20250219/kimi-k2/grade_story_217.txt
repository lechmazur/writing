<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila is adequately developed as an underestimated rebel with artistic tendencies and a connection to the park, though her motivations remain somewhat surface-level. Her relationship with Mateo adds dimension but arrives late. The pocket knife functions as both tool and metaphor for her character, cleverly integrated, but deeper psychological complexity is missing. The character has potential but doesn't fully transcend her archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot effectively balances urgency (impending demolition) with transformation (breathing life into abandoned spaces). The journey through the haunted house creates clear forward movement, culminating in a meaningful connection and ritual before departure. However, the introduction of Mateo feels somewhat abrupt, and certain transitions between scenes could be smoother. The symbolic final act with the skeletal bride provides satisfying closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly realized through sensory detailsâ€”mildew and popcorn scents, fog rolling between skeletal coasters, broken carousel music. The juxtaposition of decay and renewal creates a compelling atmosphere that perfectly supports the theme of adaptation. The ephemeral gloom is consistently maintained while allowing moments of warmth to punctuate the setting, creating an immersive world that feels both ghostly and alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the haunted house as metaphor for memory and transformation. Strong imagery (blood-bright paint, mechanical raven as omen) elevates the narrative. The pocket knife serves as a versatile symbol of both destruction and creation. The final image of leaving tacos for ghosts while carrying forward memories creates poignant resonance. However, certain metaphors ("cotton candy ghosts") verge on precious, and the emotional climax could achieve greater depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, there's an overreliance on poetic constructions that occasionally sacrifice authenticity for lyricism. The sensory details are specific (chili-lime, cumin, charred pineapple), but some metaphors feel manufactured rather than organic. The character interactions have moments of genuine humanity, particularly around shared food memories, but certain transitions and emotional beats follow predictable patterns that suggest formula rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic resonance. The haunted amusement park setting perfectly complements themes of memory, adaptation and ephemeral beauty. While occasionally overwrought in its imagery, the story achieves a balance between literal plot (last night before demolition) and metaphorical meaning (preserving wonder amid ruins). The ending delivers emotional impact without sentimentality, leaving the reader with the lingering image of beauty refusing "to die quietly."</comment>
