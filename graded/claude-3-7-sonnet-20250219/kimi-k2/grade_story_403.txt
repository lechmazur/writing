<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's structure moves elegantly from isolation to revelation to transformation, with excellent cause-and-effect relationships throughout. The knight's action of seclusion perfectly drives the narrative toward its natural resolution.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating library creates a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly embodies the boundary between real and myth. Sensory details are exceptional—the taste of "joyful agony," the shell's "pink-veined" appearance, and the "spiral staircase of condensed starlight." The setting's transformation mirrors the character's journey, with the library's inversion creating a breathtaking moment where setting becomes revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves extraordinary impact through its rich symbolism and metaphors. The central theme—that miracles are "not rescues but returns, tiny loops of mercy insisting that loss could still be beautiful"—resonates profoundly. The story masterfully shows rather than tells, using the transformation of both setting and character to convey emotional truth. The image of armor falling "like petals" creates lasting impact, and the final line invites lingering reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its treatment of familiar fantasy elements.

While occasionally reaching toward complexity, the writing maintains authentic emotional resonance through specific, evocative details rather than stated feelings.</comment>
