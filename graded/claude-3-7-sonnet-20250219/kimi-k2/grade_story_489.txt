<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The unseen observer is effectively characterized through its non-corporeality ("had no hands") yet powerful presence, with consistent motivation throughout. Its "aggressively kind" attribute genuinely shapes its actions as it works to preserve tradition. However, the character lacks deeper complexity or internal conflict that would elevate it to literary excellence. The observer's relationship to the setting is well-established, but its backstory remains somewhat nebulous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure demonstrates remarkable coherence for such a brief piece, with the action of flinging the whistle's sound creating a clear cause-effect relationship that drives the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints: the observer identifies the forgotten tradition, acts through the whistle and whale call, and succeeds in transferring knowledge to the dancer. The pacing effectively builds tension before resolving into a sense of continuity and preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered with sensory details that evoke both its physical presence ("cracked glass," "floorboards creaked") and supernatural qualities. The atmosphere of hauntedness permeates every element, from the iron lantern that "remembered" to the dust and salt exhaled by the room itself. The setting perfectly complements both the ghostly observer and the theme of preserving traditions, while the juxtaposition of modern dancer and ancient lighthouse creates meaningful tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive depth through its layered symbolismâ€”the whistle as voice for the voiceless, the lighthouse as memory keeper, the whale as conduit between worlds. The central theme of rescuing cultural traditions from oblivion resonates emotionally. The writing employs effective literary techniques, particularly the recurring motif of the dancer's foot touching the stage. However, certain phrasings occasionally become too abstract, slightly diminishing immediate emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique perspective. However, some passages rely too heavily on poetic abstraction ("the undercurrent of wisdom braided past into present"), occasionally sacrificing clarity for lyricism. While the tone remains consistent, certain phrasings feel overly ornate ("the rescue of tradition trembling in her lifted ankle"). The story avoids major AI-writing hallmarks but occasionally slips into purple prose that diminishes authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its many assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The lighthouse setting, unseen observer, and dancer create a compelling triangulation that supports the theme of cultural preservation. The brevity works as a strength, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the supernatural elements. While occasionally veering toward overwritten passages, the story leaves readers with lingering questions about memory, tradition, and the ghostly witnesses of history.</comment>
