<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as an obituary writer for the living creates a compelling foundation for her motivation to preserve death-songs. Her consistently rebellious nature manifests authentically through her actions and the metaphor of her heart as "a caged bird." However, without dialogue or deeper personal history, we miss opportunities to understand the character's full complexity beyond her current mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc flows organically from discovery to understanding to resolution, with the protagonist's journey up and down the bookshelf providing physical structure that mirrors her emotional journey. The plot elements connect coherently through the central metaphor of preservation and memory. The conclusion feels earned, though the revolution subplot remains somewhat underdeveloped within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting creates a brilliant metaphorical landscape where knowledge, memory, and art exist in physical form. Exceptional sensory details like "humming resonance" that "tasted like copper and regret" and descriptions of "liquid starlight" establish a dreamlike yet tangible atmosphere. The setting perfectly amplifies the themes of preservation and rebellion against forgetting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates sophisticated metaphorical thinking throughout, particularly in equating books with tombstones and the mask's changing expressions with the protagonist's emotional journey. The central conflict between preservation and extinction resonates powerfully, with profound thematic exploration of art's resistance to death. The prose occasionally becomes slightly overwrought, but generally achieves a lyrical quality that serves the story's dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its central conceit and metaphorical framework. Phrases like "liquid starlight" and "frequency that tasted like copper and regret" show creative, specific imagery. However, certain lines like "the revolution would come" feel somewhat expected, and the emotional progression occasionally relies on stating rather than fully embodying the protagonist's transformations. The narrative voice remains consistent but could benefit from more distinctive stylistic markers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The central metaphor of preserving art against extinction creates emotional resonance that transcends the fantastical setting. While occasionally verging on overwrought in its imagery, the prose generally serves the story's aims well. The narrative achieves a satisfying conclusion that extends beyond itself, suggesting larger implications about art, memory, and resistance.</comment>
