<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner's motivation to outshine her reflection is well-established and consistent throughout. Her relationship with her grandmother's legacy creates meaningful psychological tension. The character's transformation from competitive rivalry to collaborative creation shows genuine development. However, her "voice" remains somewhat abstract rather than distinctively personal, keeping her slightly distant from the reader.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the demolition countdown as structural tension while maintaining excellent coherence between the opening and resolution. The transformation of destruction into creation provides a satisfying arc. The story skillfully connects familial traditions, quantum imagery, and personal growth into a cohesive narrative. However, the middle section could benefit from slightly clearer causality between the summoner's actions and the resulting transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quantum beach setting is exceptionally realized with vivid, original imagery that perfectly complements the themes of probability, transformation, and potential. The juxtaposition of demolition with creation creates powerful atmospheric tension. Sensory details like "probability waves lapped against rusted girders" and "Schr√∂dinger's tides" blend scientific concepts with emotional resonance in a masterful way that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional metaphorical depth, particularly in how it transforms destruction into creation and failure into potential. The shift from burning to planting creates a powerful thematic resolution. Literary devices around quantum mechanics serve the emotional core rather than feeling merely decorative. The ending resonates with genuine emotional impact. However, some passages rely on slightly abstract phrasing that prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its quantum imagery and its handling of reflection as both literal and metaphorical. The prose avoids AI-typical patterns and maintains consistent tone throughout. Metaphors are fresh and specific to the narrative world. However, occasional phrases like "corroded rapture made liquid" edge toward purple prose, and some emotional nuances could be shown with more specificity rather than described in abstract terms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, weaving them into a narrative where they feel essential rather than imposed. The quantum imagery serves the emotional and thematic core exceptionally well. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a concentrated, poetic experience. The final image of planting instead of burning provides a resonant conclusion that lingers beyond the narrative itself.</comment>
