<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's character is well-defined through her "sheepish spy" attribute, showing both vulnerability and determination. Her motivation to rescue forgotten promises is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout the narrative. The character demonstrates growth, transitioning from "sheepish" to confident by the end ("sheepish no longer"). However, her backstory as someone who "helped design the very filters" could have been more deeply integrated into her motivations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically despite its fantastical elements, with Lira's mission to unite forgotten promises driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints—from infiltration to transformation of the system. The cause-and-effect relationships are clear, with each action leading naturally to consequences. Particularly effective is how the beginning (infiltrating during naptime) connects to the end (promising to continue "one naptime at a time"), creating satisfying structural symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The pattern recognition center during naptime creates a perfect backdrop for clandestine activity, with blue screensaver constellations and sleeping analysts enhancing the dreamy, liminal atmosphere. The setting itself becomes metaphorical—a place where human wishes are algorithmically processed and forgotten. Sensory details like the lamp's refracting glow and the dragon's smoke "curling like question marks" create vivid imagery that reinforces the theme of illuminating forgotten promises.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of a dragon-code monster to represent an impersonal algorithm that "digests dreams." The central conflict—reclaiming human promises from an inhuman system—resonates emotionally while exploring themes of technological dehumanization and redemption. The lamp as both "gift and cage" works as a potent symbol. While the emotional stakes are clear, some metaphors occasionally verge on being too abstract, slightly reducing immediate impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fantastical approach to algorithmic ethics. The metaphor of promises as stained glass fragments feels fresh and purposeful. The narrative maintains consistent tone and style throughout. However, some phrasing occasionally becomes ornate ("dragon projected a hologram," "pixels of lost dreams streamed into the lamp"), and certain elements like the dragon's transformation feel somewhat expected once the story's metaphorical system is established.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The fantastical elements serve the underlying theme about technology's relationship to human promises. The brevity works as a strength, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the subject matter. The ending leaves readers with both resolution and a sense of ongoing mission, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative. Overall, it's a thoughtful exploration of human connection in an algorithmic world.</comment>
