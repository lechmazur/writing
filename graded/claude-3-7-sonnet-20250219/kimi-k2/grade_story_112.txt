<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is developed with remarkable consistency through her mission to preserve indigenous recipes. Her factually imaginative attribute manifests organically when she interprets the hopscotch patterns. However, we learn little about her backstory or internal complexity beyond her immediate mission, leaving some depth unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot builds logically from entry to archive through discovery, realization, and resolution. The grilling action and hopscotch pattern-noting method are integrated seamlessly into the narrative framework. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting future purpose. Some transitions between story beats could be more developed, but the constraints of length are handled skillfully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric crafting with richly sensory languageâ€”the taste of dust "like cedar and mourning," the "calligraphy" of smoke, and the "perfume" of erased alphabets. The archive setting perfectly complements the preservation theme, while the snowfall timeframe creates a poignant contrast between ephemeral beauty and enduring memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its exploration of cultural preservation as resistance. Powerful metaphors abound ("portable hearth," recipes "crackling like fresh tortillas"). The tension between loss and preservation creates a compelling thematic core. The story effectively shows rather than tells emotion, though some metaphors verge on overabundance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates considerable originality in its poetic approach to preservation and memory. Sensory details are specific and evocative rather than generic. While some metaphors ("tears blurred the ink") edge toward familiar territory, most descriptions feel fresh and purposeful. The consistent tone and emotional authenticity suggest genuine authorial voice rather than algorithmic patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive and emotionally resonant whole. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying narrative weight. The theme of cultural preservation through memory and ritual achieves both intellectual and emotional impact. A few passages border on excessive lyricism, but overall the craftsmanship demonstrates significant literary merit.</comment>
