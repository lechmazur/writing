<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as an overburdened clerk is effectively established through her desperate mission and emotional conflict. Her motivation to save her sister is compelling and drives her actions throughout. Her relationship with her grandfather (implied through the stamp collection) adds depth. However, we could benefit from more specific details about what makes her "overburdened" in her clerk role, as this aspect remains somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot moves seamlessly from setup to climax to resolution within the tight constraints. The quantum properties of the greenhouse, the arrangement of stamps as a ritual, and the ultimate sacrifice/choice create a complete arc with excellent cause-effect relationships. The concept of "quantizing grief" and weaving between worlds drives the plot organically. The story achieves a remarkable sense of completeness despite brevity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse setting is masterfully rendered with sensory details that create a vivid, otherworldly atmosphere. The juxtaposition of filtered sunlight, whale song, and bioluminescent coral creates a rich sensory landscape. The setting perfectly supports the concept of existing "between spaces" and enhances the magical/scientific hybrid tone. The timeframe of "an ephemeral pause" is brilliantly integrated into both setting and plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional and intellectual depth through its layered symbolism. The stamps of extinct species create powerful metaphors about loss and preservation. The central conflict between personal love and greater good is profound, and the resolution through self-sacrifice/dispersal is both surprising and satisfying. The prose demonstrates excellent craft with evocative imagery and meaningful subtext about the nature of choice and existence across multiple timelines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates genuine originality in its approach to parallel universes and quantum properties. The writing avoids formulaic patterns with fresh metaphors and unique concepts like "quantizing grief." While some phrases like "wasting disease turning lungs to glass" verge on purple prose, they generally serve the narrative's dreamlike quality. The emotional core feels authentic rather than algorithmic, with nuanced handling of Mara's impossible choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous complex elements. The assigned components feel intrinsic to the narrative rather than forced. The brief length feels deliberate, creating a concentrated emotional impact. The lingering image of Mara dispersed across timelines, preserved in growing stamps, provides a powerful conclusion that resonates beyond the text. A sophisticated blend of science fiction concepts with emotional depth.</comment>
