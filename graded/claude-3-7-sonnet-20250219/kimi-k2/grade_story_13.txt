<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The solemn swordsman is effectively characterized through his actions and internal states rather than explicit description. His guarded breathing, reluctance to feel emotion since the war, and his journey to vulnerability create a compelling arc. His acceptance of being "functionally dysfunctional" and transformation from warrior to caretaker show meaningful development. However, his backstory remains somewhat vague, which limits the full emotional impact of his transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured around the poems that guide the swordsman's journey, creating a clear progression with meaningful cause-and-effect relationships. The narrative moves coherently from entrance to revelation to transformation, with the seed's planting serving as both climax and resolution. The arc from carrying a box with a seed to planting it in a garden of self-discovery is complete and satisfying within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally well-realized, with the toppled clock tower's frozen gears and shattered rose window creating a liminal space where time and transformation intersect. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful—the smell of rust and roses, the mercury-like pooling of time. The atmosphere of decay and renewal perfectly complements the swordsman's journey and the garden wisdom concept, with the shifting sands erasing retreat serving as both physical detail and metaphorical reinforcement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its interweaving of evocative imagery and thematic resonance. The central metaphor of planting grief to grow renewal is powerfully executed through the garden imagery. Literary devices—particularly the personification of the poems as "captive moths" and the garden unfolding "like a book of hours"—create rich subtext. The final poem's revelation that "growth is surrender to what wounds you" offers a profound thematic culmination that resonates beyond the story itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates considerable originality in its fusion of fantasy elements with philosophical introspection. The imagery is fresh and specific, particularly in lines like "petals opening into eyes" and "roots cracked the box apart." The narrative avoids predictable patterns by transforming the typical hero's journey into an internal quest. The only weakness is occasional over-reliance on poetic phrasing that, while beautiful, sometimes prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story achieves an impressive cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each component feels essential rather than forced, particularly the integration of the wooden box, poems, and garden as physical manifestations of the character's emotional journey. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying multiple layers of meaning. The final image of the swordsman planting his blade leaves readers with a lingering meditation on surrender as strength rather than weakness.</comment>
