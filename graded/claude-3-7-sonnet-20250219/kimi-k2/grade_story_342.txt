<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira is well-established through her carelessness and dreaminess, with her motivation to escape borrowed memories being psychologically complex. Her relationship with the navigator's glove creates meaningful emotional tension. However, we don't see enough of her internal struggle or backstory to fully understand her acceptance of her fate, which limits our emotional investment in her character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a strong arc from Lira's entrance to her realization and acceptance of her fate. The postcards, borrowed memories, and orchard labyrinth create a cohesive narrative loop that effectively conveys causality. The cyclical nature of the plot—pilots crashing to pass on memories to future wanderers—is elegantly established within the word constraint. The resolution feels inevitable rather than forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The twisted orchard labyrinth creates a dreamlike, liminal space perfectly matched to the story's themes. The timeframe between thunder and rain establishes tension and creates a threshold feeling. Sensory details like rain spotting ink, the leather tightening, and thunder rolling closer immerse the reader in this uncanny setting. The Möbius loops and cockpit-shaped hollow brilliantly merge the aviation and natural worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves profound impact through its layered symbolism—the orchard as archive of crashes, postcards as prophecies, and the glove as conduit between pilots. The cyclical narrative creates a haunting meditation on fate, memory, and sacrifice. Literary devices like "memories fluttered inside her skull like trapped starlings" elevate the prose. The ending achieves emotional resonance through its bittersweet acceptance and the image of the waiting glove.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its concept of an orchard archiving future crashes. The prose avoids clichés with fresh metaphors and unexpected sensory details. The writing maintains a consistent dreamlike tone without becoming purple prose. Particularly strong is the handling of the surreal elements—making them feel logically consistent rather than random. Minor weakness: some sentences become slightly overwrought in their complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite juggling multiple complex elements. The central metaphor of archiving memories through crashes creates a haunting meditation on fate and sacrifice. The assigned elements feel essential rather than forced, with the glove, postcards, and orchard creating a unified symbolic system. The brevity works as a strength, giving the piece the feeling of a vivid, concentrated dream that lingers after reading.</comment>
