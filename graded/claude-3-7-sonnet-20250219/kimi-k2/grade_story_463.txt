<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is well-established and consistent throughout the narrative. His character reveals depth through his approach to tradition and duty, especially in the poignant moment when his wit "cracks like ice under spring's first thaw." His motivation becomes increasingly clear as we understand his role in releasing spirits. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into his personal stakes in this particular haunting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot structure elegantly connects the crossing of the final name with the release of both keeper and wife. The confiscation of the rope serves as a perfect catalyst for this resolution. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the action of confiscating the rope leading organically to the keeper's release. The pacing feels masterful, with each revelation building toward the emotionally resonant conclusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is rendered with exceptional atmospheric detail—salt-stained glass, dusty floorboards, the perpetual fog—all working harmoniously with the ghostly timeframe. The physical rope brilliantly embodies both literal bondage and metaphorical promise. Sensory details like the "scratchy gramophone" and moonlight filtering through windows create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that perfectly supports the story's themes of duty, promise, and release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable emotional impact through its layered symbolism—the rope as both physical object and metaphor for binding promises, the tango representing connection beyond death. The story masterfully shows rather than tells, particularly in the final image of shadows dancing and the couple reuniting across waves. The central conflict between duty and desire resolves with poetic justice, and the theme of knowing when to honor versus break tradition resonates profoundly beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive originality in its approach to ghost stories and promises. The metaphors are consistently fresh ("dry wit cracking like ice") and specific to this narrative world. While occasionally the prose risks becoming too ornate ("reckless precision of a man who'd watched too many promises erode like cliff faces"), it generally maintains authenticity through consistent tone and emotional nuance. The interweaving of dance, duty, and death creates a distinctive narrative voice that transcends formulaic ghost story conventions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements—each one feels essential rather than forced. The rope, the lighthouse, the dance, and the list of names all interlock with precision to serve the central theme of promises and release. The brevity feels deliberate and powerful, with the story leaving lingering questions about duty, love, and the nature of promises that transcend death. The final image of the couple dancing across waves delivers emotional resonance that extends well beyond the narrative's conclusion.</comment>
