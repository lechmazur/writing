<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias Finch is effectively characterized as an intellectual pursuing mystical knowledge, his amiability subtly demonstrated through his approach to supernatural phenomena. His scholarly nature drives his actions consistently, especially in his methodical handling of the crossword puzzle. However, we get limited insight into his deeper personal history or emotional complexity, leaving some aspects of his characterization somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains excellent coherence with a clear arc - from Elias entering the lighthouse to completing his mission and departing at dawn. The crossword puzzle as catalyst creates tension, and the vibrating timbers provide compelling conflict. The fusion of ancient myths with modern codes drives the narrative purposefully to a satisfying resolution. The pacing feels well-managed, though the exact stakes could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is rendered with exceptional atmospheric detail - from the cold brass speaking-tube to shadows "pooled like spilled ink" and the Fresnel lens. The integration of the Hesperus shipwreck into the physical structure creates a compelling connection between setting and supernatural elements. Sensory details are vivid and evocative, particularly the visual and tactile impressions that immerse the reader in this liminal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs symbolism and metaphor, particularly in how the crossword represents the bridging of past and future. The lighthouse as threshold between "rescue and ruin" offers meaningful subtext about knowledge and preservation. The narrative shows rather than tells, especially in moments of supernatural revelation. The ending provides both closure and expansiveness, suggesting transformation beyond the immediate story. The prose is poetic without becoming purple.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central conceit of using a crossword puzzle as a mystical conduit. The lighthouse setting avoids clich√© through specific, unusual details like the speaking-tube and the incorporated shipwreck timbers. The prose maintains consistent style throughout without formulaic transitions. Occasional phrases like "humble rebellion" are repeated, but purposefully as thematic reinforcement rather than limitation. The emotional resonance feels authentic rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, atmospheric tale that feels complete despite its brevity. The supernatural elements and scholarly protagonist create effective tension, while the lighthouse setting is richly realized. The fusion of ancient and modern themes provides depth beyond the surface narrative. The prose occasionally verges on overwritten but generally maintains an elegant balance between lyricism and clarity. The ending leaves a lingering sense of transformation and possibility.</comment>
