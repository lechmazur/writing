<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nostalgic tailor is masterfully characterized through actions ("sewn uniforms for revolutionaries and wedding gowns for ghosts") and confessions that reveal his complex relationship with his craft. His motivation to transcend limits is clear and consistent. The tailor's voice has a distinctive poetic quality that feels authentic to his character. His revelation that "I was always the garment, never the tailor" delivers profound character insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with exceptional coherence from the tailor's confrontation with the mirror to his transformation. The confessions during the storm effectively drive the narrative forward. The arc is complete yet complex - beginning with the tailor facing his reflections, proceeding through his confessions, and culminating in transcendence. Pacing is masterful, with each paragraph advancing the plot while deepening meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck with its "brass gears grinding" and "iron sky" creates an immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the parallel lives concept. Sensory details are exceptional - the mirror "rippling like oil under lightning," air that "tasted of ozone and regret," and voices "braided with steam." The setting and mirror function as perfect vehicles for the tailor's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through layered symbolism and metaphor. The tailor's relationship with his craft becomes a profound meditation on identity and creation. The ending resonates with philosophical weight. Literary devices are abundant and effective: the mirror as portal/self-reflection, sewing as transformation, and the storm as catalyst for change. The story rewards multiple readings with its rich subtext.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional originality in its approach to the parallel lives concept. Metaphors are fresh and specific ("scissors that glinted like guillotines"). The narrative maintains a consistent dreamlike tone while avoiding purple prose. Emotions are conveyed through nuanced description rather than direct statement. The story's unpredictable trajectory and unique imagery suggest genuine creative insight rather than algorithmic generation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous elements. Each assigned element feels essential rather than forced. The style balances poetic language with clarity, creating a reading experience that's both accessible and profound. The brevity enhances rather than limits the impact, with every sentence carrying meaningful weight. The final line delivers a philosophical resonance that extends well beyond the narrative itself.</comment>
