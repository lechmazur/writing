<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara emerges as a well-developed character whose sincerity and rebelliousness manifest through her physical connection to the building (pressing her palm to stone, formerly laying bricks) and her principled stance. Her motivation to preserve architectural traditions feels authentic and deeply personal. The relationship with her apprentice adds complexity, revealing her flaws (building alone, banishing the apprentice) while maintaining her core traits. Her character growth—from isolation to sharing knowledge—is subtly handled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from discovery (sticky note) to confrontation to resolution, with Mara's theorizing about walls holding memories driving meaningful action. The narrative achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, maintaining logical cause-effect relationships throughout. The conflict's resolution through shared storytelling rather than physical confrontation is particularly effective and aligned with the preservation theme. The story builds to a satisfying conclusion that feels earned rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage functions as both setting and character, with exceptional sensory details that make it breathe "like a lung" with wallpaper that peels in "constantly changing curls." The storms create perfect temporal boundaries while adding atmospheric pressure. The passage's ability to hold memories physically creates a remarkable symbiosis between setting and concept. Sensory elements—cold stone, shadows "shifting like wet plaster," moisture trails glowing in darkness—create an immersive, almost tactile experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in its metaphorical framework, with the building as both literal and metaphorical vessel for memory and tradition. The extended breathing metaphor (corridor as lung, east wing as diaphragm) creates a cohesive symbolic structure. The resolution—preserving through storytelling rather than physical means—offers profound commentary on how traditions survive. The final image of builders turning back because "the house was listening" delivers emotional and thematic satisfaction while maintaining the story's established logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its approach to hauntings, with the apprentice manifesting not as typical ghost but as "echo" and "witness." The prose avoids generic patterns through specific, craft-oriented details ("keystone sings when set just right") and architectural terminology that feels knowledgeable rather than researched. The emotional progression—from "braided bitterness" to "grief and resolve"—shows nuanced understanding of complex emotions. The conceptual framework of buildings holding memories feels fresh and internally consistent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous elements. The building-as-body metaphor creates a unifying framework where all elements—from the torn sticky note to the storms—serve the central themes of preservation and tradition. The prose balances lyrical qualities with clarity, maintaining consistent tone throughout. Most impressively, the story transforms its fantastical elements into a meditation on how knowledge and tradition survive through generations, giving it resonance beyond its immediate narrative.</comment>
