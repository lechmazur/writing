<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is mentioned but barely demonstrated, making this trait feel superficial. His motivation to preserve tradition is stated rather than revealed through meaningful actions. While there's a clear goal (honoring the lighthouse's history), the character lacks depth and distinctive voice. The emotional shift during the dance hints at complexity but remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—from completing a list to restoring the lighthouse through ritual dance—but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing. The connection between the frayed rope, the waltz, and restoring promises creates an interesting framework, though the cause-effect relationships feel somewhat forced. The pacing works adequately within the word limit, but the resolution comes too easily, diminishing tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is effectively atmospheric and well-integrated with the concept of eroding promises. The groaning lighthouse, moonlight through grimy windows, and the spectral presence create a cohesive mood that enhances the story's supernatural elements. However, more specific sensory details would strengthen immersion—the physical space remains somewhat generic despite its potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of tradition, promises, and restoration, but relies too heavily on explicit statements rather than subtextual development. The rope's transformation from frayed to whole provides a satisfying visual metaphor, but the emotional impact is diminished by overly declarative language. The conflict resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through meaningful character struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: repetitive phrasing around "promises" and "tradition," overly formal language, and explicitly stated emotions rather than demonstrated ones. The metaphors lack freshness ("the lighthouse groaned as if sighing"), and the narrative follows a predictable redemption arc. The prose becomes purple in places ("reckless precision," "ethereal light") without the specificity that would make these descriptions meaningful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story successfully incorporates all assigned elements, it does so at the expense of authentic character development and narrative tension. The supernatural premise has potential, but the execution relies too heavily on telling rather than showing. The lighthouse setting creates atmosphere, but the story lacks the specificity and emotional nuance that would elevate it beyond its formulaic structure. The ending, while thematically consistent, feels too neat given the ghostly premise.</comment>
