<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's character is established through his profession and contradictory nature (rationally impulsive), but his development remains superficial. His motivation to preserve stories through performance is clear, yet his emotional journey lacks nuance. The character feels more like a vehicle for the concept than a fully realized individual with internal conflicts or growth. His relationship with the tattered dress is symbolic but doesn't reveal enough psychological depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot structure suffers from excessive summarization rather than scene development. While there's a clear arc—finding the dress, investigating its stories, and performing them—the narrative lacks specific incidents or complications that would create genuine tension. The cold-case mystery solving method is mentioned but never shown in action. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The post-oil world and reimagined Chinese palace create an intriguing setting with strong visual elements. The interplay of light through debris effectively establishes atmosphere and serves as a metaphor for uncovering hidden stories. However, the world-building lacks specific sensory details beyond visual imagery, and the practical realities of this post-extraction society remain unexplored, limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with abstract statements about "emotional honesty" and "theatrical deception" instead of demonstrating these concepts through specific scenes. The central metaphor of light filtering through debris has potential but becomes repetitive. The story lacks a concrete antagonistic force or meaningful obstacles for the protagonist to overcome, resulting in minimal tension and a predictable resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The prose exhibits several AI hallmarks: repetitive phrasing ("anxious serenity" appears multiple times), overly formal language, abstract emotional descriptions rather than specific reactions, and a tendency toward flowery generalizations. The narrative feels formulaic, with predictable progression and little surprise. The writing lacks a distinctive voice or stylistic fingerprint, instead employing generic literary flourishes that don't serve character or plot development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all assigned elements, it fails to develop them into a compelling narrative with emotional resonance. The concept has potential—an actor using found objects to recreate lost stories in a post-apocalyptic setting—but execution relies on summary and abstraction rather than concrete scenes and specific details. The brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, with the story attempting to cover too much ground without sufficient depth.</comment>
