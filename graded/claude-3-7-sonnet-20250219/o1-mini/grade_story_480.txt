<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist lacks depth beyond her assigned role. While her motivation to connect people is stated, we don't see her internal struggles or growth. The character remains a concept rather than a fully realized person with emotional complexity. Her "indifferent enthusiasm" is repeatedly mentioned but never demonstrated through meaningful actions or reactions that would reveal her humanity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks coherent progression and causality. While the concept of exorcising social media personas is intriguing, the actual mechanics remain vague. The story presents a series of statements about the character's mission without showing the specific challenges she faces or how she overcomes them. The narrative reads more like a description of a concept than a story with rising action, conflict, and resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric elements show promise but lack specificity. The abandoned mess hall and music hall create an intriguing urban backdrop, but sensory details are minimal. The "quietly loud" atmosphere is an interesting contradiction that could have been more fully explored through concrete sensory experiences rather than just stated. The alleyways and secret clubs remain generic rather than vividly realized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, with abstract concepts repeatedly stated instead of dramatized. The potentially rich metaphor of social media exorcism remains underdeveloped. While there's an attempt at thematic depth regarding digital disconnection, the execution lacks the specificity and emotional resonance needed to make these ideas impactful. The ending feels predetermined rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: repetitive phrasing (particularly around "indifferent enthusiasm"), abstract rather than concrete descriptions, and a structure that feels like variations on a theme rather than organic development. The writing lacks a distinctive voice or style, instead defaulting to somewhat generic, formal language. Emotional states are stated rather than revealed through specific actions or reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>While the concept of a social media exorcist has potential, the execution lacks the specificity and emotional depth needed for literary impact. The assigned elements feel more like checkboxes than integrated components of a cohesive narrative. The abstract, telling-heavy approach creates distance rather than immersion, and the character's journey lacks the concrete obstacles and meaningful transformations that would make it resonant.</comment>
