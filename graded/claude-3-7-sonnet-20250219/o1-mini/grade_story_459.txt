<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's character has a clear motivation and his ghostly visions shape his actions, but his development feels somewhat superficial. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute appears sporadically rather than being consistently integrated into his personality. While the flower crown symbolism works, his emotional journey lacks sufficient depth and nuance to make him fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot structure suffers from a rushed resolution and underdeveloped causality. While there is a beginning, middle, and end, the connections between events feel tenuous. The "dissecting silence" action doesn't drive the plot forward with sufficient clarity, and the staking out of ghost tours method feels underutilized. The climactic encounter with the sorrowful ghost arrives abruptly without adequate buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates an intriguing juxtaposition with the ghostly elements, and the lunch break timeframe effectively establishes a liminal space. However, sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion. The atmosphere successfully conveys melancholy and contemplation, but lacks the richness and specificity needed to fully transport the reader into this unique setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of letting go and bridging worlds, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing these concepts. The flower crown symbolism works effectively, but other literary devices feel underdeveloped. The emotional impact is diluted by overly formal language and a resolution that feels too neat given the complexity of the premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: overly formal phrasing, abrupt narrative transitions, and explicitly stated emotions rather than nuanced emotional development. The prose often becomes unnecessarily ornate ("the dissonance of silence that enveloped the lab"), and character reasoning lacks human complexity. The story follows a predictable emotional arc without the surprising insights or unique perspective that would mark truly original work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the story incorporates all required elements, they often feel like constraints rather than organic components of the narrative. The brevity works against developing the complex premise fully. Though there are moments of genuine poignancy, particularly in the ghost encounter, the overall execution lacks the cohesion, depth, and stylistic assurance needed for high-caliber literary publication.</comment>
