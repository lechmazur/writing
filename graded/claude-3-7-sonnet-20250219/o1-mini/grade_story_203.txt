<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evelyn's characterization as an exorcist with stage fright has potential but remains underdeveloped. Her motivation to confront family lies is stated rather than shown through meaningful actions or internal struggle. The pressed wildflowers serve as a symbolic object but their significance to her character isn't fully explored. Her transformation from fearful to courageous feels rushed and lacks the necessary psychological depth to be convincing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot structure suffers from vague causality and insufficient development of the central conflict. While there is a basic arc (confrontation of lies leading to liberation), the mechanics of how the exorcism actually works remain unclear. The key-turning method is mentioned but its connection to resolving the inheritance of lies isn't logically established. The story attempts to create a complete arc but rushes through crucial plot points without adequate explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting creates an intriguing atmosphere of isolation and fragmentation that effectively mirrors Evelyn's internal state. The juxtaposition with toy assembly creates an interesting contrast between creation and destruction. However, the sensory details are limited, with minimal description of how the space station looks, sounds, or feels beyond occasional mentions of clanging and hushed tones. The setting has potential but isn't fully realized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with its exploration of confronting inherited deception, but relies too heavily on abstract statements rather than concrete demonstration. The metaphors (ashes of "never," sculpting possibility) feel disconnected from the actual events. While there's emotional potential in Evelyn's journey, the impact is diminished by telling rather than showing her transformation. The ending aims for profundity but lacks the earned emotional resonance to deliver it effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The writing exhibits several hallmarks of AI-generated text: abstract emotional states rather than specific reactions, overly formal language ("the inheritance of lies had been transformed into a foundation for newfound hope"), repetitive phrasing, and reliance on telling rather than showing. The prose becomes purple in places with phrases like "submerged herself in the possibility she had sculpted." Character reasoning lacks human nuance, and the narrative follows a predictable emotional arc without surprising developments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>While the story attempts to weave together disparate elements into a cohesive whole, it struggles to create a narrative where these elements feel essential rather than obligatory. The brevity results in underdeveloped concepts and relationships. The central metaphor of exorcising family lies has potential, but the execution relies too heavily on abstract statements rather than concrete, emotionally resonant scenes. The story gestures toward depth without fully achieving it.</comment>
