<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The exorcist's character is moderately developed through his nervousness, determination, and internal conflict between faith and science. His inwardly social nature creates interesting tension with his solitary quest. However, his personality lacks deeper nuance and his "coy aggression" feels inconsistently portrayed rather than integrated into a coherent character portrait. His motivation to bridge science and the supernatural is clear but would benefit from more personal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The puzzle-solving structure creates effective forward momentum with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The three-part puzzle sequence builds tension well, and the resolution maintains the story's thematic integrity by leaving questions unanswered. The plot achieves a satisfying arc despite the constraint of being told in single-sentence paragraphs. However, the pacing accelerates too quickly in the middle, rushing through puzzle solutions that could have been more deliberately revealed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The psychic research facility creates an effective backdrop that inherently tensions science against faith. The contrast between the sterile institutional setting and the supernatural elements creates compelling dissonance. The dance lessons add an unexpected and effective counterpoint that enhances the feeling of two worlds colliding. Sensory details like the smell of "dust and desperation" and walls that "pulsed with energy" create vivid atmosphere that supports the thematic exploration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the tension between empirical evidence and faith, using the exorcist's quest as a metaphor for bridging seemingly incompatible worldviews. The central conflict between measurable reality and supernatural mystery creates meaningful stakes. Literary techniques like the burning postcard and the facility "holding its breath" elevate the prose. The ending achieves poignancy through its acknowledgment that the pursuit itself holds value. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by occasional abstraction rather than specific, visceral detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids obvious AI markers like logic leaps or inconsistencies, and maintains a consistent tone. However, some phrases feel formulaic ("a testament to those who'd tried to bridge the gap") and certain descriptions rely on telling rather than showing emotional states. The sentence structure becomes repetitive, with many beginning with the subject performing an action. While the core concept is fresh, the execution occasionally falls into predictable patterns of supernatural investigation stories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic resonance. The concept of bridging science and supernatural is handled with nuance, and the emotional undercurrent of doubt and determination feels authentic. The constraint of single-sentence paragraphs is well-managed. However, some elements like "coy aggression" feel forced rather than organic to the story, and greater variation in sentence structure would strengthen the prose. The lingering questions effectively invite reader contemplation beyond the final line.</comment>
