<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liam's character is effectively shaped by his ghost-seeing burden, with clear motivation to understand and potentially release these spirits. His connection to the ghost with the flower crown reveals emotional depth. His clumsiness physically manifests his internal turmoil. However, we could benefit from more specific details about his past relationship with the ghost to fully understand his emotional journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from Liam's ghost encounters to the climactic moment with the flower crown ghost and his subsequent emotional release. The action of dissecting ghost stories drives his character development effectively. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with a satisfying resolution that shows his transformation from burdened to unburdened. The pacing allows enough space for both tension and resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a compelling metaphor for Liam's attempts to preserve memories that should perhaps be released. Sensory details are strong, particularly the "sterile air," "hum" of the lab, and the tactile qualities of sand and dried flowers. The setting and the concept of "dissonance of silence" work harmoniously to create a melancholic yet ultimately hopeful atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the preservation of sand castles as a metaphor for Liam's inability to let go of the past. There's strong thematic coherence around impermanence and acceptance. The emotional arc feels authentic and earned. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution while maintaining some ambiguity. The imagery of crumbling petals mirroring the fragility of sand castles is particularly effective. However, the ghost's motivation could be more clearly defined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with consistent tone and nuanced emotional portrayal. There are fresh metaphors like the spilled adhesive mirroring his emotional chaos. However, some phrases feel slightly formulaic ("the weight of memory," "threads in the tapestry of his life"), and the ending relies somewhat on expected emotional resolution tropes. The ghost's appearance and disappearance could benefit from more specific, unique details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about grief and acceptance. The sand castle preservation lab serves as both literal setting and metaphorical framework. The brief length feels appropriate for the emotional arc. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about the nature of Liam's relationship with the ghost and the significance of letting go, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
