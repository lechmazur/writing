<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The necromancer's meekness and sincerity come through clearly, and his motivation to solve the riddle remains consistent. However, his character lacks specificity—we learn about his quest but little about him as a person. His transformation from seeking control to embracing surrender is meaningful but would benefit from more personal details that distinguish him from any generic seeker of wisdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—from seeking answers in the tapestry to finding wisdom in letting go. The action of "regaining" drives the story effectively as the necromancer recovers not what he initially sought but something more valuable. The narrative flows logically as the revelation builds through his observation of dew drops, though the resolution feels somewhat abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The underground goblin city with its cavern walls and prismatic light creates a richly atmospheric setting. The contrast between the serious necromancer and the playful goblin environment works effectively. Sensory details—like light bending through dew drops and ink seeping into fabric—create an immersive, mystical atmosphere that enhances the theme of hidden connections and unexpected revelations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tapestry as a metaphor for life's interconnectedness, with strong imagery of light, reflection, and threads. The thematic shift from seeking to control to embracing surrender offers genuine depth. The ending satisfies by resolving the character's internal conflict. However, the abstract nature of the "universal riddle" leaves the reader with less concrete impact than a more specific revelation might provide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids the most obvious AI pitfalls but occasionally slips into overly ornate language that feels more performative than purposeful. While the metaphor of the tapestry is well-developed, phrases like "the real magic lay in surrendering to the flow of existence" edge toward philosophical platitudes rather than fresh insights. The emotional arc is genuine but could benefit from more specific, less abstract realizations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The necromancer's journey from seeking control to embracing surrender creates emotional resonance within the brief format. However, the abstract nature of both the quest and its resolution, while intentional, limits the story's impact compared to what more concrete specificity might achieve. Nevertheless, it leaves readers with meaningful contemplation about finding wisdom in unexpected places.</comment>
