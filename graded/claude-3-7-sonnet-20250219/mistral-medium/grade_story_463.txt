<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dry-witted sentinel has a distinctive presence, with his wit described as "a blade wrapped in velvet," but his deeper motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped. His determination to "reclaim what had been lost" is established, but the specifics of what was lost and why he cares remain vague. His character has potential but lacks the complexity and fully realized emotional depth that would make him truly compelling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc—from confronting ghosts to reclaiming something lost—but suffers from ambiguity about what specifically is at stake. The action of confiscating the rope drives the story forward, yet the consequences and significance remain abstract. While the connection between beginning and end exists through the transformation of the frayed rope to whole, the narrative feels more atmospheric than plot-driven, leaving key questions about causality unanswered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details of "salt and regret" and creates a powerful atmosphere that enhances the themes of isolation and memory. The lighthouse beam cutting through fog serves as both literal element and metaphor for revelation. The setting and the ghostly inhabitants merge seamlessly, creating a liminal space where past and present, physical and supernatural effectively coexist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively employs symbolism, particularly with the frayed rope representing broken promises and relationships, and the lighthouse beam as guidance. The prose has moments of striking imagery ("voice like the wind through broken glass"). However, the central conflict remains somewhat abstract, and the emotional impact is diluted by metaphorical language that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the core narrative tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers like topic switching or inconsistent characterization, it occasionally relies on somewhat generic metaphors and abstract statements rather than specific, concrete details that would ground the supernatural elements. The prose sometimes veers toward being ornate ("a reckless precision of steps and sighs"), and the emotional core of what exactly was lost or promised feels underdeveloped beneath the atmospheric language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a haunting atmosphere and creates intrigue through its metaphorical treatment of promises, memory, and redemption. The assigned elements are generally well-integrated, particularly the lighthouse setting and the frayed rope. However, the story would benefit from greater specificity about the sentinel's motivations and the nature of the "promises" at its core, which would transform it from an intriguing mood piece to a more emotionally resonant narrative.</comment>
