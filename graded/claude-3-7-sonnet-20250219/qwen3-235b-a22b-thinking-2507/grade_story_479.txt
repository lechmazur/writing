<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The character of Celeste is well-developed through her actions and the family legacy she carries. Her glamorous undertaker persona is consistent and authentic, with details like emerald silk gloves and stiletto heels reinforcing her aesthetic while contrasting with her sacred duty. Her motivation—preserving the stories of the deceased—is clear and emotionally resonant. However, her internal conflict could be more deeply explored, and her "fruitlessly patient" attribute, while present, feels somewhat underdeveloped compared to other character elements.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively centers on Celeste's act of elongating the archive room while honoring her family tradition. The brass measuring tape serves as both practical tool and symbolic link to her ancestors. While the narrative achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints, the action of mixing paint sometimes overshadows the more meaningful elongation process. The cause-and-effect relationships are clear, but the plot could benefit from slightly stronger narrative tension to drive the story forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is richly rendered and thoughtfully integrated with the timeframe of paint mixing. The juxtaposition of digital preservation with physical renovation creates a compelling atmosphere that bridges past and present. Sensory details—cerulean fumes, flickering fluorescents, the cool weight of brass—immerse the reader effectively. The atmosphere perfectly supports the theme of preserving what society deems forgettable, with the ochre and sunset hues of paint symbolically mirroring the archive's purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates sophisticated craft through consistent symbolism and metaphor. The brass tape becomes a potent symbol for measuring and extending lives beyond death. The emotional impact is substantial, evoking reflection on memory, legacy, and what makes a life significant. The central conflict between preservation and inevitable loss creates meaningful tension. The theme of fighting "the myth of ordinariness" emerges organically and resonates throughout. However, the ending, while poetic, could deliver a slightly stronger final emotional punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its premise and execution. The concept of a glamorous undertaker preserving digital footprints feels fresh. However, some language occasionally verges on purple prose with phrases like "jubilant remorse burning in her chest" that feel slightly overwrought. The non-English characters (逝者的, 逝者, 刻痕) appear abruptly and without clear contextual integration, creating jarring moments that break immersion. The emotional nuance is generally well-handled, though occasionally emotions are stated rather than fully shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its many assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinct voice and atmosphere. The brass measuring tape, paint mixing, and digital archive work in harmony to support the central theme about preserving ordinary lives. The brief length feels deliberate rather than constraining, allowing for rich imagery and thematic development. The story leaves readers with lingering questions about digital legacy and memory that extend beyond the narrative itself. Minor issues with occasional overwrought language and the integration of non-English characters prevent it from achieving a higher score.</comment>
