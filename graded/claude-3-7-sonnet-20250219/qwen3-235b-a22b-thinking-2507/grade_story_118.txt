<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris Thorne has a distinct role and personality that emerges through their actions and emotional responses. The character's motivation to anchor ephemeral trauma is consistent and shapes their methodical approach. However, their inner life lacks some depth - we understand what they do but get limited insight into their history or personal stakes beyond professional duty. The connection to the scuffed charger as a personal tether is intriguing but could be more deeply integrated into their characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from problem (volatile psychic residue) to resolution (breakthrough signal) within the word limit. The draining action drives the narrative forward logically. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract - we understand the importance intellectually but the consequences of failure aren't viscerally felt. The cause-effect relationship between the wax symbols and the hive-mind is established but would benefit from more concrete explanation of how this mechanism actually works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The secret agent facility creates an effectively eerie atmosphere enhanced by sensory details like the "low thrum" and "sterile corridors." The uniformly peculiar lighting and hum create a distinct mood that complements the esoteric nature of hive-mind therapy. The contrast between the clinical setting and the organic, ancient method of wax dripping creates compelling tension. The dawn timeframe effectively frames the story as a threshold moment between darkness and revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story creates intrigue through its unique premise and esoteric methodology. The wax-dripping as a physical manifestation of psychic phenomena is original and visually compelling. The theme of anchoring the intangible in tangible reality provides depth. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, and while the story shows rather than tells Aris's methods, it occasionally tells emotional states ("merry bitterness") rather than fully embodying them through action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in its central concept and methodology. However, certain phrases feel unnecessarily ornate ("the low thrum of the hive-mind network," "ephemeral trauma," "resonant hum of potential") without adding substantive meaning. The emotional landscape relies more on stated feelings than demonstrated ones. The concept of "hive-mind" remains somewhat underdeveloped - we understand its importance but not its mechanics or full implications, suggesting a focus on creating mood over logical worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a distinct atmosphere and premise. The world of psychic residue and hive-mind therapy is intriguing and original. However, it occasionally prioritizes poetic language over clarity, and some concepts remain underdeveloped. The ending delivers a sense of resolution while maintaining appropriate mystery. The brevity works well for creating an atmospheric snapshot of this unusual profession, though it limits deeper exploration of the world's mechanics.</comment>
