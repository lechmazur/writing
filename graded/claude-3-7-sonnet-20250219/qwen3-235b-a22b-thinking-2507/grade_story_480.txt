<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The social media exorcist concept presents an intriguing motivation—seeking authenticity beyond curated reality—but Leo remains somewhat underdeveloped. His motivation is clear and consistent, but his reactions lack emotional depth. We understand what drives him intellectually but don't fully feel his transformation. His "indifferent enthusiasm" creates an interesting contradiction that's mentioned but not fully explored through his actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively connects the abandoned music hall to the secret gathering space, with receipts serving as both physical objects and metaphorical breadcrumbs. The narrative maintains coherence within its constraints, moving from infiltration to observation to realization. However, the central action of "reigniting" genuine connection feels more stated than demonstrated—we're told Leo's mission but don't fully witness its completion beyond his internal recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaces create a tangible atmosphere of decay and rebirth, with excellent sensory details like "plaster dust," "flickering bulbs," and "dusty air." The juxtaposition of digital ghosts with physical presence is effectively rendered. The receipts as artifacts connecting digital and physical worlds is particularly inventive. The "quietly loud" atmosphere is palpable throughout, creating a consistent mood that enhances the thematic exploration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively contrasts digital connection with physical presence, using metaphors of exorcism not as erasure but redirection. The subtext about technological alienation is well-developed. The ending provides satisfying closure while suggesting continuation. However, the emotional impact remains somewhat intellectual rather than visceral—we understand the significance intellectually but don't fully feel the transformative moment. The "reignition" remains more conceptual than demonstrated through specific interactions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on somewhat predictable imagery of digital detox. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("threadbare whisper," "temporary tribe," "tiny anchors"). The story shows signs of formulaic writing in its sentence structures and reliance on stated rather than demonstrated emotion. The characters beyond Leo remain symbolic rather than fully realized. However, the receipt-as-breadcrumb motif shows genuine creative thinking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that explores digital alienation and authentic connection. The world-building is particularly strong, creating an evocative setting that enhances the thematic exploration. However, the character development remains somewhat surface-level, and the emotional impact is more intellectual than visceral. The concept is intriguing but doesn't quite achieve the depth of insight that would elevate it to exceptional literary quality.</comment>
