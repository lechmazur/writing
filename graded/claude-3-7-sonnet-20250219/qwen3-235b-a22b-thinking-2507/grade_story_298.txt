<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Li Wei's character is well-developed through his dual nature as "rationally impulsive," which consistently drives his actions throughout. His motivation to "weave emotional honesty into illusions" for survivors shapes his investigation and creates a compelling purpose. The connection to the doll's dress reveals his methodical yet intuitive approach to uncovering truth. His theatrical background cleverly intersects with his detective work, though his personal emotional stakes could be further developed beyond his artistic mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery of the dress to uncovering the truth about Princess Ling, with solving the cold case effectively driving the narrative forward. The causal connections are logical and the resolution satisfying within the constraints. The story achieves surprising completeness in limited space, though the transition from investigation to preparation for performance feels slightly rushed. The integration of post-oil apocalypse with historical mystery creates a unique temporal tension that enriches the plot structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reimagined Chinese palace is vividly rendered through specific, evocative detailsâ€”"shattered jade roof," "cracked marble floors," "collapsed corridors," and "overgrown moon garden." The post-oil apocalyptic timeframe meaningfully connects to both setting and character motivation. The atmosphere of decay contrasted with persistent beauty perfectly embodies the "anxious serenity" tone. Sensory details like "dust motes dancing" and sunlight gilding the ruins create a haunting, immersive environment that enhances the story's emotional impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves considerable depth through its layered themes of art preserving forgotten truths, the intersection of performance and authenticity, and humanity's persistence after societal collapse. The central conflict between historical deception and artistic truth is elegantly resolved. The imagery of light piercing ruins works as both literal description and metaphor for truth emerging from darkness. The ending creates lingering emotional resonance through its bittersweet acknowledgment of art's power to connect people to painful realities rather than merely providing escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its post-apocalyptic theater concept and the integration of detective work with performance art. Language is generally fresh with specific details anchoring the imagery. However, some phrasing occasionally verges on purple prose ("anxious serenity of the late afternoon light"), and there's a tendency toward overly formal construction in places. The emotional trajectory feels authentic rather than algorithmic, avoiding stated emotions in favor of revealing character through action. The story maintains consistent tone throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements, weaving them together into a narrative that feels organic rather than contrived. The post-oil collapse world, theatrical preservation of history, and murder mystery elements combine to create something genuinely innovative. The brevity serves the story well, creating a concentrated, atmospheric piece with substantial thematic depth. The lingering image of the actor illuminated in ruins while preparing to speak for the forgotten dead offers powerful resonance beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
