<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias has clear motivations and depth, with his guilt about the railway accident and his wife's death creating compelling internal conflict. His journey from denial to confession feels authentic. However, his characterization could be strengthened through more specific personal details that differentiate him beyond his grief and guilt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively ties together the short-circuit, the confession, and the catharsis, creating a satisfying emotional arc. The causal relationships between Elias's past mistakes, his current grief, and his path to absolution are well-established. The story achieves remarkable coherence and completeness within its constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates a unique, evocative setting that perfectly complements the themes of communication, connection, and signal. Sensory details like the "scent of ozone," "bruised twilight sky," and "humid air" create a richly atmospheric world that mirrors Elias's emotional state. The abandoned railways and water tower extend the metaphor of connections lost and found.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its metaphorical landscape where radio waves, echoes, and railway lines all represent connection and truth. The ending provides genuine catharsis as Elias finds peace through confession. The narrative skillfully shows rather than tells his emotional journey, with physical actions (climbing the tower, timing the echo) externally manifesting his internal transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its unusual setting and the metaphorical resonance between radio waves, railways, and human connection. The prose occasionally risks becoming overly ornate but generally maintains emotional authenticity. The integration of technical details (timing echoes, radio equipment) with emotional content feels fresh rather than formulaic. Some descriptions like "grief surged not as a wave but as a precise, resonant frequency" show particular inventiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole with genuine emotional depth. The central metaphor of signals, tracks, and connections works at multiple levels. The brevity feels like a strength rather than a limitation, with each sentence carrying narrative and emotional weight. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about forgiveness, truth, and moving forward after devastating mistakes.</comment>
