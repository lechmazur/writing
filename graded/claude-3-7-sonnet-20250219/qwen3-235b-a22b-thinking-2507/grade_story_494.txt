<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman is exceptionally well-developed through showing rather than telling. His character transformation from contemptuous warrior to humbled student unfolds naturally through physical details (kicking plum blossoms, hidden manacles) and behavioral shifts. His internal conflict between pride and vulnerability creates authentic tension. The "doubtfully confident" attribute manifests consistently in his contradictory behaviors. His reaction to singing the wedding song reveals profound psychological depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves remarkable coherence despite its brevity. The journey from arrogance to humility forms a complete emotional arc with clear causality. The wedding song as method of authorization is masterfully integrated, creating the pivotal transformation moment. The physical breaking of manacles perfectly symbolizes the internal shift. The story achieves resolution without feeling rushed, though the transition from resistance to singing could have slightly more development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard provides a perfect symbolic counterpoint to the swordsman's aggressive energy. Sensory details (plum blossoms, stone veranda, inkstone, lotus leaf dew) create a meditative atmosphere that amplifies the theme of transformation. The contrast between hard elements (stone, iron) and soft ones (blossoms, ink) reinforces the "harsh tenderness" tone. The timeframe "between breaths" is ingeniously woven throughout as moments of suspended decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through layered symbolism (manacles as self-limitation, spark as hope) and the central metaphor of calligraphy as life-authoring. The subtext exploring how traditions can both bind and liberate gives the narrative philosophical weight. The ending achieves emotional resonance through the physical image of the swordsman walking into darkness carrying internal light. Dialogue is sparse but impactful, each line revealing character and advancing theme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story displays strong originality in its central metaphor and character transformation. The imagery avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors like manacles "clattering onto the stones like dead insects." However, occasional phrases like "the weight of his potential" and "reignite the dark" feel slightly formulaic. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than algorithmic, though the resolution comes with slightly too-neat symbolism that borders on predictable Eastern wisdom tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This story demonstrates exceptional integration of assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each component serves the central theme of self-liberation. The brevity feels purposeful rather than limiting, allowing the symbolic moments to resonate. The juxtaposition of warrior and artist creates productive tension throughout. The story achieves depth through its exploration of how we imprison ourselves through shame, and how tradition can be both burden and salvation—leaving the reader with meaningful philosophical questions about self-authorization.</comment>
