<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cyber-templar Kael is developed through clear tension between his technological past and current spiritual quest. His "patiently frantic" attribute manifests effectively in his trembling yet determined actions with the prism. However, his backstory remains somewhat sketchy, and the character's internal transformation, while present, relies too heavily on direct statements rather than fully earned emotional development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure follows a coherent arc from Kael's initial positioning at the burial site through his revelation and final acceptance. The action of "proving" drives the narrative well, with the prism method logically integrated. However, the story occasionally rushes through key moments that deserve deeper exploration, and some cause-effect relationships (particularly how the refraction specifically proves the mirage's falsity) remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sky burial setting is exceptionally well-utilized, creating a powerful liminal space between earth and sky that reinforces the thematic tension between illusion and reality. The storm provides visceral atmosphere through strong sensory details of rain, lightning, and wind. The integration of the burial site with the character's spiritual journey creates a richly symbolic landscape that elevates the narrative beyond mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the prism as both literal tool and metaphor for fragmenting perception, creating multiple layers of meaning. The theme of illusion versus reality is well-developed through consistent imagery. However, the impact is somewhat diminished by occasional overwriting and explicitly stating emotional states rather than fully demonstrating them through action. The ending achieves resonance but could benefit from more subtlety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the cyber-templar concept offers originality, the execution sometimes relies on overwrought phrases ("euphoric agitation," "exhilarating clarity") that feel artificial. The prose occasionally becomes purple, particularly in emotional crescendos. There's a tendency toward excessive adjectives and abstract statements about the character's enlightenment rather than concrete, specific details that would make the epiphany more authentic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole with a clear thematic through-line about illusion versus reality. The prism device works particularly well as both plot device and metaphor. However, occasional overwrought language and explicitly stated emotions diminish what could be a more subtle and powerful narrative. The story shows ambition and imagination but would benefit from more restraint in its execution.</comment>
