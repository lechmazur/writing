<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The apprentice's "uniquely literal" trait consistently shapes her approach to the star maps and her dismissal of warnings. Her motivation to find water sources is clear and drives her actions. However, her emotional depth remains somewhat limited - we understand what she does more than who she is, though her methodical determination does create a distinct persona.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "overcharge" action effectively drives the plot toward its climax with the plinth revelation. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints - from the initial decoding work to the successful revelation of coordinates and the protagonist's forward-looking conclusion. The cause-effect relationships are logical and the pacing effectively builds tension through to the revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement creates a richly atmospheric setting that perfectly complements the post-water-war timeframe. Sensory details like "damp stones humming," "cold breath," and "salt-stung dawn" create vivid immersion. The ghostly presences and their mysterious notes add supernatural tension that contrasts beautifully with the protagonist's methodical scientific approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story skillfully interweaves science and supernatural elements to create thematic depth about resourcefulness and determination in crisis. The ending achieves both narrative closure and forward momentum. Particularly effective is the symbolism of light (lighthouse, starlight) against darkness (basement, drought) that reinforces the hope-from-despair theme. The story shows rather than tells the protagonist's methodical nature through her actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of post-apocalyptic and supernatural elements with scientific methodology. The prose avoids generic descriptions, offering specific imagery like "starlight fracturing across the walls like liquid mercury." The protagonist's literal-mindedness feels authentic rather than mechanically logical. However, occasional phrases like "her brazen calm" are repeated, and some metaphors ("burning bright behind her eyes") verge on familiar territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The post-apocalyptic water scarcity setting provides meaningful context for the character's actions rather than feeling like a mere backdrop. The contrast between supernatural elements and scientific methodology creates compelling tension. The story leaves readers with both resolution (coordinates found) and meaningful continuation (the rebuilding to come).</comment>
