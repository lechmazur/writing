<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and compelling - finding waterfalls as symbolic absolution. The irate smuggler's guilt about his crew creates meaningful tension, and the chopstick functions effectively as an emotional anchor. However, the character lacks sufficient complexity in his emotional range, and his "revolt" feels somewhat abstractly rendered rather than viscerally experienced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from the jogging ritual to the tea leaf reading to the decision to search for the waterfalls. While the narrative achieves a complete arc within the constraints, the transition from running in circles to decisive action feels slightly rushed. The causal connections are clear, but the plot relies heavily on symbolism rather than concrete obstacles and actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is richly evoked with specific details like "cracked permacrete" and "rusted gantries" that create a powerful atmosphere of desolation. The contrast between the sterile, decaying environment and the organic ritual of tea leaves creates effective tension. The setting and the character's quest for waterfalls work together symbolically to represent renewal amid ruin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tea leaves as both plot device and metaphor, creating layers of meaning around guilt, hope and redemption. The waterfalls symbolism is particularly powerful. However, the writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states, and some metaphors ("heart's revolt") become repetitive. The ending creates meaningful tension but could deliver more emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, certain phrases feel unnecessarily ornate ("abstractly physical pressure behind his ribs"). The repetition of key phrases ("heart's revolt," "abstractly physical") creates a mechanical quality. Some descriptions rely on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific reactions. However, the tea leaf ritual and waterfall symbolism show originality in concept execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The emotional core - seeking redemption through finding what his crew died believing in - resonates meaningfully. The prose quality is uneven, occasionally overwritten but often evocative. The ending creates sufficient narrative tension to leave a lingering impression, though it could deliver more emotional impact.</comment>
