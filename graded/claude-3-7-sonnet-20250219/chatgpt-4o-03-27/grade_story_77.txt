<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as an introverted empath is effectively woven throughout the narrative, influencing her actions and motivations. Her empathic abilities are shown through her sensing others' emotions ("she felt their emotions swirl—boredom, suspicion, longing—and she drank them in like fuel") rather than merely told. Her connection to her brother through objects demonstrates depth, though her personal voice could be more distinct beyond her relationship to him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the reassembling of the marionette as both literal action and metaphor for Mira's emotional journey. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, moving from isolation to connection as Mira performs for the pirates. However, the transition from private grief to public performance feels slightly rushed, and the stakes of her "revolution" remain somewhat abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The space pirate hideout on an asteroid is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("dim lanterns flickered like tired stars," "recycled air"). The setting perfectly complements the themes of isolation, forgotten wisdom, and outcasts. The contrast between the cold void of space and the warmth of human connection creates a powerful atmosphere that enhances the emotional resonance of Mira's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the marionette as both literal object and metaphor for reconnection and giving voice to the silenced. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the final scene where the pirates fall silent, "their hearts cracked open by the dance." The theme of championing dismissed wisdom resonates throughout. However, the nature of the "revolution" and "truth" remains somewhat abstract, limiting the story's full potential impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, certain elements feel slightly formulaic. The metaphor of Mira becoming "the mountain herself" is somewhat heavy-handed. Some descriptions like "drowsy enthusiasm" and "brittle hope" feel like stock phrases. The story shows originality in its space setting and concept, but occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific, unique details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with emotional resonance. The space pirate setting, marionette, and empathic character work together naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity serves the story's dreamlike quality, though it limits full exploration of the revolution being sparked. The final image of the silent pirates watching the marionette's dance leaves a lingering impression, suggesting depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
