<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's "fierce apathy" is well-established and psychologically consistent. The tired swordsman's internal conflict between resignation and defiance feels authentic, with his motivation (the promise to himself) driving the narrative. His transformation is subtle yet powerful. However, without dialogue or deeper backstory, we miss some nuance that would elevate him from archetype to fully realized character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from resignation to renewal, with the action of "overcoming" driving the narrative forward. The meteor showers provide both literal and metaphorical guidance. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the beginning (breakroom resignation) connecting meaningfully to the end (walking toward possibility). The pacing effectively balances introspection with movement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery creates a striking visual backdrop that perfectly complements the themes of elevation and transcendence. The contrast between the stifling breakroom and the vast, open sky creates meaningful tension. Sensory details are precise and evocative—the chipped teacup, the wind biting his face, the meteors blazing "like divine arrows"—immersing readers in both physical setting and emotional atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism (the mirror, meteors as "sparks of rebellion") to deepen its impact. The central conflict between apathy and defiance resonates emotionally, while the theme of reclaiming one's authentic self emerges organically. The ending achieves poignancy through understatement: "Not a hero, not a martyr—just a man who kept a promise." The writing consistently shows rather than tells, though occasionally veers toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, with fresh imagery and consistent tone. However, certain phrases ("the gravity of what it contained," "eyes full of fire") border on cliché. The narrative occasionally relies on abstract statements rather than concrete details. While the premise of a disillusioned warrior finding renewal isn't entirely original, the execution through the meteor-following and mirror symbolism offers a fresh perspective on familiar themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence advancing character, plot, or atmosphere. The mirror as physical manifestation of the promise shows creative thinking. The story lingers after reading, raising questions about personal integrity and renewal. Minor weaknesses in originality and occasional abstraction prevent a higher score.</comment>
