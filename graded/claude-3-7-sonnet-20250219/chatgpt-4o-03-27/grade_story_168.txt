<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character of Marla as a ruthless flower arranger is well-developed and consistent. Her precision with flowers transfers effectively to her methodical approach to the mystery. The connection between her professional traits and her investigation creates a coherent character. However, her emotional journey could be more nuanced, and the transition from dismissive sister to determined investigator feels slightly rushed within the constraints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from Marla's initial curiosity to her acceptance of the watcher's burden. The stone circle mystery and her brother's disappearance provide compelling tension. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient with the comb pointing to the crucial stone, and the road trip conversations element feels underdeveloped rather than integral to the plot's progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stone circle setting is vividly rendered with strong atmospheric elements that enhance the mystery. The juxtaposition of ancient stones against Marla's modern sensibility creates effective tension. The timeframe element ("pause between verses") bookends the story elegantly, though it could be more consistently woven throughout the narrative rather than primarily at beginning and end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the comb, the eye glyph) and creates a compelling thematic exploration of observation versus action. The metaphor of arranging flowers extending to arranging clues works well. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by exposition in places where showing would be more powerful, and the resolution feels slightly too neat for the mystery established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, there are moments of overly formal phrasing ("polite anarchy stirred in her chest") and some metaphors feel somewhat generic ("her mind leaping from theory to theory like a fox through brambles"). The flower arrangement metaphors are fresh, but other elements like the "eternal watcher" concept rely on familiar tropes without sufficient subversion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear thematic through-line. The connection between Marla's profession and her approach to the mystery is particularly well-handled. However, some elements feel less organically incorporated (particularly the road trip conversations), and the resolution comes too easily given the mystery's apparent complexity.</comment>
