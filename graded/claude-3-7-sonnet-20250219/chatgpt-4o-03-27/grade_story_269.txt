<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's character as a nostalgic tailor is well-established and consistent. His tailoring background meaningfully connects to the metaphor of "stitching" lives together. His motivation to ascend is clear, though his initial resistance could be more deeply explored. The character shows growth from reluctance to acceptance, but his emotional journey feels somewhat compressed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the mirror's revelations to drive the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc from discovery to decision within the tight constraints. The connection between breaking the code and discovering the Ascendants creates logical cause-and-effect. The progression from denial to acceptance to resolve forms a coherent journey, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck creates an immediate and distinctive atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of perspective and transcendence. The storm serves as both literal setting and metaphorical representation of Elias's internal turmoil. Sensory details like "brass gears," "copper bones," and lightning "illuminating the sky like fractured glass" create vivid immersion. The setting and mirror work in perfect harmony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the tailoring metaphor throughout, creating a consistent thematic thread about "stitching" lives together. The mirror as a portal to self-knowledge offers meaningful symbolism. The ending provides satisfying resolution while maintaining mystery. The central conflict between accepting or rejecting one's multiple selves is well-executed. The story successfully "shows" Elias's emotional journey through his physical reactions and dialogue with the mirror.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some metaphors feel slightly generic ("heart pounding"). The parallel lives concept, while well-executed, follows somewhat predictable patterns of revelation and acceptance. The writing occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. However, the tailoring metaphor is consistently and freshly applied throughout, demonstrating creative integration of the character's profession with the story's themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole. The steampunk setting, mirror, and tailoring profession work together naturally rather than feeling forced. The brevity serves the story well, creating a focused character journey. The metaphor of stitching lives together provides thematic resonance that lingers beyond the final line. While some emotional transitions feel compressed, the overall execution demonstrates skilled craftsmanship within the constraints.</comment>
