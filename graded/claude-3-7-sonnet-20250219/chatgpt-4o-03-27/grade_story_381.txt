<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The necromancer is well-developed through his unconventional approach to his craft—communion rather than domination—and his backstory as a former geologist adds depth. His motivation to complete maps through communing with the dead is clear and consistent. The emotional connection to his brother through old movies creates a poignant dimension to his character. However, we could benefit from more insight into his internal conflicts or how his transformation from scientist to necromancer changed him psychologically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from the necromancer's descent into the cave to the completion of the map, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The shared love of old movies drives the plot forward in an unexpected way, serving both as method of communion and emotional core. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with the final map creation serving as an effective resolution. The pacing effectively balances exposition, action, and emotional beats without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details—phosphorescent light, harmonic vibrations, and crystal walls that reflect film scenes. The post-apocalyptic timeframe where "science has turned into myth" creates a compelling backdrop. The atmosphere perfectly balances eerie supernatural elements with warm nostalgia, creating a unique tone that enhances both the necromancer's actions and the emotional core of the story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of mapping to explore themes of memory, connection beyond death, and the power of shared cultural touchstones. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the brother's appearance and the final map creation. The writing shows restraint and precision, with evocative imagery that serves the narrative rather than overwhelming it. The ending feels both conclusive and resonant, suggesting deeper meaning beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of necromancy with cartography and cinema, creating a fresh concept. The prose avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and natural emotional progression. Descriptions like "scenes from forgotten movies flickered across the crystal walls like projections from a broken reel" feel specific rather than generic. However, some phrases like "impossible geometry" and "ancient cartographic runes" lean toward familiar fantasy tropes without sufficient subversion or specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The necromancer's use of film dialogue to commune with the dead is particularly inventive. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused narrative with emotional resonance. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about this world and the relationship between memory, death, and creation that extend beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
