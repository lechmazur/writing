<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's aloofness is well-integrated into his character as a cartographer who observes rather than participates. His motivation to "learn the language of the soul" drives the narrative coherently, showing growth from his earlier inability to map feelings. The contrast between his analytical nature and Kaia's emotional fluency creates meaningful tension. His dialogue is sparse but distinctive, revealing his character through what he chooses to say.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the action of "expand" both literally (mapping) and metaphorically (emotional growth). The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraintsâ€”beginning with Elian's return to a significant location, revealing the past relationship through flashback, and concluding with reconciliation and new possibilities. The cracked tile serves as an elegant plot device connecting past and present. The pacing balances exposition and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is vividly rendered with specific details (holographic mannequins, drone-operated kiosks) that create a compelling contrast with the organic, emotional elements of the story. The cracked tile functions brilliantly as both literal and metaphorical anchor in this sterile environment. The juxtaposition of technological perfection against human imperfection enhances the theme. The neon-lit canals beneath the city create a dreamlike secondary setting that expands the world effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in the cracked tile representing broken connections and enduring memory. The contrast between mapping physical spaces and emotional landscapes creates meaningful subtext. The ending offers satisfying resolution while maintaining openness about the future. The story effectively "shows" Elian's emotional growth through his actions rather than telling. The theme of reconnection and emotional cartography is consistently developed throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, some metaphors ("a laugh that echoed like sunlight on water") feel somewhat generic. The phrase "eager in his resignation" creates an interesting tension but feels slightly forced. The story demonstrates originality in its concept of emotional cartography and the integration of futuristic elements with intimate human connection. The narrative maintains consistent tone and avoids purple prose while still creating vivid imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, creating a focused emotional moment with broader implications. The metaphor of mapping emotions provides depth beyond the explicit narrative. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about how Elian and Kaia will "expand the map together," suggesting meaningful continuation beyond the text itself.</comment>
