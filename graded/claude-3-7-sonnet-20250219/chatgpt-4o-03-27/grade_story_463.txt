<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rook's dry wit manifests subtly through his muttered comments and internal observations. His motivation to preserve tradition while acknowledging its evolution is consistent and well-developed. The character's relationship with the rope reveals his complex attitude toward sentiment in his otherwise unsentimental work. His voice remains distinct throughout, though we could benefit from slightly more insight into what personally drives his dedication beyond professional obligation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally from the crossing off of the final name to Rook's dance that reactivates the lighthouse, creating a satisfying arc. The confiscation of the rope serves as both plot device and symbol. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the dance method logically integrated into the narrative. The pacing expertly balances exposition and action, though the exact nature of the consequences for those who ignored tradition could be slightly clearer.</comment>

The atmosphere of decay, tradition, and supernatural presence permeates every element. The integration of the lighthouse's function with the ritual dance creates a world where the practical and mystical seamlessly coexist. Sensory details are precise and evocative, creating an immersive experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolismâ€”the rope, the list, the dance all represent the tension between tradition and progress. The ending delivers emotional impact through Rook's reclamation of tradition. Literary devices are employed with precision: "eroding promises carved into stone and salt" exemplifies the metaphorical richness. The theme of honoring the past without being trapped by it emerges organically. The story shows rather than tells, particularly in how Rook's dance demonstrates his character and beliefs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates consistent originality in its metaphors and descriptions. The lighthouse as guardian of tradition is a familiar trope, but it's handled with fresh perspective and nuance. The prose avoids purple territory while maintaining poetic qualities. Emotional resonance comes through specific details rather than stated feelings. The narrative voice maintains consistency throughout, with no jarring shifts in tone or style. The integration of the dance as both literal and metaphorical element shows particular ingenuity.</comment>
