<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian's fierce loyalty to the Order is well-established and drives his actions consistently. His "individually common" attribute is effectively integrated, explaining why he's chosen as an unassuming vessel for radical teachings. However, his internal conflict could be more deeply explored—we understand what he does but less about his personal stakes or emotional journey beyond loyalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the power outage as both framing device and catalyst, with clear cause-effect relationships. The narrative arc moves from observation to realization to commitment, creating a satisfying progression. However, the story's resolution feels somewhat abstract rather than concrete—we understand Elian's intention to spread teachings but don't see specific actions that demonstrate this change beyond his declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower during a citywide blackout creates a compelling atmosphere of isolation and perspective. The imagery of moths, darkness, and flickering lights works as both literal setting and metaphorical reinforcement of the "inner lantern" concept. Sensory details like "the scent of dust, ozone, and moth wings" and the warmth of the journal create immersive texture that enhances the mystical tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses metaphor throughout, particularly the extended motif of storms, moths, and light to represent inner turmoil and enlightenment. The subversion of meditation as "holding chaos" rather than seeking peace offers thought-provoking depth. The ending creates a sense of threshold-crossing that invites reflection. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the Order's practices and Elian's emotional state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of comedy as radical camouflage and meditation as chaos-containment. However, some metaphors feel somewhat generic ("like ancient spirits," "like blessings"), and the narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing Elian's emotional state. The writing maintains consistent tone but sometimes employs overly formal phrasing that creates distance rather than intimacy with the protagonist's experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole, particularly in how the moth imagery, storm metaphors, and comedy-as-camouflage concept reinforce each other. The brevity works well for creating an atmospheric moment of transformation rather than a plot-heavy narrative. While the story leaves readers with intriguing questions about the Order and its teachings, some elements (particularly the coded jokes) could be more specifically rendered to ground the abstract concepts.</comment>
