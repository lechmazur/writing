<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassian's character as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is well-established and his motivation to find closure regarding his father's disappearance drives his actions convincingly. His emotional journey from frozen to thawing is effectively portrayed through his interaction with his father's ghost. The character possesses psychological depth through his conflicted relationship with divingâ€”both his profession and the source of his trauma. However, some aspects of his personality beyond his grief remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively connects Cassian's diving profession, his ghost-whispering ability, and his personal quest for closure. The narrative moves logically from the discovery of the amber to the emotional resolution with his father's ghost. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, with the amber serving as both catalyst and symbol. The pacing manages the emotional buildup well, though the revelation of the father's ghost could have been more gradually developed for stronger impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creates a hauntingly effective atmosphere that mirrors Cassian's emotional state. Sensory details like "thick with dust and memory" and "the scent of rusted metal and old popcorn" vividly establish the setting. The juxtaposition of the carnival (representing past joy) with abandonment (representing loss) creates a resonant backdrop for the ghost encounter. The setting meaningfully connects to the family tradition mentioned, enhancing the emotional weight of the reunion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the amber with its trapped insect as a central metaphor for preservation and timelessness that parallels the ghost story. The emotional impact is strong, particularly in the father-son reunion scene. The theme of stepping out of shadows and finding closure is well-executed. However, some dialogue feels slightly on-the-nose ("I'm ready to step out of your shadow"), and certain metaphors, while evocative, occasionally border on being too explicit rather than allowing readers to make connections themselves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of a wreck-diver ghost whisperer and the amber as a conduit between worlds. The writing avoids most AI-typical patterns and maintains consistent tone. However, certain phrases like "joy and sorrow once danced hand in hand" and "fragile, luminous, and finally free" feel somewhat formulaic. The emotional progression is generally authentic, though the ghost's appearance and dialogue could benefit from more subtlety to avoid feeling too convenient for narrative closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The amber, ghost-whispering ability, and abandoned carnival setting work together particularly well. The brevity feels appropriate rather than limiting, allowing for a complete emotional arc. The story leaves readers with the lingering feeling of Cassian's emotional liberation and new beginning. While not flawless, it demonstrates creative thinking in how the elements interconnect to serve the central theme of emotional thawing and stepping out of shadows.</comment>
