<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The unseen observer is well-developed through his patient waiting, purposeful actions, and "aggressively kind" nature that manifests as fierce determination rather than gentleness. His motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear and consistent throughout. However, we lack deeper insight into his personal history or emotional complexity beyond his mission, which prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot forms a satisfying circular structure, beginning and ending with the dancer's foot touching the stage. The action of "flinging" appears multiple times (window, forgetting) and drives pivotal moments. The whale's call effectively connects all story elements, creating a cohesive narrative about reclaiming lost traditions. The cause-effect relationships are clear, though the exact nature of the traditions remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room creates a liminal space perfectly suited for bridging past and present. Sensory details are exceptional—the salt air "slicing like a blade," the whale's call resonating through bones, the whistle "humming with ancestral memory." The "brazen calm" permeates the atmosphere, creating tension between stillness and urgency. The setting, timeframe, and oceanic elements form a seamless, immersive world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—the lighthouse as guardian of memory, the whale as voice of the deep past, the dancer as vessel for tradition. The circular structure creates a sense of ritual renewal. The prose is lyrical without becoming purple. While the story effectively shows rather than tells, some readers might desire more concrete details about the specific traditions being rescued.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids AI-typical patterns through its consistent tone and unique metaphors. The transformation of the plastic whistle into "salt and memory" demonstrates creative subversion of expectations. The narrative maintains a distinctive voice throughout. However, some phrases like "the deep itself remembers" and "centuries of forgetting" verge on abstraction that could be more specifically rendered, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The brevity works as a strength, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the theme of memory and tradition. The circular structure provides satisfying closure while suggesting the cycle will continue. The lingering impression of ancient wisdom reclaimed gives the piece emotional resonance beyond its literal events.</comment>
