The pacing expertly balances scene-setting with forward momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace brilliantly fuses ancient architecture with futuristic technology, creating a distinctive cyberpunk-classical hybrid. Sensory details like steam from the teapot, scent of roasted olives, and the "low hum of encrypted trade" immerse readers completely. The juxtaposition of "holographic laurel wreaths" with traditional market elements creates a richly textured world that enhances the themes of preservation and erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story powerfully explores themes of historical erasure, resistance, and the reclamation of identity. The rake handle serves as an effective metaphor for analog preservation in a digital world. The final revelation of Livia's name delivers emotional impact through understatement. The writing shows rather than tells, particularly in moments like the genuine smile offered to the child—a small gesture that reveals character depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its fusion of ancient Roman and cyberpunk elements.

The world-building feels cohesive rather than algorithmically assembled.</comment>
