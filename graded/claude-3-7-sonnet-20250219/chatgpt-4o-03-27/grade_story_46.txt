<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer is effectively characterized through his actions rather than explicit description. His trembling fingers contrasting with his expressionless face creates compelling tension. His motivation to learn the language of dreams is consistent throughout, though his emotional journey could be more nuanced beyond the final revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from routine to revelation, with the moth-carried rumor serving as an effective turning point. The approval process through moon paths creates a consistent internal logic. The resolution feels earned when the performer begins to "dream in his own language," though the middle section could be tightened slightly for better pacing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with the fern orchard and waterfalls creating a liminal, dreamlike space. The sensory details—particularly the piano notes manifesting as "shifting symbols" and the waterfalls that "roared like forgotten gods"—establish a richly immersive setting that perfectly complements the surreal tone and dreamlike concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism and metaphors. The transformation of music into visible symbols, rumors into physical entities, and the performer's journey from guardian to participant creates a compelling thematic exploration of art, truth, and self-expression. The ending delivers emotional resonance without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its dreamlike logic and surreal imagery. The metaphors feel fresh rather than formulaic, particularly the moth with "wings like torn parchment." While occasionally verging on purple prose, the language generally serves the story's ethereal quality. The consistent tone maintains authenticity throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The surreal elements serve the central theme rather than feeling like arbitrary inclusions. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a dreamlike compression that mirrors its subject matter. The lingering questions about the nature of truth and art provide satisfying depth.</comment>
