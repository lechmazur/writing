<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira's character as a critical midwife is well-established and her skeptical nature consistently informs her actions. Her "openly secretive" attribute manifests naturally in how she "reveal[s] truths in riddles and hid[es] pain in plain sight." Her motivation to recover memories feels authentic, though her emotional journey could be more deeply rendered beyond the intellectual realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively builds from Eira's search to her revelation, with the transcendence action driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from memory loss to reclamation with logical progression. The connection between the half-burned diaries and her recovered memories creates a satisfying coherence, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard island setting is exceptionally rendered with vivid sensory detailsâ€”the "pale shimmer" of moonlight, the "scent of charred paper," and fruits "shaped like faces." The maelstrom creates perfect tension against the island's calm, embodying Eira's internal struggle. The atmosphere of "dissonant calm" permeates the narrative and enhances the otherworldly quality of memory recovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional and intellectual impact through its exploration of memory, trauma, and self-protection. Rich symbolism (the face-shaped fruit, the well of memories) and the central metaphor of midwifery as rebirth demonstrate sophisticated craft. The theme of transcendence through confronting buried truths rather than escaping them provides meaningful depth, though some metaphors could be more subtly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept and execution, particularly in the integration of midwifery with memory recovery. However, some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ("dissonant calm," "openly secretive") and certain transitions between images feel abrupt. The narrative maintains a consistent dreamlike tone but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works to create a dreamlike quality appropriate to memory exploration. While some transitions could be smoother and certain metaphors less explicit, the overall effect is of a thoughtful, layered narrative that leaves the reader with lingering questions about memory, trauma, and self-knowledge.</comment>
