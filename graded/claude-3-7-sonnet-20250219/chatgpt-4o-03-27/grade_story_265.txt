<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character of Deputy Mara Vell is effectively developed through her impassive exterior contrasted with her inner emotional life. Her "personally impersonal demeanor" creates tension between her official role and spiritual quest. Her motivation to witness grace is clear, though we could benefit from understanding why this matters so deeply to her specifically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Mara's entry to her departure, with the twist tie serving as both key and symbol. The story achieves a sense of completion within its constraints. However, the connection between oil changes and bee communication feels somewhat tenuous, and the resolution, while poetic, leaves some logical questions about the nature of the vision unanswered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of a lush orchard within cathedral rafters creates a striking, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details are exceptionalâ€”the scent of figs, humming bees, moss-covered beams, and shimmering air create an immersive, dreamlike quality. The setting perfectly enhances the mystical nature of Mara's quest and the story's exploration of sacred experiences outside traditional religious structures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story excels in its lyrical prose and evocative imagery. The central theme of finding grace in unexpected places is effectively conveyed through symbolism (bees as messengers, fruit as offerings). The narrative successfully "shows" Mara's emotional journey through her actions and observations rather than explicit statements. The ending resonates with a sense of completion while maintaining mystery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the prose is often beautiful, there are moments where it becomes overly ornate ("a curtain of breath," "pure, unfiltered grace"). The bee communication concept, while original, occasionally feels like a device rather than an organic element. Some metaphors feel slightly forced. However, the story avoids most AI-typical patterns and demonstrates a consistent tone and unique approach to its surreal elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that explores faith, nature, and personal revelation. The surreal elements serve the emotional and thematic core rather than feeling arbitrary. The brevity works in its favor, creating a dreamlike quality appropriate to the content. While occasionally veering into overwrought language, it leaves readers with lingering questions about grace, perception, and the sacred in unexpected places.</comment>
