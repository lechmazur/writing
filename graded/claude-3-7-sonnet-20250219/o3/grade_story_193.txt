<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exiled prince and archivist are well-developed despite the brevity. Their motivations (curing loneliness, reconciliation) are clear and consistent. Prince Talis's relationship with his past and Liora's connection to his "unintentionally iconic yet tragically unfinished" poems create layered characterization. Their shared history adds depth, though dialogue would have strengthened their distinct voices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from exile to chance encounter to resolution. The snowstorm effectively drives the narrative, creating both physical isolation and the opportunity for reconciliation. The alchemical ritual provides a satisfying climax, with the "tax" of emotional honesty paid to unseen forces. The arc feels complete without being rushed, moving from isolation to connection with clear cause-effect relationships.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric writing creates a liminal space where past and present blur. The customs office—where things are evaluated, taxed, or confiscated—perfectly mirrors the emotional journey. Sensory details (sleet rattling roof, ink smell, contraband perfumes, frost in hair) immerse readers in this threshold space. The snowstorm physically manifests the emotional isolation while creating the conditions for connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its extended metaphor of emotional debts as customs to be paid. Rich imagery (grinding loneliness into paste, moonlight distillate) elevates the narrative beyond its literal events. The ending delivers catharsis without sentimentality. The theme of reconciliation with one's past to move forward is elegantly conveyed through the customs office setting and the ritual of transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose shows distinctive style with fresh metaphors and evocative imagery. However, certain phrases ("a fever in his blood," "snowstorm thickened into white walls") feel slightly overwrought. The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls through consistent tone and emotional nuance, though occasionally the language becomes too ornate. The concept of a customs office for emotional baggage shows genuine originality despite working within recognizable fantasy tropes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The customs office setting brilliantly serves the theme of emotional tariffs and reconciliation. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying multiple layers of meaning. The lingering impression of two people stepping "from exile into a world neither would rule nor catalog" provides satisfying emotional closure while suggesting continued growth.</comment>
