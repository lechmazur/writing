<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dreamy poet's character is effectively established through their contemplative narration and poetic sensibility. Their formally rebellious nature manifests in their questioning of rules while still adhering to a personal code. The character's motivation to honor the unremembered is clear and consistent, though we could benefit from slightly more insight into why this particular mission matters so deeply to them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from the cryptic summons to the revelation at the station. The action of compelling through the wax seal drives the narrative forward with purpose. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with the opening mystery resolved through the emotional reunion with the forgotten passengers. The cause-effect relationships are logical within the established supernatural framework.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned railway station is rendered with exceptional sensory detail—moonlight through broken rafters, the taste of stories, the smell of coal and lilacs. The setting perfectly complements both the concept of undoing erasure and the character's poetic sensibilities. The atmosphere of quiet intensity permeates every description, creating a hauntingly beautiful world where the mundane and magical seamlessly intertwine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact through its lyrical prose and evocative imagery. Literary devices abound—the sundial's gnomon "quivering like a compass needle" and time that "condenses into a single shadow." The theme of remembrance and the power of bearing witness is effectively conveyed through showing rather than telling. The ending provides satisfying closure while maintaining an air of mystery that lingers with the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the prose is undeniably beautiful, it occasionally veers into territory that feels slightly overwrought ("the doctrine of rebellion my tutors had stitched into my cuffs"). Some metaphors, while striking, call attention to themselves rather than serving the narrative. However, the story maintains a consistent voice and tone throughout, and the emotional resonance feels genuine rather than manufactured. The handling of the supernatural elements shows originality in execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all required elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The poetic style enhances rather than obscures meaning, creating a dreamlike atmosphere appropriate to the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, giving the piece the quality of a vivid glimpse into a larger world. The story leaves the reader with lingering questions about memory, obligation, and the power of acknowledgment.</comment>
