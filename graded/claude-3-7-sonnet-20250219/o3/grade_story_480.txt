<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The social media exorcist is well-developed through a distinctive first-person voice that reveals their professional cynicism alongside genuine curiosity. Their motivation—feeding on "life's raw edge" while performing for followers—creates compelling tension. The character's indifferent enthusiasm manifests consistently in both actions and narrative tone. However, we could benefit from slightly more insight into what drives this specific exorcism beyond algorithmic demands.</comment>

The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the ritual structure providing excellent pacing. The transition from solo performance to spectral interaction to conclusion feels organic rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through sensory-rich descriptions that blend digital and supernatural realms. The abandoned mess hall and music hall create a perfect backdrop for the haunting, with details like "molds and cobwebs draped like unpopular curtains" and "dust motes floated as if shouting" establishing vivid sensory immersion. The juxtaposition of modern technology against decay creates tension that enhances the concept of familiar strangers existing between worlds.</comment>
