<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obituary-writer protagonist is exceptionally well-developed through their unique profession and rebellious nature. Their motivation to restore theater through the mask creates a compelling character arc. The first-person narration establishes a distinctive voice that balances poetic insight with pragmatic determination. The character's method of writing provisional obituaries to navigate choices is particularly inventive, revealing their professional mindset while advancing the plot. Minor weakness: some emotional reactions could be more viscerally rendered rather than intellectually described.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the labyrinth concept to create rising action as the protagonist climbs the bookshelf. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with clear cause-and-effect relationships between the protagonist's actions and consequences. The narrative arc from discovery to acquisition to purposeful descent creates satisfying closure. The pacing accelerates appropriately toward the climax when the mask is obtained. The only weakness is that some transitions between major plot points (particularly the giant's reaction) feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is masterfully rendered with vivid sensory details that create both scale and intimacy. The physical verticality of the shelves perfectly complements the labyrinth concept and the protagonist's journey. The revolutionary timeframe creates palpable tension that permeates the atmosphere. Exceptional sensory imagery—from the "flickering candle" to the "cool as snow and hot as applause" mask—creates immersive physicality. The organ chamber within a dictionary is a particularly inspired fusion of setting elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through its layered metaphors and thematic depth. The narrative effectively "shows" the protagonist's determination through action rather than exposition. The central conflict between art and revolution is elegantly established and resolved through the transformative power of performance. The ending achieves poignancy through its unfinished obituary metaphor. The story's exploration of art as a revolutionary act itself creates meaningful subtext. Dialogue is minimal but impactful. The prose style balances lyricism with narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong originality in its conceptual framework and execution. The metaphors are fresh and specific to the narrative context rather than generic. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than stated. The writing maintains consistent tone while avoiding purple prose. The narrative demonstrates genuine ingenuity in combining elements like the obituary-writing method of navigation and the mask's changing expressions. Minor weaknesses include occasional moments of overly ornate language that slightly disrupt the otherwise strong flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. These elements feel integral rather than forced, each serving the central narrative and thematic purpose. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying significant narrative weight. The story demonstrates exceptional creative thinking in how it interweaves the protagonist's profession with their method of navigation. The final image of the "obituary I never had to finish" provides a lingering emotional resonance that transcends the explicit narrative.</comment>
