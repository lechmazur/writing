<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's dry wit manifests beautifully through their sardonic observations and detached yet dutiful stance. Their motivation—guarding "eroding promises" after the keeper's disappearance—feels authentic and consistent. Mara serves as an effective foil with her academic approach to folklore, creating tension between preservation-as-data versus preservation-as-ritual. Both characters possess distinct voices that reveal their worldviews through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows with remarkable coherence despite its supernatural elements. The confiscation of Mara's possessions creates escalating tension while symbolically lightening her for transformation. The Fathom Waltz serves as both literal action and metaphorical bridge between worlds. The story achieves a complete arc—from the narrator's burden to Mara's anointment and the narrator's release—with cause-effect relationships that feel inevitable rather than contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is rendered with exquisite sensory detail—moonlight "slicing dust with surgical beams," "maps of phosphorescent mold," and "briny violins" create a liminal space between worlds. The atmosphere balances decay and renewal, perfectly complementing the theme of preservation through transformation. The lighthouse itself becomes a character, with its lens serving as both practical tool and supernatural arbiter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable depth through its layered symbolism—the dance as ritual, the rope as both connection and history, the crossed-out names as legacy. The central conflict between preservation and renewal resolves beautifully with the insight that "preserved history must acknowledge scars rather than disguise them." The writing demonstrates masterful control of rhythm, with sentences that mirror the waltz's cadence and the lighthouse's sweeping beam.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story avoids common supernatural tropes through its focus on ritual and responsibility rather than fear. Metaphors feel fresh and specific to the maritime setting—"moved like a buoy courting horizons" and "light that repaired the rope." The emotional progression feels authentically human rather than algorithmic, particularly in the narrator's relief at finding a worthy successor. The only slight weakness is occasional overreliance on adjective-noun constructions that slightly diminish the otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This story demonstrates exceptional integration of assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends its constraints. The lighthouse setting, frayed rope, and ritual dance work in concert to explore themes of preservation, legacy, and renewal. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence carrying multiple layers of meaning. The ending achieves both narrative closure and thematic resonance, leaving the reader with a haunting image of continuity amid change.</comment>
