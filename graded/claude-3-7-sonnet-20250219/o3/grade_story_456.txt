<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orrin's character is well-developed through his morbid florist identity, which shapes his worldview ("negotiating with decay") and actions. His neutrally passionate demeanor creates an intriguing contradiction that drives his approach to both flowers and cosmic understanding. However, his emotional journey lacks some nuance—his shift from somber expertise to cosmic acceptance feels slightly underdeveloped within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the dojo's orbital instability with Orrin's task of reading ancient maintenance manuals. The action of obliging Master Zhen's request drives the narrative forward with clear purpose. The story achieves a satisfying arc from problem (drifting dojo) to resolution (stabilized orbit) through Orrin's ritual. The cause-effect relationship between the burning page, smoke calligraphy, and the dojo's stabilization creates a coherent magical system.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo in a violet stratosphere creates an immediately immersive, otherworldly setting. Sensory details are exceptional—the chalk-scented candle, midnight orchids smelling of turned earth, smoke forming calligraphy "only sorrow could read." The timeframe of a guttering lantern perfectly frames the story's meditation on cycles of light and darkness, creating tension through impending darkness that enhances the ritual's significance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable thematic depth, exploring cycles of decay and renewal through rich symbolism. The central metaphor connecting celestial orbits with emotional acceptance creates profound resonance. Literary devices are masterfully employed—petals as "funerary confetti," darkness that perches "attentive, respectful," and wax pooling "like clarified grief." The ending offers genuine philosophical insight about renewal rather than mere resolution, though some metaphors occasionally border on overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its cosmic-floral metaphors and the unique setting. However, certain phrases ("neutrally passionate," "boldly timid") feel deliberately paradoxical in a way that draws attention to themselves as writing exercises rather than organic descriptions. The prose occasionally becomes too dense with metaphor, particularly in the middle sections where multiple elaborate images stack upon each other, suggesting a writer overly concerned with demonstrating literary technique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the exercise. The floating dojo, morbid florist, and cosmic cycles merge into a meditation on impermanence that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works as a strength, creating a concentrated, poetic experience. While occasionally overwritten, the story achieves a delicate balance between concrete ritual and abstract meaning that lingers after reading.</comment>
