The structure effectively mirrors the "launch" metaphor throughout. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with the embroidered tablecloths and gathering crowd creating logical progression. The resolution feels earned rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned rocket launch site functions brilliantly as both literal setting and metaphor for failed aspirations and broken connections.

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its extended metaphor of rockets/launching as family relationships.
