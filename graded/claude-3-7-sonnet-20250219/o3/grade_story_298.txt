<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yuan-Li's character is well-developed through his chameleon-like abilities that extend beyond mere acting to physical transformation. His rationally impulsive nature drives his investigation coherently, and his motivation to restore emotional honesty to illusions creates a compelling internal conflict. The character's relationship with the tattered dress and mirror shows depth as they trigger both his abilities and his connection to history. However, his emotional journey could be more nuanced rather than primarily expressed through his changing skin pigments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively weaves Yuan-Li's investigation with the historical mystery, creating a satisfying arc from discovery to decision. The cold-case solving method drives the narrative forward naturally, with each revelation building logically to the next. The connection between the beginning (entering the palace) and end (performing with newfound knowledge) creates excellent closure while opening new possibilities. The pacing manages to deliver a complete story with rising tension and resolution despite the word constraints, though the political implications of the truth could be more fully integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The post-oil world with its recycled freighter palace creates a distinctive atmosphere that brilliantly merges past and future. The failing solar lamps and sunlight through debris establish both literal illumination and metaphorical revelation. Sensory details like "rat skeletons glinted like ivory actors" and "jade floor" create vivid imagery that enhances the theatrical theme. The setting's connection to the character's abilities and the story's central mystery is seamless, with the palace itself becoming almost a character that responds to Yuan-Li's discoveries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional and intellectual impact through its layered exploration of truth, performance, and historical reconciliation. The central metaphor of theatrical illusion as both concealment and revelation of truth is masterfully developed. Literary devices like "history coil inside him like a spring" effectively convey subtext. The ending creates satisfying closure while maintaining mystery. The theme of using art to reveal difficult truths gradually rather than dangerously all at once demonstrates sophisticated storytelling craft. However, some metaphors occasionally border on overwritten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality in its post-petrochemical Chinese setting and the concept of a physically transformative actor. The integration of theatrical metaphors with historical investigation feels fresh. However, some phrasing becomes unnecessarily ornate ("pigments on his skin shifted into the hue of antique brocade"), and emotional states are occasionally told rather than shown. The prose sometimes strains for literary effect with phrases like "sealed by lacquer and sorrow" that feel slightly artificial. Despite these issues, the core concept and execution remain inventive and engaging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its numerous assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The post-oil Chinese setting, chameleon actor, and historical mystery work together to create a unique narrative with thematic depth about truth, art, and responsibility. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining, with each sentence advancing multiple elements simultaneously. The lingering questions about Yuan-Li's heritage and the consequences of his performance create depth beyond the explicit narrative. Minor weaknesses in prose style and occasional telling rather than showing prevent a higher score.</comment>
