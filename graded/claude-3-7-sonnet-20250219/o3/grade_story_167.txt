<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is well-developed as a dutiful scholar with subversive intentions, showing clear motivation to preserve erased history. Their actions consistently reflect their established traits—methodical, risk-taking, principled. The first-person narration provides a distinct voice that balances academic precision with poetic reflection. However, some emotional depth is sacrificed for conceptual exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The contamination action drives the plot with exceptional coherence. The narrative flows logically from preparation to execution to confrontation, with the makeshift well method cleverly integrated. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, with the beginning (preparation) connecting seamlessly to the ending (potential revolution). The pacing expertly balances exposition and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting is masterfully rendered with specific sensory details—humming corridors, neon stacks, magnetic boots on ladder rungs. The timeframe of pre-test calm creates perfect tension. The futuristic environment and the improvised well brilliantly contrast technological advancement with ancient methods. The atmosphere of oppressive order being disrupted by forbidden knowledge permeates every description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves profound impact through its exploration of historical erasure and resistance. Literary devices—particularly the metaphor of "contamination" as truth-telling—are sophisticated and consistent. The ending offers both resolution and opening possibilities, leaving readers with lingering questions about courage versus compliance. The central conflict between institutional control and historical truth is elegantly established and developed through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its concept and execution, particularly in the creative adaptation of the well echo. However, some phrasing occasionally veers toward overly poetic construction ("Binary dust spilled upward"), and certain metaphors feel slightly manufactured rather than organic. The emotional progression of the guards feels somewhat accelerated given the high stakes. Nevertheless, the narrative maintains consistent tone and avoids most AI-typical patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element serves the narrative rather than feeling forced. The prose style balances complexity and clarity effectively, with occasional moments of unnecessary density. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, with each sentence advancing multiple aspects of plot, character, and theme. The lingering question about whether courage will triumph over compliance provides satisfying depth.</comment>
