<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas's character is well-developed through his professional cuddler identity and the psychological barriers he maintains. His motivation to overcome inherited prejudice is clear and his transformation feels earned. However, Yara remains somewhat underdeveloped beyond her functional role, and their connection could benefit from more nuanced exploration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Silas's isolation through the chance encounter to his transformation, with the phantom punch serving as an effective catalyst. However, the shift from farmer's market to awards gala feels abrupt, and the structural decay subplot emerges too suddenly near the end, creating a slight disconnect in the narrative flow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The world-building blends mundane and fantastical elements masterfully, creating a distinctive atmosphere where professional cuddling, phantom artifacts, and spaceports coexist naturally. The sensory details of the market and the "amber glow" create vivid imagery, though the refugee observatory could be more thoroughly integrated into the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the professional cuddler premise as metaphor for emotional barriers, with strong thematic exploration of touch, healing, and prejudice. The prose is lyrical without becoming purple, and the ending delivers emotional resonance. However, the structural danger subplot feels somewhat tacked on rather than organically developed throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases like "neutron lotus" and "Station Kalpa" feel inserted without sufficient context. The narrative occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Silas's transformation. Some transitions between scenes feel mechanical rather than organic, though the core concept is handled with originality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional depth. The professional cuddler concept works particularly well as both literal profession and metaphor. However, the story occasionally sacrifices narrative flow to accommodate all elements, and some worldbuilding aspects feel underdeveloped despite their potential.</comment>
