<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kiera's character as a sincere rebel is well-established through her principled mission to preserve architectural traditions. Her motivation remains consistent throughout, and her confrontation with the mason's ghost reveals her courage and dedication. However, her emotional depth could be further developed beyond her professional commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with effective pacingâ€”from Kiera's entrance to her confrontation with the ghost to her successful acquisition of the ledger. The theorizing about whispered dates drives the action logically, and the resolution feels earned rather than contrived. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric writing creates a vivid, immersive setting. The haunted passage with its "constantly changing stains" and walls that "pulse with distant footsteps" establishes a richly sensory environment. The timeframe between storms creates perfect tension, and the physical setting metaphorically reinforces the theme of preservation versus impermanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs symbolism (the mason's shifting form representing impermanence) and creates meaningful subtext about tradition versus progress. The resolution satisfies emotionally while maintaining thematic integrity. The central conflict between preservation and erasure resonates beyond the immediate narrative, though some metaphors occasionally border on overworked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates originality in its premise and execution, some phrasing ("debt of suspense coiled around Kiera's ribcage") feels slightly overwrought. The writing occasionally indulges in unnecessarily complex constructions that draw attention to themselves rather than serving the narrative. However, the core concept and its execution remain fresh and compelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than contrived. The brevity serves the ghost story format well, creating intensity without sacrificing clarity. The lingering impression of tradition preserved through confronting fear demonstrates thoughtful thematic development, though occasional stylistic flourishes slightly diminish its overall impact.</comment>
