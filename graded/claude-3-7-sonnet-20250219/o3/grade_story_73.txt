<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mateo Cruz is effectively characterized through his steady, purposeful actions and his connection to ritual and preservation. His gravedigger identity shapes his approach to the supernatural events. However, his emotional depth remains somewhat underdeveloped, and his reaction to Dr. Lira's confession could have revealed more internal conflict to elevate the character beyond his functional role in the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves with clear purpose from discovery to confrontation to resolution, with the kindrelizing action serving as an effective climax. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with strong cause-and-effect relationships. The story's arc feels complete, though the introduction of Dr. Lira's confession feels slightly rushed given its significance to the plot's turning point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient Aztec elements with neon glass and holographic serpents creates a distinctive, liminal setting that perfectly embodies the "worlds overlapping" concept. Sensory details like "fluorescent lichen" and "obsidian stairways" effectively establish the atmosphere. The cemetery-temple connection is masterfully rendered, creating a space where the veil between worlds feels genuinely thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its lyrical prose and evocative imagery. The central theme of preservation against exploitation is effectively conveyed through both plot and metaphor. The ending provides satisfying resolution while maintaining mystical ambiguity. However, some metaphors ("eyes ringing with raucous silence") border on overwrought, and the story occasionally prioritizes poetic language over emotional clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates creative vision in its concept and setting, the prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("gravitic syllables," "eyes ringing with raucous silence"). Some phrases feel deliberately literary rather than authentic to the narrative. The handling of the supernatural elements is original, but certain descriptions rely on abstract language rather than concrete sensory detail, creating distance rather than immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The fusion of ancient ritual with futuristic elements creates a distinctive atmosphere, and the ethical conflict regarding cultural preservation resonates beyond the text. While occasionally prioritizing poetic language over narrative clarity, the story leaves readers with meaningful questions about cultural stewardship and the boundaries between worlds.</comment>
