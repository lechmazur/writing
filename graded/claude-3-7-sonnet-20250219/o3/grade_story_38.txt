<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morwen Crest is a compelling character whose insomnia visibly shapes her physical appearance ("eyes, ringed like planetary orbits") and connects to her poetic sensibility. Her motivation to preserve plant-based knowledge of non-violence is consistent with her characterization. However, the narrator remains underdeveloped, functioning primarily as a vessel for Morwen's story rather than a fully realized character with their own motivations for helping her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from subway encounter to attic resolution, with the elimination threat driving tension. The drunken confessions method cleverly subverts the antagonists' plans. However, the story rushes through critical developments in its final third, particularly how Morwen's confessions spread and force the shadowy funders to abandon their plans. This crucial turning point deserves more development within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the sterile subway and haunted attic creates a compelling atmospheric progression. Sensory details are exceptional—fluorescent hums, dust motes orbiting trunks, invisible shuffling feet, and the leaf "drinking dust like sunshine." The timeframe element brilliantly bookends the narrative, with the seed of peace traveling "between subway stops" both literally and metaphorically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively employs botanical metaphors for peace and violence, creating a cohesive thematic framework. The central conflict resolves satisfyingly through non-violent means, reinforcing the theme. However, the story occasionally tells rather than shows, particularly regarding the shadowy funders and their motivations. The final image of ghosts sipping tea is memorable but would benefit from more grounding in the established supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the prose contains fresh imagery ("eyes, ringed like planetary orbits"), it occasionally veers into purple territory with phrases like "incontrovertible, gentle thunder." The narrative relies on some convenient plot developments, particularly how quickly the antagonists abandon their plans. The story's originality lies in its botanical-supernatural premise, but the execution sometimes feels more concerned with poetic language than narrative coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear thematic purpose. The botanical samples, haunted attic, and subway setting work particularly well together. However, the brevity constrains full development of the antagonists and their motivations. The story leaves readers with the lingering image of ghosts sipping tea made from a truth-preserving plant—a memorable conclusion that effectively encapsulates the non-violence theme.</comment>
