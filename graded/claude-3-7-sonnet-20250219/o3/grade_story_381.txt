<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hushed necromancer Veyla is well-developed through her preference for whispers, her ethical stance against "domination," and her approach to necromancy as a form of communication rather than control. Her motivation to map caves while respecting them as entities with agency is consistent and reveals depth. However, Orren remains somewhat underdeveloped beyond his selenologist role and movie references, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from acoustic experiments to discovering the cave's consciousness to following its guidance. The story achieves a satisfying arc within its constraints, with clear cause-effect relationships as the characters negotiate with the cave system. The resolution feels earned when the cave accepts their partnership. The pacing effectively balances exposition, action, and reflection without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is exceptionally rendered through sensory details that transform it from mere backdrop to active participant. The quartz walls, phosphorescent lines, and glittering projections create a vivid atmosphere that perfectly supports the "futuristic nostalgia" tone. The timeframe "between sets" is cleverly integrated as both literal experimental intervals and metaphorical transitions between worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story skillfully explores themes of communication, partnership versus domination, and the living nature of seemingly inanimate spaces. The metaphor of necromancy as both scientific practice and artistic preservation creates rich subtext. The narrative shows rather than tells emotional states and builds to a satisfying conclusion that suggests continued exploration. The cave as co-author is a particularly effective metaphor that elevates the entire piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its approach to necromancy and cave exploration, avoiding predictable supernatural tropes. The language is precise without being purple, with fresh metaphors like "mineral parliament" and "celluloid coffins." While occasionally the prose becomes slightly too ornate ("phosphorescent lines ribboned through the air"), it generally maintains authenticity. The integration of film references feels organic rather than forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The brevity works to its advantage, creating a dreamlike quality that enhances the atmosphere. The narrative leaves readers with lingering questions about communication with non-human entities and the ethics of exploration. The story's greatest strength is how it transforms scientific mapping into a poetic negotiation between worlds.</comment>
