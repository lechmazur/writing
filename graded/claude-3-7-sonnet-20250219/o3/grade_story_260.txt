<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mallory Quill is well-developed through her cryptic crossword expertise, which naturally extends to her supernatural mission. Her motivation to help lost souls through wordplay is consistent and unique. Her methodical approach to unlocking whispers and creating puzzles reveals her meticulous nature, though we could benefit from more insight into her personal stakes in this mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Mallory's arrival to the souls' liberation, with the crossword puzzle creation driving the narrative forward. The story achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, with each action logically building toward the resolution. The central conflict of finding the missing word "home" creates perfect tension and resolution, though the transition from whisper collection to puzzle creation could be slightly smoother.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whisper collection point during a starless night creates an exquisitely atmospheric setting that enhances the supernatural elements. Sensory details like pages crackling "like tiny thunderclaps" and "luminous anagrams" swirling above create a vivid, immersive world. The connection between the ethereal whispers and the physical crossword grid on marble floors brilliantly bridges the metaphysical and tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story masterfully employs metaphor and symbolism, particularly in how wordplay becomes literal salvation. The central theme of reconciliation through language is profound and consistent. The emotional impact is significant as lost souls find peace through Mallory's linguistic intervention. The ending satisfies while maintaining mystery, though some dialogue from the spirits might have added another dimension to the emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of crossword puzzles as spiritual healing. The language is generally fresh, with evocative phrases like "semantic shelter" and "spectral remorse with earthly syntax." However, some descriptions like "noble chaos" feel slightly forced, and a few metaphors ("throbbed like a collective, repentant heart") verge on purple prose. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. The crossword puzzle concept serves as an elegant framework that naturally incorporates the various elements rather than feeling contrived. The brevity feels deliberate rather than limiting, allowing just enough space for the concept to unfold without unnecessary exposition. The lingering image of Mallory drafting a new clue suggests depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
