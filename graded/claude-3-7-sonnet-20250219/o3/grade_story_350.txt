<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcos is compellingly developed through his puppeteer identity, which elegantly extends to his manipulation of the wedding gown. His motivation to find his sister feels authentic and drives his actions consistently. The character's relationship with truth and deception creates psychological depth, though his emotional reactions could be more viscerally rendered rather than poetically described.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves with remarkable coherence from puzzle event to temple to revelation, with each element building logically toward the sister's message. The remodeling action through puppet-like manipulation of the gown creates a satisfying symmetry. Despite the brevity, the narrative achieves a complete arc with clear causality and resolution, though the middle section transitions could be smoother.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple setting is masterfully rendered with sensory details that evoke both ancient mystery and immediate presence. The "granular silence" and moonlit pillars create a liminal space perfectly suited for revelation. The atmosphere of abandoned worship mirrors Marcos's isolation while supporting the concept of hidden truths. The integration of setting with the character's emotional journey is particularly strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional resonance through its layered symbolismâ€”puppetry as control, stamps as messages, tears as music. The central theme of truth's preservation through artistic expression is elegantly sustained. The ending delivers both resolution and poignancy in Marcos's oath to "guard her silent symphony." Some metaphors occasionally strain credibility, but the overall impact remains powerful through showing rather than telling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its integration of puppetry with ancient mystery and familial bonds. The language is distinctive and avoids AI-typical patterns, with fresh metaphors like "silence felt granular." However, some phrases ("relief mixed with loneliness") default to telling emotional states, and certain descriptions ("irritatingly perfect") feel slightly forced rather than organic to the narrative voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends their individual constraints. The puppeteer's craft becomes both literal plot device and metaphor for control and revelation. While occasionally veering toward purple prose, the writing generally maintains a consistent tone that serves the emotional core. The lingering impression of sacrifice and protection gives the brief narrative surprising depth.</comment>
