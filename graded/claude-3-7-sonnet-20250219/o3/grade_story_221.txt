<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara Velez is exceptionally well-developed within the tight constraints. Her identity as a "reluctant ghost whisperer" and wreck-diver creates immediate intrigue, while her motivation to step out of her lineage's shadow feels authentic and drives her actions. Her relationship with her deceased mother adds emotional depth. The first-person narration establishes a distinctive voice that balances pragmatism with poetic sensibility. Minor weakness: we could use slightly more insight into how she developed her supernatural abilities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably cohesive for such a brief piece. The action of "arousing" voices drives the narrative perfectly, with clear cause-and-effect relationships as Mara uses the amber to communicate with spirits. The arc moves from arrival to communion with ghosts to resolution and departure with excellent pacing. The connection between the half-written letter and the carnival creates a compelling mystery that resolves satisfyingly when her mother's message is revealed. The story achieves a complete emotional journey within its constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery is masterfully rendered with sensory details that evoke both nostalgia and decay: "breeze smelt of brine and burnt sugar," "rust replaced laughter." The setting perfectly complements the supernatural elements while creating a liminal space between past and present. The timeframe—night transitioning to dawn—mirrors Mara's emotional journey. The atmosphere of "joyfully melancholic" permeates every description, creating a consistent mood that enhances the thematic exploration of family legacy and personal freedom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storytelling demonstrates exceptional craft through its layered symbolism (amber as preservation, thawing as emotional release) and evocative imagery. The prose achieves a delicate balance between lyricism and clarity. The central conflict between honoring family legacy and establishing individual identity resolves beautifully when Mara both acknowledges her ancestors and chooses to walk away. The theme of finding voice—both literally for the ghosts and metaphorically for Mara—emerges organically. The final line delivers a powerful thematic statement without being heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its concept and execution. The prose avoids clichés with fresh metaphors ("amber...warm as a small captured sun") and specific, vivid details. Emotions are conveyed through action and atmosphere rather than direct statements. The narrative maintains a consistent, distinctive voice throughout. The only minor weakness is occasional moments where the language becomes slightly too ornate ("arousing the imprisoned fly, whose wings flickered like clock springs restarting"), but these instances are rare and generally serve the story's ethereal tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, contributing to a unified narrative about inheritance, communication beyond death, and personal liberation. The brevity feels deliberate, creating a dreamlike quality that enhances the supernatural elements. The story demonstrates remarkable creativity in how it weaves together carnival imagery, diving metaphors, and ghostly communication. It leaves readers with lingering questions about family legacy and the nature of moving forward that extend beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
