<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The duelist's character is shaped by his cheerlessness and fatal flaws of arrogance and inability to forgive, creating a consistent motivation. His transformation through cooking as a metaphor for emotional healing shows depth. However, the character lacks distinctive voice and remains somewhat abstract, with emotional development told rather than fully demonstrated through specific actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the cooking/recipe metaphor to represent emotional transformation, with clear cause-effect relationships between the character's past and present actions. The narrative achieves a complete arc from isolation to reconciliation within the word limit. However, some transitions feel rushed, particularly the leap from discovering recipes to cooking the stew, which compresses what should be a pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting creates a powerful atmosphere of isolation that mirrors the character's emotional state. The juxtaposition of high-tech elements (server hums) with decay (peeling walls, cracked tiles) effectively reinforces themes of neglect and potential renewal. Sensory details like echoing footsteps and the chest's rattling create immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses cooking as metaphor for emotional healing, with strong symbolic elements (recipes as family bonds, ingredients as memories). The central conflict between pride and forgiveness is clear, with a satisfying resolution. However, the story occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them, and some metaphors become repetitive. The theme of reconciliation is well-developed but could benefit from more subtlety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the cooking metaphor is original, the language occasionally becomes overwrought ("elasticizing grief into a healing stew"). The emotional journey follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc. Several phrases feel formulaic ("bittersweet reckoning," "wavering resolve"). The story shows creativity in combining sci-fi elements with emotional healing but relies too heavily on explicitly stating the character's emotional realizations rather than revealing them through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements (space setting, cooking, family conflict) into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The metaphorical approach to forgiveness through cooking demonstrates creative thinking. However, some passages feel overwritten, with excessive adjectives and metaphors that occasionally obscure rather than illuminate the emotional core. The story leaves readers with meaningful reflections on reconciliation but could achieve this with more restraint.</comment>
