<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria's character as an exorcist with stage fright is well-established and consistent throughout. Her trembling hands, dry throat, and internal conflict about her family legacy create a compelling portrait. Her motivation to cleanse haunted metal while wrestling with her inheritance of lies feels authentic. However, her character could be deepened with more specific personal history or internal dialogue that reveals the origins of her stage fright rather than just stating it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Aria's initial trepidation to her eventual purposeful action. The submerging of the wildflowers drives the narrative forward logically. However, the story occasionally loses focus with tangential details about toy assembly that don't fully integrate with the main exorcism plot. The resolution feels somewhat rushed, with the actual exorcism process compressed into the final paragraphs without fully exploring the consequences or specifics of how her actions banish the "poltergeist."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized with "humming corridors," "stray satellites," and "metal husks drifting in silent voids." The atmosphere of isolation and haunted technology creates a perfect backdrop for an exorcism narrative. Sensory details like "steel-tinged air" and the hissing pressure of the hatch effectively immerse the reader. The juxtaposition of cosmic debris with delicate wildflowers creates a compelling tension that enhances the otherworldly mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (wildflowers dissolving as a metaphor for transformation) and creates emotional resonance through Aria's journey from fear to purpose. The central conflict between inherited duty and personal doubt is well-established. The prose is often lyrical with effective imagery like "petals swirl with coolant" and "each footfall reverberated like a drumbeat on her psyche." However, some metaphors feel slightly overwrought, and the theme of reclaiming one's truth from family deception could be more subtly integrated rather than explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its space-exorcist concept and the unusual combination of wildflowers with orbital debris. However, some phrases like "heart thundered" and "throat dry like ancient parchment" feel somewhat generic. The writing occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through action. While the prose is generally strong, there are moments of purple prose that detract from the narrative's impact. The story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but could benefit from more specific, unexpected details to elevate its authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive atmosphere and concept. The space station exorcism premise feels fresh, and the emotional journey of the protagonist carries weight. The brevity works well for establishing the scenario and character, though it limits full exploration of the world's mechanics and backstory. The lingering questions about Aria's family legacy and the nature of the hauntings provide depth beyond the explicit narrative, but some connections between elements (particularly the toy assembly and the exorcism) feel underdeveloped.</comment>
