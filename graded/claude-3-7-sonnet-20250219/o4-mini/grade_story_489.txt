<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The unseen observer has a clear motivation (rescuing ancient traditions) and the "aggressively kind" attribute shapes their actions, but character development remains limited. The observer's personality lacks dimension beyond their mission, and we get little insight into their background or internal conflicts. Their actions are consistent but predictable, and without dialogue or deeper introspection, they remain somewhat flat despite the atmospheric prose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc—from the observer's presence to the ritual's completion—but suffers from vague causality. The "fling" action propels the middle section effectively, but connections between events sometimes rely more on atmospheric suggestion than clear cause-effect relationships. The integration of the whale's call feels somewhat disconnected from the central action. While the story achieves closure, the exact mechanics of how the ritual works remain nebulous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly rendered with evocative sensory details—salt air, weathered beams, ghostly refrains. The atmosphere powerfully supports both the supernatural elements and the theme of preserving tradition. The integration of sea imagery with the lighthouse creates a cohesive world where the boundaries between past and present blur effectively. The setting doesn't merely house the story but actively participates in it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story effectively uses imagery and symbolism to create an ethereal, mystical atmosphere. The interplay between light/dark, past/present, and memory/myth creates compelling subtext. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by abstract language that occasionally prioritizes poetic phrasing over clarity. While the theme of preserving tradition emerges strongly, the story sometimes tells rather than shows the significance of the ritual being performed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The writing exhibits signs of formulaic construction—particularly in its reliance on ornate, adjective-heavy descriptions that sometimes prioritize lyricism over precision. Many sentences follow similar rhythmic patterns, creating a somewhat predictable cadence. While individual images are striking, the accumulation of ethereal, mystical language begins to feel generic rather than specific to this particular haunting. The emotional landscape remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about tradition and renewal. The lighthouse setting and ritual framework provide an effective structure for the supernatural elements. However, the prose sometimes prioritizes atmospheric description over narrative clarity, and certain connections (particularly regarding the whale's call) feel tenuous. While the story creates a haunting mood that lingers, it occasionally sacrifices specificity for poetic effect.</comment>
