<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alistair's character is established with the unique combination of being an "elegantly clumsy" elevator technician who sees ghosts, creating an intriguing foundation. His motivation to find liberation through letting go is consistent throughout. However, his character lacks deeper psychological exploration—we understand what he does but not enough about why he's drawn to ghosts or how his past shaped him. His actions align with his established traits, but his inner life remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from Alistair's ghost observations to his eventual liberation. The action of "dissecting" ghostly presences drives the narrative forward effectively. The story achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints, with the scattering of the flower crown petals providing a satisfying resolution symbolizing his freedom. However, the middle section could be tightened to create stronger cause-and-effect relationships between his ghost encounters and his ultimate liberation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab creates a distinctive, evocative setting that perfectly complements the themes of impermanence and letting go. The atmosphere of fragility and preservation contrasts beautifully with Alistair's journey toward release. Sensory details like "gusts of wind whispering through broken window seals" and "dripping wax from a fallen lantern" immerse the reader in this unique world. The "dissonance of silence" is palpably rendered throughout, creating a haunting mood that enhances the ghostly encounters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism, particularly with the dried flower crown representing both fragility and hope. The central theme of liberation through acceptance is well-developed, and the ending provides emotional satisfaction. The narrative successfully "shows" Alistair's transformation through concrete actions rather than merely telling. However, the conflict could be more clearly defined—what specifically is he struggling to let go of? The story occasionally relies on abstract concepts rather than grounding them in specific emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally falls into predictable patterns. Phrases like "his heart thudded with both dread and fascination" feel somewhat generic. The writing sometimes becomes overly ornate ("complex simplicity of his strange vocation"), suggesting an AI tendency toward purple prose. The emotional journey, while present, could benefit from more specific, nuanced reactions rather than somewhat formulaic descriptions of feelings. The story does maintain consistent tone and style throughout, which strengthens its authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The sand castle setting cleverly mirrors themes of impermanence, and Alistair's ghost-seeing abilities connect naturally to his journey toward liberation. The brevity works well for this atmospheric piece. While the story leaves readers with the lingering feeling of release that extends beyond the narrative, it could benefit from more specific details about what exactly Alistair is letting go of to deepen its emotional impact.</comment>
