<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fortune teller's character is well-established through her actions and the atmosphere surrounding her. Her motivation to "archive emotional patterns" drives her interactions consistently. However, her inner thoughts remain somewhat opaque, and while her "modestly flashy" attribute is mentioned, it doesn't fully develop into a distinctive personality trait that shapes her decisions throughout the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the fortune teller's arrival to her departure with collected secrets. The "unspoken offer" concept effectively drives tension, and the wine tasting method creates a natural gathering for divination. However, the zigzag action feels somewhat underutilized beyond a brief mention, and the resolution feels slightly rushed with limited exploration of consequences for those who shared their secrets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reimagined longhouse setting is richly detailed with carved beams, dragon motifs, and ash-laden boards that create an immersive atmosphere. The "overlooked era" timeframe enhances the mystical quality while sensory details like the hearth's glow and amber reflections create a vivid, cohesive world. The atmosphere perfectly complements both the character's mysterious nature and the secretive exchanges taking place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (amber preserving secrets like insects) and creates emotional resonance through the tension of unspoken exchanges. The theme of preserving human emotions as valuable artifacts emerges organically. However, the story relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than dramatic tension, and while beautifully written, it sometimes tells rather than shows the emotional impact of the fortune teller's work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the prose is evocative, it occasionally veers into overly ornate territory with phrases like "fierce repose" appearing multiple times. Some descriptions feel somewhat generic despite their poetic quality. The story avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but lacks the distinctive stylistic fingerprint of truly original work. The concept of collecting emotions in amber is creative, but the execution follows somewhat predictable mystical-encounter patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels purposeful rather than contrived. The brevity works well for this atmospheric piece, creating an enigmatic encounter that lingers in the mind. While some elements could be more deeply integrated, the overall effect is of a well-crafted vignette with mythic undertones that effectively captures a moment of mysterious exchange between the mundane and the mystical.</comment>
