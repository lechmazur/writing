<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's characterization as a "rattled exorcist" who is "inwardly social" creates an interesting tension, but her development feels somewhat static. Her motivation to "entwine science with wonder" drives her actions consistently, though her emotional journey lacks sufficient depth. The character's reactions to the puzzles reveal determination and expertise, but her inner conflicts could be more thoroughly explored beyond surface-level descriptions of physical reactions like "trembling" and "pulse quickened."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the puzzle-solving action to drive the narrative forward, creating a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The connection between the vintage postcard clue and the hidden room is well-established. The pacing accelerates appropriately through the puzzle sequence, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The cause-and-effect relationships between solving each puzzle and progressing toward the hidden room are logical and create effective tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting perfectly complements both the exorcist character and the supernatural/scientific tension. The juxtaposition of dance lessons against serious paranormal research creates a compelling dissonance. Sensory details like "fluorescent lamps," "stone floor," and "pulse resonating" effectively immerse the reader in this liminal space between science and the supernatural. The atmosphere successfully balances clinical sterility with mystical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the tension between empirical science and supernatural phenomena, creating thematic depth. The puzzle-solving sequence builds suspense well, though the emotional impact is somewhat muted by telling rather than showing the character's internal state. The ending offers a satisfying resolution that expands beyond the immediate plot to suggest broader implications. However, the writing occasionally relies on abstract statements rather than concrete imagery to convey meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose exhibits signs of formulaic construction, with several instances of unnecessarily ornate language ("coyly aggressive moment," "curated astonishment"). The narrative sometimes defaults to telling emotional states rather than showing them through action. While the concept is intriguing, the execution occasionally feels mechanical, particularly in the transitions between puzzle-solving sequences. The sensory details, while present, sometimes lack the specificity that would make them truly distinctive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The concept of bridging science and the supernatural provides a strong thematic foundation. However, the prose occasionally becomes overwrought, and some character development opportunities are missed in favor of plot progression. The story leaves readers with interesting questions about the intersection of empirical research and paranormal phenomena, though it could benefit from more nuanced character work.</comment>
