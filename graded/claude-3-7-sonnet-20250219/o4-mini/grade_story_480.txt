<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist has a distinctive concept but lacks psychological depth. His motivation to "feed curiosity with life's raw edge" is present but remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant. The character's actions align with his established traits, particularly his "indifferent enthusiasm," but we never truly understand what drives him beyond surface-level curiosity. The absence of dialogue limits our access to his inner world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the abandoned music hall to the climactic discovery in the mess hall, with the infiltration of secret clubs driving the narrative forward. The story achieves a sense of completeness within its constraints. However, the exact nature of the "digital exorcism" remains underdeveloped, and some causal relationships (particularly how the receipt connects to finding coordinates) feel more symbolic than logical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The atmospheric elements are the story's strongest feature. The abandoned mess hall, midnight bazaar, and underground club create a cohesive urban underworld. Sensory details like "damp concrete," "bass from the alley," and "neon halos" effectively establish a liminal, nocturnal atmosphere. The juxtaposition of digital technology with decaying physical spaces creates a compelling tension that enhances the concept of exorcising social media ghosts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story employs evocative imagery and creates an intriguing premise, but its impact is diluted by occasionally overwrought language. The central theme of seeking authentic experience in a digitally mediated world emerges clearly. The ending provides closure while maintaining mystery. However, the story relies too heavily on atmosphere at the expense of emotional stakes, and the conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The writing shows flashes of originality in its concept and imagery, but suffers from stylistic inconsistencies. Phrases like "indifferent enthusiasm" and "quietly loud" feel deliberately paradoxical rather than revealing genuine insight. The prose occasionally becomes purple ("hushed roar of discovery"), and the narrative relies on abstract descriptions rather than specific, concrete details. The character's actions follow a somewhat predictable pattern of urban exploration without surprising developments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a distinctive atmosphere. Its strengths lie in world-building and conceptual intrigue rather than character depth. While the premise is compelling, the execution sometimes prioritizes stylistic flourishes over emotional resonance. The brevity works in creating a snapshot of an enigmatic figure, but leaves the reader wanting more substantive exploration of the protagonist's inner world and the consequences of his digital exorcisms.</comment>
