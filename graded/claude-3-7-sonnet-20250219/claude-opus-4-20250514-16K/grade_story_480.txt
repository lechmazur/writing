<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya is effectively characterized through her unique profession and methods. Her backstory ("she'd once been trapped too") provides motivation, and her "indifferent enthusiasm" shapes her approach. However, we could use more emotional depth or internal conflict to fully understand what drives her beyond the basic premise. Her character has a distinct voice and function but lacks the complexity that would make her truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with the ritual preparation, client arrival, exorcism process, and resolution. The concept of digital exorcism drives the narrative logically, with cause-effect relationships maintained throughout. The story achieves a satisfying sense of completeness within its constraints. However, the actual mechanics of the exorcism could be more specifically detailed to strengthen the plot's central action sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned music and mess halls create a powerful atmosphere of institutional decay that perfectly complements the theme of digital detox. Sensory details are strong ("reeked of forgotten meals and institutional despair") and evocative. The setting functions as both physical space and metaphor for abandoned analog existence. The contrast between digital ghosts and physical ruins creates a rich thematic resonance throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story effectively explores the tension between digital and analog existence through compelling metaphors ("digital confetti") and symbolism (burning receipt). The central conflict between authentic experience and performative living is well-established. The ending provides satisfaction while maintaining thematic resonance. The story successfully "shows" rather than "tells" through atmospheric details and ritualistic actions rather than exposition. The digital exorcism concept invites deeper reflection on contemporary relationships with technology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story presents an original premise with the concept of a "social media exorcist." The narrative avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, maintaining consistent tone and style. However, certain phrases like "indifferent enthusiasm" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient explanation, and the exorcism process relies more on telling than showing in places. Some descriptions ("eyes bright with analog wonder") edge toward purple prose. The story would benefit from more specific, idiosyncratic details about Maya's techniques to elevate it beyond its clever concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that feels purposeful rather than constrained. The social commentary on digital identity provides depth beyond the explicit narrative. The premise is thought-provoking and the atmosphere compelling. While the core concept is strong, some elements feel slightly underutilized or could be more deeply integrated. Nevertheless, the story achieves an impressive balance between meeting assignment requirements and delivering a meaningful narrative with contemporary relevance.</comment>
