His internal conflict regarding his sister's blindness creates authentic motivation, though his transition could be slightly more gradual. The swordsman's pride and guilt are effectively revealed through both dialogue and internal reflection, giving him psychological depth despite the brevity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable coherence within its tight constraints, moving from confrontation to resolution with clear causality. The authorization quest drives the plot naturally, with the traditional song creating an elegant turning point. The ending effectively resolves the central conflict while opening new possibilities. A slight weakness is the somewhat compressed emotional journey that might benefit from more gradual development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard provides an exceptional contrast to the swordsman's identity, creating tension through opposition of values. Morning mist, rice paper, and ink create vivid sensory details that establish contemplative atmosphere.

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional resonance through masterful subtext and symbolism. The contrast between sword and brush, sight and blindness, arrogance and humility creates layers of meaning that transcend the surface narrative.

Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, each exchange weighted with significance beyond its literal meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates strong originality in its exploration of Eastern philosophical themes without resorting to stereotypes. Metaphors like "his voice cutting through morning mist" feel fresh and specific to the character. The emotional journey avoids stating feelings directly, instead revealing them through actions and reactions. Some phrasing occasionally feels slightly overwrought ("weathered stone and silent ink"), but generally maintains authenticity and nuance.</comment>
