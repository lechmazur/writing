<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The exiled prince's character is well-developed through his isolation and healing abilities. His motivation to cure loneliness feels authentic, and his reaction to the apothecary's apprentice reveals vulnerability beneath his mysterious persona. However, his "voice" lacks distinctiveness in the limited dialogue, and the transition from wanderer to settler feels slightly rushed given his established nomadic nature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the snowstorm to create the chance encounter that drives the narrative. The arc from isolation to connection is clear and satisfying, with the mortar and pestle serving as both practical tool and metaphorical device. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the resolution feels slightly accelerated in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office provides an evocative liminal space that perfectly mirrors the prince's transitional state. Sensory details (snow whipping, dust motes dancing, pale light) create a palpable atmosphere of isolation transforming to intimacy. The connection between setting and objects is meaningful, with the storm serving as both physical barrier and catalyst for change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs symbolism through the mortar and pestle representing connection, and the key representing transition. The central theme of healing extends beyond physical remedies to emotional wounds, creating resonant subtext. Dialogue feels purposeful, and the ending offers satisfying resolution while maintaining emotional depth. The narrative effectively shows rather than tells the prince's emotional journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids obvious AI markers, phrases like "loneliness pressed against his ribs like a physical weight" and the somewhat formulaic healing-outcast narrative edge toward familiar territory. The metaphor of locking away the past is functional but not entirely fresh. However, the emotional arc feels genuine, with consistent tone and thoughtful integration of the assigned elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story succeeds in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that reads as intentional rather than constrained. The metaphorical connections between healing, tools, and human connection elevate the piece beyond its literal plot. While occasionally leaning on familiar tropes, the narrative leaves readers with a lingering emotional resonance about isolation and connection that transcends its brief length.</comment>
