<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's character effectively embodies the "no-nonsense empathic blacksmith" identity. Her empathic abilities with spirits and practical approach to her ritual work well together. However, her personal stakes and inner conflicts remain somewhat underdeveloped - we understand what she does but have limited insight into her own emotional journey beyond her functional role. The character would benefit from more exploration of how her dual nature (practical blacksmith/sensitive empath) creates internal tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure skillfully weaves the action of mollifying spirits through the ritual with the stained glass ornament. The narrative creates a satisfying arc from unrest to resolution within the word constraint. The causality is clear, and the pacing effectively builds tension before release. The only weakness is that the stakes feel somewhat abstract rather than urgent - while ghosts are restless, the specific consequences of failure aren't entirely clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum creates an exceptionally immersive atmosphere that perfectly complements the post-human timeframe. Sensory details like the hammer's rhythm, moonlight through cracked windows, and glowing miniature rooms create a vivid, ethereal setting. The juxtaposition of the tiny Victorian parlors with the vast timespan creates an effective emotional resonance, highlighting both intimacy and eternity. The world-building is the story's strongest element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storytelling effectively uses the heartbeat motif (thud-THUD) to connect the blacksmith's craft with human connection across time. The emotional impact is strong, with the central theme of persistence after death resonating throughout. The writing shows sophistication in its use of imagery and rhythm. While the story delivers its emotional payload effectively, it occasionally lapses into telling rather than showing emotional states, particularly in the final paragraph where the theme becomes more explicitly stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns and maintains a distinctive voice. The imagery of the dollhouse rooms illuminating as spirits find peace is original and evocative. However, certain phrases ("the peculiar, persistent miracle of human connection") feel slightly generic, and the ending somewhat overexplains the thematic significance rather than letting it emerge naturally. The writing occasionally becomes more explicitly thematic than necessary, reducing subtlety in favor of clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole that feels organic rather than forced. The blacksmith's craft, the dollhouse setting, and the post-human timeframe work in harmony to explore themes of memory, connection, and preservation. The brevity feels appropriate for the ghostly encounter depicted. What prevents a higher score is that the conclusion leans toward explicit thematic statements rather than allowing ambiguity, slightly reducing the story's literary sophistication.</comment>
