<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lin Wei's characterization as a chameleon actor is well-developed through her ability to transform into multiple personas during her performance. Her rationally impulsive nature manifests in her calculated emotional performances followed by instinctive character shifts. The character has a distinct purpose and methodology, though her personal stakes beyond professional achievement could be more deeply explored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses Lin's performance to unravel the mystery, with logical cause-and-effect progression from discovery of the dress to revelation of the child's fate. The story achieves a satisfying arc with setup, investigation, revelation, and reflection. The pacing effectively balances exposition and action, though the final revelation feels slightly rushed compared to the build-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Chinese palace creates a richly layered setting that bridges past and future, perfectly complementing the theme of uncovering historical truths. The "sunlight through debris" imagery effectively symbolizes illuminating buried secrets. Sensory details—vermillion corridors, lacquered columns, moonlight replacing sun—create an immersive atmosphere where ancient grandeur meets decay, reinforcing the story's themes of transformation and preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully explores themes of truth, memory, and emotional archaeology through Lin's unique ability to channel historical figures. The central metaphor of performance as a bridge between past and present carries significant weight. The narrative effectively "shows" Lin's transformations through specific physical and vocal details rather than merely telling about her abilities. The ending offers meaningful reflection beyond the immediate mystery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates originality in its post-oil world concept and the theatrical method of solving cold cases. Language is generally purposeful without becoming purple prose. Some metaphors (walls exhaling, dress as prayer flag) feel slightly overreaching. The emotional transitions between Lin's performance states and her personal realizations are handled with nuance, though occasionally the exposition becomes slightly too explicit rather than allowing readers to infer connections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive narrative where each element enhances rather than constrains the story. The blend of mystery, historical fiction, and speculative elements creates a distinctive atmosphere. The dual nature of performance and investigation provides thematic depth beyond the surface plot. The brevity works in service of the story's impact rather than limiting it.</comment>
