<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exorcist's inner conflict between faith and science is effectively portrayed through trembling hands and guarded demeanor. His character attribute of being "inwardly social" manifests naturally in his craving for connection while maintaining professional distance. Marcus's reaction to the postcard reveals his traumatic past without explicit exposition. However, his motivation could be better layered throughout rather than primarily revealed in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The puzzle mechanism elegantly drives the narrative forward, with each revelation building tension. The dance serves as both literal action and metaphor for the characters' relationship. Despite brevity, the story achieves a satisfying arc from initial antagonism to collaborative understanding. The connection between Prague's past events and current research creates coherent causality. The synthesis of faith and science progresses logically through physical movement and intellectual discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The psychic research facility's dance studio creates a brilliant juxtaposition of clinical science and artistic expression. The mirrors with hidden symbols transform an ordinary space into something mysterious. Sensory details—tango music, swaying lab coat, warm postcard—create immersive atmosphere. The facility becomes a liminal space where empiricism and faith can coexist, perfectly supporting the story's thematic concerns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story masterfully employs the dance as both literal action and extended metaphor for the relationship between faith and science. Dialogue reveals character without exposition. The central conflict between empirical evidence and spiritual experience resolves into mutual understanding. The ending achieves poignancy through restraint: "each revelation a small exorcism." Subtext runs throughout, with physical movements mirroring emotional states, creating depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative avoids common AI pitfalls with consistent tone and natural progression. Metaphors feel fresh ("each revelation a small exorcism"). However, Elena's character shifts somewhat abruptly from predatory to vulnerable. The phrase "two broken people, circling each other" veers toward cliché. The story's thematic statement about "wonder and science" being "different languages for the same haunted dance" demonstrates originality but borders on overly explicit theme-stating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates all assigned elements into a cohesive whole that transcends the sum of its parts. The dance setting cleverly enables both literal and metaphorical movements. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constrained, with each word serving multiple purposes. Elements like the vintage postcard evolve from props to pivotal story components. The final image of the dance as shared language leaves a lingering philosophical question about reconciling faith and empiricism.</comment>
