<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The character development of Mira as an aloof orphan who gradually opens up is executed with solid emotional resonance. Her journey from self-protection to vulnerability is psychologically coherent, though her transformation feels slightly accelerated within the constraints. Her orphan status meaningfully informs her defensive posture, and the story effectively shows how her walls gradually come down through her interaction with the anomaly and stones. The connection between her past abandonment issues and her ultimate decision to "let go" creates a satisfying character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively utilizes the gravitational anomaly as both literal and metaphorical device, creating a coherent arc from resistance to acceptance. The story achieves a clear beginning (discovery), middle (intensification), and resolution (surrender/transformation) within the word limit. The connection between the cryptic message and Mira's emotional journey is well-established. However, the mechanics of how the garage ultimately detaches completely feels somewhat rushed, and the transition from cleaning to floating away could benefit from slightly more development to maintain full coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a distinctive, immersive setting that perfectly complements the emotional journey. Physical details like floating tools, swirling dust patterns, and the garage's groaning foundation vividly establish both the physics and atmosphere. The anomaly serves as an effective metaphor for Mira's emotional state while remaining convincing as a concrete phenomenon. The stones' immunity to the anomaly's pull creates meaningful contrast that enhances both the setting and the symbolic layer, making this aspect particularly strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story skillfully employs the gravitational anomaly as a metaphor for Mira's emotional journey, creating a thoughtful meditation on control, surrender, and personal growth. The imagery of floating objects paired with emotional defenses creates effective symbolism. The ending achieves poignancy through Mira's transformation from fear to acceptance. While dialogue is absent, the interior journey is well-rendered. The central theme of needing to surrender control to move forward emerges organically from the narrative and resonates beyond the immediate story. The emotional arc feels earned rather than forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its central conceit and metaphorical framework. The gravitational anomaly provides fresh metaphorical terrain, and the story avoids predictable emotional beats. However, some phrasing ("understanding blooming in her chest," "genuine joy") verges on telling rather than showing emotions. The conclusion, while thematically satisfying, follows a somewhat predictable transformation arc. The prose occasionally relies on abstract emotional statements rather than specific sensory details. Still, the core concept and execution avoid major clich√©s and maintain a consistent, thoughtful tone throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole with emotional and thematic resonance. The gravitational anomaly serves both plot and metaphor effectively, while the character's orphan status meaningfully informs her emotional journey. The central metaphor of letting go works on multiple levels without feeling heavy-handed. While some emotional transitions could be more gradually developed, and certain phrases trend toward telling rather than showing, the overall effect is a compelling, thoughtful piece that leaves the reader with lingering questions about control, surrender, and personal transformation.</comment>
