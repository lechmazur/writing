<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is effectively characterized through his elegant clumsiness and unique ghost-seeing ability. His journey from observer to someone who understands when to let go shows growth. However, his personality remains somewhat skeletal—we understand his situation and motivation better than we understand him. His voice lacks distinctive qualities, and his emotional responses to the ghosts could be more nuanced beyond curiosity and eventual understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates impressive coherence within its constraints. Marcus's discovery that the preservation process captures memories in sand leads naturally to his decision to return the flower crown, creating a satisfying resolution. The causal connections are logical, and the pacing effectively balances exposition and action. The dissection of ghost patterns provides a clear middle section that bridges the initial observation with the final insight about letting go.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is brilliantly realized, creating a unique setting that feels both whimsical and uncanny. The atmospheric elements—particularly the "dissonance of silence" and the underwater pressure on eardrums—create a palpable sense of otherworldliness. Sensory details like the faint perfume of roses and sea salt bring pivotal moments to life. The setting perfectly complements both the ghostly concept and Marcus's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively builds to a meaningful thematic revelation about knowing "when to stop looking" and finding "liberation in letting go." The metaphor of preservation capturing final moments works on multiple levels. The ending provides both narrative closure and philosophical resonance with its observation that "not every echo needed an answer." While dialogue is absent, the interior focus suits the story's contemplative nature. The story demonstrates sophisticated "showing" rather than "telling" throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its coherent narrative progression and consistent tone. Its originality shines in the imaginative concept of preserved sand castles capturing memories. However, some phrasings feel slightly overwrought ("the metal clanging against the elevator shaft with an elegance only the genuinely clumsy possess"), and the emotional language occasionally slips toward telling rather than showing. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive stylistic fingerprint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative. The concept of ghost-populated sand castles feels inventive rather than contrived. The story's conclusion offers genuine insight about letting go, demonstrating depth beyond its surface elements. While some minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent it from reaching perfection, it achieves a rare balance of conceptual originality and emotional resonance within tight constraints.</comment>
