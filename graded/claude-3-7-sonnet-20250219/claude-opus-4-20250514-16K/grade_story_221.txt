<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-defined through her relationship to her family's supernatural tradition and her growing desire for independence. Her motivation to break from the family's focus on maritime necromancy to connect with "landlocked drowning" shows significant character depth. The joyfully melancholic attribute manifests naturally in her simultaneous sorrow and freedom. However, her internal conflict could be more deeply explored within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marina's decision to break tradition with her emergence as "a different kind of ghost whisperer." The narrative achieves remarkable coherence within its constraints, moving from Marina's initial hesitation to her transformation by dawn. The amber pendant serves as both catalyst and symbolic guide. The story presents a complete arc from familial confinement to personal awakening with well-managed pacing that never feels rushed despite its density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creates a hauntingly immersive atmosphere that perfectly bridges the maritime and landlocked worlds. The setting functions brilliantly as both literal location and metaphorical crossroads. Sensory details—"barnacle-crusted gallery," "cotton candy ghosts," "salt breeze"—create a vivid liminal space where joy and grief, preservation and release coexist. The carnival's underwater graveyard perfectly embodies Marina's psychological journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling achieves remarkable depth through layered symbolism—the amber-trapped insect paralleling Marina's own entrapment in tradition, the shooting gallery's rusted ducks as silent witnesses. The thematic exploration of inheritance, duty, and self-discovery resonates beyond the narrative's supernatural elements. The prose demonstrates sophisticated control, particularly in the final paragraph where Marina's "rebellious bloom" culminates the story's emotional arc. The subtext of preservation versus liberation enriches every element.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story largely avoids AI-typical patterns, showing authentic emotional complexity and original imagery. The concept of "maritime necromancy" and "landlocked drowning" represents genuinely innovative supernatural worldbuilding. Some phrases like "painful, necessary thaw" and "stepping out of the shadow into her own strange light" edge toward predictability, but the story generally maintains distinctive voice throughout. The amber mosquito metaphor is particularly fresh and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>This story demonstrates remarkable cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. Each element feels essential rather than forced, particularly the connection between the amber pendant and Marina's transformation. The prose balances lyrical qualities with narrative clarity. The brevity works as a strength, creating a haunting, dreamlike quality appropriate to the supernatural content. The ending achieves both resolution and lingering resonance, leaving the reader with Marina's awakening poised between worlds.</comment>
