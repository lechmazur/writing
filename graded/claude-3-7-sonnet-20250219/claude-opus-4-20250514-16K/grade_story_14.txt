<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's naivety as a gambler is effectively established through her persistent hope despite losses and her delayed understanding of the game's true purpose. Her slow realization that they're playing for emotional reasons rather than material stakes reveals meaningful character growth. However, secondary characters remain somewhat flat, serving more as thematic vehicles than fully developed individuals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the failing station with the crew's gambling ritual, creating a poignant metaphor for their powerlessness. The structure moves organically from establishing the ritual to revealing its true significance. The "docking" of hazard pay creates a meaningful parallel with their impending unemployment. The story achieves remarkable completeness within its constraints, though the midnight lectures feel slightly disconnected from the main narrative arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station provides both literal and metaphorical resonance, with the relentless waves mirroring the inevitable economic forces crushing the characters. Sensory details are exceptional—flickering candles, clattering dice, crashing waves—creating a vivid atmosphere of desperate warmth amid encroaching darkness. The physical environment perfectly embodies the emotional landscape of the characters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves profound thematic depth through its exploration of futile resistance against inevitable change. The gambling metaphor brilliantly captures both economic precarity and human dignity in the face of obsolescence. The final image of the candle flame reflected in tears while laughing delivers emotional complexity that transcends the word count. The story skillfully shows rather than tells, though the professor's explanatory rant risks momentarily disrupting this approach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids common AI pitfalls with its consistent tone and emotionally nuanced characters. The gambling metaphor feels fresh rather than clichéd, and the prose maintains distinctive style throughout. However, some descriptions ("laughing through tears") rely on somewhat generic emotional signifiers, and certain phrases ("they traded their futures for these fleeting moments") edge toward overly explanatory territory that diminishes the otherwise excellent showing-not-telling approach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story masterfully integrates its assigned elements into a coherent whole that transcends their individual requirements. The thematic exploration of human dignity amid technological obsolescence achieves remarkable depth for the word count. The emotional complexity of finding joy and community while facing inevitable loss resonates beyond the page. Minor weaknesses in secondary character development and occasional explanatory tendencies prevent a higher score, but this is nonetheless accomplished literary fiction.</comment>
