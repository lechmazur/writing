<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vex has a distinct identity as a necromancer with controlled whispers, but her personality remains relatively surface-level. The connection to her grandfather through the baseball cap provides emotional depth, yet her motivation beyond mapping caves feels underdeveloped. Her whispered communication with the dead shows her method aligns with her necromancer identity, but we need more insight into her internal conflicts or growth to make her fully three-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear framework—Vex mapping caves using necromancy—but lacks a distinct conflict or dramatic tension. While the structure includes a beginning (setup of the mapping session), middle (discovery of spectral anomaly), and end (resolution to continue mapping), the narrative arc feels somewhat static. The connection between mapping caves and hearing "the sound of resolve" in crystals needs stronger causality to elevate the story's cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is richly realized through bioluminescent energy, quantum properties, and ghostly resonance. The 23rd century timeframe with terraformed colonies creates a believable futuristic context while maintaining human connection through relics of the past. Sensory details like the cave's natural resonance and the flickering quantum crystals create an immersive atmosphere that effectively balances technological advancement with supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the metaphor of whispers and silence to connect necromancy with respect for the dead, creating thoughtful subtext about remembrance. The thematic exploration of carrying the past forward while building humanity's future shows depth. However, the story lacks a compelling central conflict that would heighten emotional impact. The movie-referencing mapping technique is clever but doesn't fully pay off narratively within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The integration of futuristic technology with supernatural necromancy feels fresh, and the cataloguing system using movie references shows originality. However, some descriptions verge on purple prose ("spectral energies," "crystalline formations"), and the emotional climax feels somewhat predictable. The story avoids major AI-writing red flags but could better subvert tropes of both necromancy and space colonization narratives to achieve greater authenticity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates diverse elements—necromancy, futuristic technology, nostalgia, and cave exploration—into a cohesive whole. The quantum properties of the crystals ingeniously connect to the necromantic abilities and the concept of preserving the past. While the brevity works for establishing the world and character, it limits development of meaningful conflict. The lingering thought about honoring the dead while expanding humanity offers thematic resonance that elevates the piece beyond its surface narrative.</comment>
