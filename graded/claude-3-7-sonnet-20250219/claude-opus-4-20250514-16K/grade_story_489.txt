<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya has clear motivation to preserve tradition, but her character lacks depth beyond this single-minded purpose. The unseen observer presents interesting potential but remains underdeveloped - more shadow than substance. Maya's connection to ancestral duty is established well, but her personal stakes and internal conflict are only lightly sketched. We don't get enough sense of who she is beyond her ceremonial role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a complete arc within its constraints, from the threat of demolition to the preservation of the lighthouse. The causal relationships flow logically, and the ritual dance as catalyst works effectively. However, the resolution comes too easily - the townspeople's sudden collective epiphany feels convenient rather than earned through dramatic tension or meaningful conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly established and integrates perfectly with the themes of preservation and ancestral wisdom. Sensory elements are particularly strong - the whale's vibrations through stone, the Atlantic's "ancient rhythms," and the shimmer of lighthouse walls create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The liminal space between land and sea effectively mirrors the story's exploration of the boundary between tradition and progress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively explores themes of tradition versus modernity and collective memory. The whistle transforming into something profound works as both plot device and metaphor. However, the writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotional impact ("understanding suddenly what would be lost"), and the conflict resolves too neatly without sufficient resistance or cost. The central idea is compelling but would benefit from more nuanced execution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative contains several predictable elements typical of preservationist tales, including the "last keeper of tradition" trope and the too-neat resolution. Phrases like "brazen calm" and "aggressively kind" feel forced rather than organic. The prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("undercurrent of wisdom that flows beneath progress"). While the lighthouse-whale connection offers originality, the story's arc follows a conventional structure without significant subversion or surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements with reasonable cohesion, particularly in how it weaves the setting, character motivation, and central conflict. Its strengths lie in atmosphere and thematic clarity. However, it sacrifices narrative tension for symbolic resonance, and character development is subordinated to the preservation message. The writing has moments of lyrical beauty but would benefit from more restraint and narrative complication to achieve true literary distinction.</comment>
