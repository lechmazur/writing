<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed through his controlled "peaceful anger" that drives his calculated revenge. His motivation to restore justice through subtle means rather than violence is psychologically consistent and morally complex. However, his character could be further enriched through more personal struggle or ethical questioning to reach literary excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's card games to his gradual dismantling of power structures. The hydrolysis method creates a satisfying cause-effect relationship, and the narrative achieves a complete arc from summer to autumn. The revolution's natural progression mirrors the firefly imagery effectively, though the ultimate consequences could be explored with more nuance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds create a luminous, evocative backdrop that perfectly contrasts with and symbolically enhances Marcus's subtle revenge. The phosphorescent imagery against darkness mirrors his methods brilliantly. Sensory details like "fireflies pulsed in darkness" and the seasonal progression from summer to autumn create a vivid atmosphere that reinforces the themes of natural transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves depth through its exploration of justice, power, and ethical revenge. The extended metaphor of "transformation through tender dissolution" elevates the narrative beyond its plot. The fireflies function as potent symbols for both illumination and ephemeral beauty. While the emotional stakes could be heightened, the story effectively shows rather than tells Marcus's motivations and achieves thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its concept of chemical memory erasure as gentle revenge. Fresh metaphors like "revenge served with inexorable grace of nature" avoid clich√©. The narrative maintains consistency of tone and demonstrates authorial control. Some phrases ("true power lay not in...") tip slightly toward predictable literary wisdom, but overall the writing feels purposeful rather than formulaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole, particularly in how the firefly setting enhances themes of illumination and natural cycles. The brevity feels deliberate rather than constraining. The lingering image of fireflies "writing their own ancient stories in light" demonstrates depth beyond the explicit narrative. A touch more emotional complexity would elevate it to top-tier literary quality.</comment>
