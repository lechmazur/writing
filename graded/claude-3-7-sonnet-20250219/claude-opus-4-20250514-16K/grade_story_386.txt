<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marya's motivation is clearly established through her determination to preserve her civilization's memory, and her quietly defiant nature manifests well in her actions. Her relationship with the keeper reveals her trustworthy strange nature without explicitly stating it. However, we could benefit from a slightly deeper glimpse into her internal struggle or more specific details about her past to fully round out her character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc with well-established stakes and resolution. The "catapult" action drives her arrival in this timeline, and the method "by alignment of stars" creates logical tension and deadline. The narrative achieves remarkable coherence in limited space, with the opening setup leading naturally to the climactic memory-gathering and meaningful resolution that transforms both Marya and the lighthouse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-utilized, functioning both literally and metaphorically. The timeframe of "a line that never moves" creates a haunting liminality that permeates the story. Sensory details like the glowing tablecloth threads, luminous memory-moths, and the transformation of harsh light to soft radiance create a vivid, otherworldly atmosphere that perfectly complements the temporal themes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable emotional resonance through its central metaphor of light as memory and preservation. The lighthouse's transformation mirrors Marya's own journey from refugee to guardian of cultural memory. The dialogue is sparse but impactful, particularly the final exchange that underscores the theme. The bittersweet ending feels earned and resonant, leaving the reader with a powerful image of ships guided by memory-light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story shows originality in its time-refugee concept and the novel use of embroidery as a temporal map. However, some metaphors ("tears traced her cheeks") veer toward the conventional, and certain phrases ("Your empire lives on") feel slightly predictable. The writing generally avoids purple prose, though a few passages like "luminous moths" and "borrowed dawn" verge on overly poetic. The emotional core remains authentic despite these occasional flourishes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative skillfully integrates multiple assigned elements into a coherent whole that feels organic rather than forced. The temporal boundaries, memory preservation, and transformation themes create depth beyond the surface narrative. While occasionally teetering on the edge of being too conceptual, the story grounds itself in Marya's emotional journey and concrete images like the tablecloth and lighthouse beam, creating a satisfying balance between abstract concepts and tangible storytelling.</comment>
