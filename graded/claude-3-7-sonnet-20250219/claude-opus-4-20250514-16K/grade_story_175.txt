<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Corvus is well-established through his actions and motivations. His calculated approach to revealing truth shows consistency with his character. However, while we understand his mission, we lack deeper emotional insight into his personal stakes or internal conflicts that would elevate him beyond his functional role in the narrative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot moves with clear purpose from setup to revelation. The narrative efficiently establishes the stakes, builds tension through Corvus's preparations, and delivers a meaningful resolution with the villagers' awakening. The causality between Corvus's actions and their consequences is logical and well-paced within the constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom village creates a distinctive, immersive setting that perfectly supports the themes of deception and revelation. Sensory details like the pulsing houses and moonlight on brass cage bars create a vivid, dreamlike atmosphere that enhances the ritual's significance and the subsequent shattering of illusions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses extended metaphors (particularly the chipping paint as falling notes/coordinates) to deepen its themes of hidden truth. The central conflict between tradition and freedom is resolved with satisfying impact. However, the narrative could further develop its subtext through more nuanced character reactions to achieve greater emotional depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise of a truth-revealing minstrel liberating a deceived village is inventive, some descriptions ("savage grace," "feral elegance") feel artificially poetic. The narrative occasionally relies on explicitly stated symbolism rather than allowing readers to discover connections organically. Several metaphors, while effective, are constructed with a similar pattern that creates a slightly formulaic quality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic depth. The mushroom village, empty birdcage, and crumbling illusions work together to create a meaningful exploration of truth versus deception. Though some prose tends toward the ornate, the overall execution demonstrates creative vision and leaves readers with provocative questions about tradition versus freedom.</comment>
