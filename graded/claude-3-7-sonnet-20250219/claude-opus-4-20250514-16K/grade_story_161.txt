<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus's vigilance and precision transfer effectively from orchardist to investigator, creating a coherent character whose meticulous nature drives the plot. His motivation—avenging his daughter—is clear and powerful. However, his emotional journey feels somewhat static; his sardonic glee remains constant rather than evolving, and we get limited psychological depth beyond his focused determination. His voice lacks distinctive qualities that would make him truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient and coherent, with Marcus's discovery of the peacock seal creating a clear climactic revelation. The cause-effect relationship between his investigation and the conspiracy's unraveling is logical. However, the resolution feels somewhat rushed—the immediate arrest of executives compresses what should be a complex process into a single line, sacrificing narrative tension. The peacock code reveals are compelling but would benefit from more gradual development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility provides an effective backdrop that connects thematically to the daughter's aviation accident. The sterile corridors contrast nicely with Marcus's orchard background, highlighting his outsider status. The sardonic tone creates a tense atmosphere that complements the conspiracy theme. However, sensory details are limited, with minimal description of how the facility looks, sounds, or feels, missing opportunities to enhance immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the orchard/harvest metaphor throughout, creating resonant symbolism between Marcus's two worlds. The final line—"the harvest tasted of ashes and vindication"—delivers emotional impact through evocative imagery. The narrative builds tension through Marcus's gradual discoveries, and the peacock code creates intriguing subtext. However, the story would benefit from deeper exploration of ethical questions about vigilante justice and whether vengeance brings closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the peacock seal as conspiracy marker shows creative thinking, the investigation and conspiracy unraveling follow predictable patterns. The corporate conspiracy trope lacks original dimensions, and the executives' swift downfall feels formulaic. Phrases like "his pulse quicken" and "the tree of his life" are somewhat generic. The story does maintain consistent tone throughout, but Marcus's emotional journey lacks the nuance and contradiction that would make it feel more authentically human.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements cohesively, particularly connecting the orchardist background to investigative skills. The peacock pattern device cleverly ties multiple elements together. While the brevity sometimes limits character depth, the narrative feels complete. The strongest aspect is the thematic consistency—vigilance and precision transfer meaningfully from orchard to investigation. The ending effectively balances resolution with emotional ambiguity, suggesting that justice doesn't heal all wounds.</comment>
