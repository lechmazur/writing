<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Morgana is distinctly characterized through her occupation, family history, and mission. Her "glamorous undertaker" persona is well-integrated with her digital preservation work. Her patience is effectively shown through waiting "three years for someone to understand her mission." However, her emotional complexity could be further developed—we understand her mission but not her deeper personal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively from introduction to rising action to resolution. The action of "elongating" digital lives forms the central plot mechanism with clear cause-effect relationships. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints, moving from Morgana's work routine to specific preservation of Marcus Chen's profile to her broader mission, with effective pacing that balances exposition and action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is richly rendered and perfectly complements the themes of preservation and death. The juxtaposition of ancient family practices with digital technology creates a compelling atmosphere. Sensory details are particularly strong—the glinting measuring tape, mixing paints, and "seafoam green, the color of new beginnings"—creating a mystical yet concrete world where the supernatural and technological intersect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story effectively uses digital preservation as metaphor for honoring overlooked human value. Strong symbolic elements include the measuring tape that "measures immeasurable worth" and paint mixing as transformation. The conflict between algorithm-determined value versus human-determined worth resonates emotionally. The thematic exploration of ordinary lives containing extraordinary moments creates depth beyond plot mechanics, though dialogue is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept of a digital undertaker is fresh, certain phrases ("jubilant remorse," "ancient practice") feel slightly overwrought. The metaphor of digital profiles as souls occasionally verges on the predictable. The story shows originality in its premise but sometimes relies on somewhat flowery language and stating emotional qualities rather than fully embodying them through specific, nuanced details. The tone remains consistent but occasionally reads as affected rather than authentic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole where they enhance rather than constrain the narrative. The premise of preserving digital legacies feels both timely and timeless. The writing style effectively balances lyrical and straightforward prose, though occasionally errs toward the ornate. The story leaves readers with thought-provoking questions about legacy, memory, and whose stories deserve preservation—demonstrating substance beyond its fantastical premise.</comment>
