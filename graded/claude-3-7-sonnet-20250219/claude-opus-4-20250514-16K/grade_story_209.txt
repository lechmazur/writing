<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The woodsman's character is thoughtfully developed through his complex relationship with his daughter and his work. His motivation to map electromagnetic fields is clear, and the dual life he leads reveals internal conflict. His distinct voice—particularly in his confessional moments—shows emotional depth. The transition from deception to revelation demonstrates growth, though his backstory could be more efficiently established.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects the opening (daughter's death) to the revelation (her consciousness in the network). The short-circuit action effectively drives the climactic moment. Despite the word constraint, the story achieves a complete arc from loss to transcendent reconnection. The cause-effect relationships are logically consistent within the established supernatural framework, with excellent pacing that builds to the emotional revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is brilliantly realized—both concrete and metaphysical. The atmosphere of electromagnetic liminality perfectly mirrors the character's emotional state and the story's themes about connection beyond death. Sensory details (ladder rungs "singing with electromagnetic interference") create immersive physicality despite the abstract concept. The setting isn't merely backdrop but becomes integral to the narrative's emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves profound emotional impact through its exploration of grief, connection, and the unexpected ways we know each other. The metaphor of electromagnetic fields as conduits for consciousness is masterfully handled. The ending delivers a satisfying revelation that recontextualizes the entire narrative. The theme of connection across seemingly impassable boundaries is subtly woven throughout, reinforced by imagery that effectively shows rather than tells emotional states.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story displays remarkable originality in its concept of electromagnetic railways as spectral pathways. Language remains purposeful throughout, with fresh metaphors ("gardens of pure signal") and nuanced emotion. The narrative maintains consistent tone while building toward its revelation. The daughter's secret parallel work adds genuine surprise without feeling contrived. Sensory details are specific rather than generic, with technical language that feels authentic to the character's expertise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves exceptional cohesion despite incorporating numerous assigned elements. The required elements feel essential rather than forced. The style balances technical precision with emotional resonance, creating depth while maintaining clarity. The brevity feels deliberate, with each sentence carrying necessary weight. The story's lingering emotional impact and its suggestion of consciousness beyond death demonstrate remarkable depth within tight constraints.</comment>
