<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's character is admirably developed through her dry wit that "barely masks decades of disappointment," creating immediate depth. Her connection to the Tarantella through her grandmother provides meaningful backstory. Her decisive action at the end shows growth. However, some of her motivations feel slightly underdevelopedâ€”we understand her duty but not entirely why she's personally invested beyond family tradition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot moves with exceptional coherence from the crossing off of the final name to the sentinel taking up the keeper's mantle. The frayed rope as both literal object and metaphorical representation of broken vows creates a powerful through-line. The revelation of the secret society and the corrupted ritual provides meaningful stakes. The resolution feels earned rather than contrived, with the sentinel's dance effectively closing the narrative circle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully rendered with "salt-stained windows" and shadows that respond to presence. The timeframe of finality (after crossing off the last name) creates perfect tension. The spectral dancers frozen "between ecstasy and horror" evoke genuine unease. The atmosphere of forgotten duty and supernatural consequence permeates every description, making the setting not just a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story skillfully uses the dance as both literal action and metaphor for binding promises, creating layered meaning. The rope that "writhed in moonlight" and "began to mend" during the dance shows impressive imagery. The final line about promises "worth keeping, even if they kill you" delivers thematic resonance that lingers. The ghost tableau creates visual impact while serving the plot. The story effectively shows the sentinel's determination rather than merely telling us about it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids AI-typical problems like generic descriptions or overused phrases. The Tarantella dance is incorporated with specific cultural context rather than vague generalities. The concepts of binding rituals and lighthouse keeping responsibilities feel organic rather than formulaic. Occasional phrases like "calculated spontaneity" and "reckless precision" show creative linguistic tension. While the ghost keeper twist isn't entirely original, its execution through dance and rope symbolism offers fresh perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story impressively weaves all required elements into a cohesive supernatural tale where each component enhances rather than distracts. The brevity works as strength, with enough detail to immerse but enough mystery to intrigue. The dance as binding ritual, the rope as physical manifestation of promises, and the lighthouse as symbol of guidance all contribute to thematic resonance about duty and tradition. The story lingers after reading, suggesting depths beyond its word count.</comment>
