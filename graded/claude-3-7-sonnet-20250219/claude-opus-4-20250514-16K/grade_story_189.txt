<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's character is distinctly shaped by her literal mindset, which effectively serves her quest to decode star maps. Her "brazenly calm" demeanor when facing ghosts reveals her pragmatic nature. However, we lack deeper insight into her personal stakes or emotional journey beyond her methodical approach. The character functions well for the plot but remains somewhat instrumental rather than fully dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves smoothly from discovery to revelation, with the overcharging action driving the climactic revelation of interstellar migration routes. The plot combines technological ingenuity with cosmic mystery in a coherent framework. Despite the brevity, the story achieves completeness with a clear beginning (discovery), middle (decoding process), and resolution (revelation of star maps' purpose). The plot feels neither rushed nor incomplete within its constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic lighthouse basement creates a liminal space between earth and cosmos, perfectly suited for astronomical revelation. The phosphorescent algae and electromagnetic ghosts build an ethereal atmosphere that enhances the cosmic mystery. The setting brilliantly connects earth's desperate water shortage with the possibility of cosmic escape, creating tension between terrestrial decay and celestial possibility. Sensory details like glowing walls and humming power create vivid immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story's theme of hope amidst ecological collapse resonates powerfully. The contrast between Earth's desperate present and potential cosmic futures creates emotional depth beyond the surface narrative. The metaphor of star navigation as both literal path-finding and metaphorical guidance for humanity's future adds thematic richness. While the ending effectively delivers on the premise, it slightly veers toward telling rather than showing in its final reflection on "hope written in starlight."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI pitfalls, demonstrating fresh metaphors and consistent worldbuilding. The concept of using a phone booth key to activate ancient technology feels genuinely inventive, and the integration of ghosts as "electromagnetic echoes" shows creative subversion of supernatural tropes. However, some phrasing becomes slightly overwrought ("the grandest design of all: hope written in starlight"), and certain emotional beats are more stated than demonstrated, particularly in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole, with each assigned component meaningfully contributing to the narrative. The post-apocalyptic setting, cosmic wayfinding, and technological remnants of the past create a rich tapestry that supports the central theme of finding escape routes through cosmic knowledge. While occasionally veering toward expository language, the story's brevity feels purposeful rather than constraining, and it leaves readers with the lingering question of humanity's cosmic potential.</comment>
