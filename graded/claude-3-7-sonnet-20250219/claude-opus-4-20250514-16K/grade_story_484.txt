<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus has a distinct voice and personality that emerges through his attitude toward gentrification and supernatural events. His motivation to stand against darkness-as-gentrification works metaphorically, but his transformation from passive protester to hero feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped given the word constraints. His "uniquely generic" quality is cleverly introduced but could be more thoroughly integrated into his character development.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the mirror shard discovery to create tension and drive the narrative forward. The structure follows a clear arc from protest to supernatural confrontation to resolution. The metaphorical connection between literal darkness and gentrification is clever, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The initiation of the investigation through the staircase discoloration creates a compelling entrance to the supernatural element.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard provides a rich backdrop that brilliantly merges the supernatural with contemporary social issues. The setting's transformation from protest site to supernatural battleground is handled with atmospheric precision. Sensory details effectively establish mood through the groaning staircase, writhing shadows, and moonlight reflection. The timeframe of the protest lull creates an effective transitional moment for discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story succeeds in creating a resonant metaphor where literal darkness represents gentrification, offering meaningful social commentary. The mirror as reflection of truth provides thematic depth. The defiant laughter as weapon against darkness is particularly effective. While the narrative relies on telling rather than showing in places, the central conflict between community preservation and erasure emerges clearly. The final line effectively crystallizes the theme of ordinary people reflecting extraordinary light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its metaphorical treatment of gentrification as supernatural darkness. The voice maintains consistency and the protagonist's flippant solemnity feels authentic rather than forced. However, phrases like "the kind of flippant solemnity one adopts" and "laughed, because what else does one do" read as somewhat formulaic observations. The resolution through collective laughter borders on predictable, and some metaphors (darkness as "bad Yelp review") feel too on-the-nose for literary fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with social commentary. The metaphorical treatment of darkness as gentrification demonstrates creative thinking, and the mirror shard provides an effective symbolic anchor. While some transitions feel rushed due to word constraints, the narrative maintains momentum. The story leaves readers with thought-provoking connections between supernatural horror and real-world issues, though some nuance is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
