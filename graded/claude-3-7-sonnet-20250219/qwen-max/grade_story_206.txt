<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's character has a clear motivation (finding the hidden continent) and her candy sculpting as rebellion shows creativity. However, her emotional development feels rushed, particularly her immediate shift from anonymous acts to active investigation. The revelation about her parents lacks sufficient emotional weight, and her "ardent scorn" attribute isn't consistently demonstrated throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from discovery to revelation, but the transition from candy sculptor to rebellion investigator feels abrupt. The locket's appearance is too convenient, and the resolution comes too easily with the elderly woman simply waiting for her. The connection between candy sculptures and the rebellion's information network is underdeveloped, leaving the "counterattack" mentioned in the final paragraph feeling tacked on.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten market as a setting for rebellion works effectively, with hints of decay (crumbling clock tower, dry fountain) reinforcing the oppressive atmosphere. The market's labyrinthine streets create tension during Liora's search. However, the "hidden continent" concept remains too abstract, and sensory details beyond visual elements are largely absent, limiting full immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the candy sculptures as metaphors for rebellion, and the photographs create a compelling mystery. However, the emotional impact is diluted by rushed revelations and telling rather than showing Liora's reactions. The theme of reclaiming lost history has potential but isn't fully developed. The ending feels hasty, with the "counterattack" mentioned but not shown, leaving the resolution incomplete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on several convenient coincidences (finding the locket, immediate response to photographs, elderly woman waiting) that feel formulaic. Phrases like "her heart pounding" are generic emotional indicators. The rebellion setting is somewhat clich√©d, and the hidden continent concept lacks originality. The story follows a predictable pattern of discovery-quest-revelation without subverting expectations or adding unique elements to distinguish it from similar narratives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements reasonably well, particularly the candy sculptor character and the forgotten market setting. However, it struggles with pacing, rushing through emotional beats and the final revelation. The concept of using candy sculptures as rebellion symbols is intriguing but underdeveloped. While the narrative has a complete arc, it lacks the depth and nuance needed for truly compelling literary fiction, relying too heavily on convenient plot developments rather than earned emotional resonance.</comment>
