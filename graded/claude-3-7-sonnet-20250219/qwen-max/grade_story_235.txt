<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aiko is established as a herbalist with a mystical connection to nature, but her deeper motivations remain somewhat underdeveloped. Her connection to the pressed flower book and meteor-reading abilities create intrigue, but we lack insight into her emotional landscape beyond surface-level determination. The final emotional shift feels slightly unearned without more character foundation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from garden to tower, with the repositioning driving meaningful progression. The meteor-reading method creates a unique framework for the narrative. While the story achieves a sense of completion with Aiko's internal resolution, the connection between beginning and end could be strengthened, and the "him" mentioned at the end appears without prior context, creating a slight disconnect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of ancient castle and art school creates a compelling setting with rich atmospheric potential. Sensory details like moonlight on herbs, weathered stone walls, and the celestial displays effectively immerse the reader. The atmosphere of mystical anticipation builds naturally throughout, culminating in the tower scene where setting, action, and emotion converge powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses celestial imagery and botanical symbolism to explore themes of connection across distance. The metaphor of intertwined fates as threads in a tapestry provides satisfying closure. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by keeping the reader at arm's length from Aiko's inner world, and the sudden mention of "him" at the end introduces a relationship that needed earlier groundwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of communicating through meteor patterns is genuinely original, and the integration of herbalism with celestial interpretation creates a fresh magical system. However, phrases like "dramatically subtle" and "distant intimacy" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient explanation, and the prose occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them through specific sensory details or actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with mystical undertones. The pressed flower book and meteor-reading create a distinctive magical framework. While the prose is generally strong with evocative imagery, the emotional core remains slightly underdeveloped, and the ending introduces a relationship dimension that feels rushed rather than carefully seeded throughout.</comment>
