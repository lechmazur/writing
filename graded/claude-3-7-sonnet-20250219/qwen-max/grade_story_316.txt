<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Calla's timidity is well-established and consistent throughout, showing genuine character development as she moves from trembling hands to determined action. Her motivation to fulfill her brother's vision provides clear purpose. However, her internal struggle could be more deeply explored, and her transformation feels slightly rushed within the word constraint. The "seraphic" quality is mentioned but not fully developed in her characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from hesitation to action, with Calla's consultation of the scoreboard effectively driving her transformation. The connection between the typewriter ribbon, her promise, and the healing work creates coherence. However, the transition from arcade to temple feels somewhat abrupt, and the resolution comes quickly without fully exploring the challenges of her healing work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of industrial decline with classical revival creates a rich, evocative setting. The temple-turned-community-center and abandoned arcade are vividly rendered with specific sensory details (dust motes, ivy-wrapped columns, flickering lights). The atmosphere of faded glory and tentative renewal perfectly complements the theme of healing after loss, creating a world that feels both tangible and symbolically resonant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism throughoutâ€”the typewriter ribbon as connection to the past, stitching as healing, the scoreboard as guidance. The theme of mending "not just fabric but souls" provides meaningful depth. While the emotional impact is strong, the ending feels slightly rushed, and the story would benefit from more showing of Calla's impact on those she helps rather than simply stating she can "mend anything."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI pitfalls, certain phrases ("seraphic seamstress," "scattered harmony") feel somewhat ornate without sufficient grounding. The metaphors are generally fresh, but occasional lines like "healing required action" tell rather than show. The narrative maintains consistent tone, but some transitions between settings feel mechanical rather than organic. The core concept is handled with originality, though the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with emotional resonance. The typewriter ribbon and sewing metaphors work particularly well with the healing theme. While the prose occasionally veers toward the ornate, it generally serves the story's atmosphere. The brevity works in creating a snapshot of transformation, though it limits full character development. The lingering image of Calla stitching memories together provides a satisfying conclusion that extends beyond the page.</comment>
