<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Callan's character is well-developed through his relationship with guilt and the past. His woodsman background justifies his methodical approach to mapping forgotten places, while the hairbrush serves as an effective emotional tether. His motivation to map railways evolves meaningfully into a deeper spiritual journey of releasing trapped souls and himself. However, we could benefit from more specific details about what lies he told or truths he avoided to make his transformation more impactful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves effectively from physical exploration to spiritual revelation with the short-circuit serving as both literal event and metaphorical catalyst. The story achieves a complete arc within its constraints—beginning with Callan's arrival, building tension through his climb, and culminating in catharsis as he releases the echoes. The connection between mapping railways and freeing souls creates a satisfying thematic parallel. The pacing effectively balances description and action without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden creates an immediately evocative setting where the invisible becomes tangible. The atmosphere brilliantly merges technological and supernatural elements, with "static" and "invisible currents" creating a liminal space perfect for the story's themes. Sensory details are particularly strong—the damp earth, creaking ladder, resonant thrum—and the water tower serves as both physical landmark and metaphorical vessel for trapped stories. The "despairing cheer" tone manifests in the bittersweet release at the conclusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the water tower as both literal structure and metaphor for emotional containment. The transformation of mapping physical spaces to releasing emotional burdens creates a powerful subtext about confronting personal history. The ending delivers genuine catharsis as Callan's honesty frees both the trapped voices and himself. The imagery of echoes as "fragments of stories" and the hairbrush as a "key" demonstrates sophisticated symbolism. The central conflict between avoidance and confrontation resolves meaningfully through Callan's act of acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with its consistent tone and purposeful language. The metaphors feel fresh—particularly the echoes as "prisoners yearning for release" and the hospital monitor as a "ghostly metronome." However, some phrases like "the very ground resisted his intrusion" and "symphony of voices" lean toward familiar territory. The emotional progression feels authentic rather than stated, with Callan's transformation shown through action rather than exposition. The story demonstrates originality in how it transforms mapping physical spaces into mapping emotional terrain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive whole that feels intentional rather than constrained. The woodsman character, radio wave garden, and water tower create a distinctive atmosphere that supports the theme of honesty as liberation. The brevity works in the story's favor, creating a focused meditation on guilt and redemption. The lingering impression of Callan's unburdening suggests depth beyond the explicit narrative. While some connections could be strengthened, the overall effect is of a thoughtfully crafted piece with emotional resonance.</comment>
