<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liang's character shows promise with his "rationally impulsive" nature driving his mystery-solving, but this attribute isn't fully explored through concrete actions. His motivation to give "voice to those silenced by time" feels authentic, though his chameleon-like qualities as an actor are mentioned but not demonstrated beyond a brief reference at the end. The character has depth but lacks the nuanced development that would make him truly memorable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from mystery to resolution, with the cold-case investigation driving the narrative forward. The connection between the doll's dress clue and the ultimate discovery feels organic. However, the revelation that Mei simply ran away feels somewhat anticlimactic given the post-apocalyptic setting and theatrical framing. The pacing works well within the constraints, though the resolution comes rather quickly after the buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crumbling Chinese palace-theater creates a vivid, evocative setting that perfectly complements the story's themes of preservation and performance. The "anxious serenity" permeates the atmosphere through concrete details like "faded murals" and the jasmine scent. The post-oil world provides meaningful context without overwhelming the intimate mystery. Sensory details—particularly visual and olfactory—are deployed with precision to immerse the reader in this decaying yet beautiful space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the doll's dress as both literal clue and metaphorical connection to the past. The theme of art preserving human stories amid societal collapse resonates strongly. The ending, where Liang performs Mei's story, creates a satisfying thematic resolution about the power of performance to maintain human connection. However, the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by telling rather than showing Liang's emotional reactions, and the "ghosts" audience feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids the most obvious AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases ("anxious serenity," "rationally impulsive") feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient exploration. The narrative relies on some predictable elements—the hidden chamber, the convenient explanatory note. The emotional beats sometimes default to telling ("tears welled in Liang's eyes") rather than showing complex reactions. The post-apocalyptic theater setting shows originality, but the mystery's resolution follows a relatively conventional pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with thematic resonance about art, memory, and human resilience. The post-oil world setting and theatrical framing create an intriguing backdrop for the mystery. While the prose occasionally reaches for poetic effect at the expense of clarity, the overall execution demonstrates thoughtful craft. The story leaves readers with meaningful reflections on how performance preserves human stories even as civilization crumbles.</comment>
