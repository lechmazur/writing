<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The swordsman's character is well-established through the paradoxical "fiercely apathetic" attribute, creating an intriguing tension. His motivation—the hidden promise to overcome himself—provides depth, though it remains somewhat abstract. The obsidian shard and dying friend's advice add compelling backstory, but the character lacks a truly distinctive voice or specific emotional reactions that would elevate him beyond an archetypal weary warrior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the "following meteor showers" method to drive the narrative forward, culminating in the discovery of a specific destination. However, while there's a clear beginning and middle, the ending feels more like a setup than a resolution. The pacing works well within the word constraint, but the causal relationships between the monastery setting, the character's journey, and the meteors' significance could be more tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery creates an immediately compelling visual anchor, and its impossible suspension "among the clouds" perfectly complements the ethereal meteor showers. Sensory details like the "jagged edge" of the rock, the wind whipping around the swordsman, and the vibration syncing with his heartbeat create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The contrast between the solemn monastery and the dynamic celestial phenomena effectively enhances the story's mystical tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (meteors as both spiritual phenomena and practical guides) and creates tension between the monks' ritual perspective and the swordsman's pragmatic view. The ending creates genuine intrigue with the lingering meteor and distant peak. However, the central conflict remains somewhat nebulous, and while the theme of finding one's path amid spiritual and personal confusion is present, it could be developed with more specificity and emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, phrases like "fiercely apathetic glint" and "knowing naivety" feel somewhat contradictory without sufficient explanation. The narrative relies on familiar tropes (weary warrior, mystical monastery, dying friend's cryptic advice) without fully subverting them. Some descriptions like "celestial omens" and "sacred ritual" lean toward generic spiritual language. The obsidian shard and meteor-following concept show originality, but could benefit from more specific, unexpected details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with an intriguing premise. The floating monastery and meteor showers create a distinctive setting that supports both the literal and metaphorical journey. However, the brevity constrains full development of the character's internal conflict and the significance of his promise. While the ending creates forward momentum, the story feels more like an engaging opening chapter than a complete narrative, leaving too many questions unanswered for full satisfaction.</comment>
