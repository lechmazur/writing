<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The unseen observer has clear motivation to rescue ancient traditions, but their personality remains somewhat underdeveloped. The "aggressively kind determination" offers a glimpse of character, but lacks deeper exploration. Their reaction to the dancer's foot touching the stage shows sensitivity to distant events, suggesting depth, but their emotional landscape remains largely unexplored beyond their dedication to their task.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from the observer's preparation to the summoning and arrival of the spirits. The connection between the whistle, the call, and the emergence of the keepers creates logical cause-effect relationships. However, the "flinch" at the dancer's foot touching the stage, while creating an interesting synchronicity, isn't fully integrated into the main plot thread about restoring traditions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is exceptionally well-realized through sensory details like fogged windows, creaking floorboards, and crashing waves. The atmosphere of isolation, anticipation, and ancient power permeates the narrative. The juxtaposition of the mundane plastic whistle against the supernatural setting creates effective tension, while the coastal environment naturally connects to the sea-dwelling spirits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story effectively builds tension toward the summoning moment and creates a satisfying resolution with the arrival of the spirits. The imagery of seaweed-cloaked figures emerging from the surf is vivid and memorable. The theme of preserving tradition resonates throughout. However, the story relies more on telling than showing in places, particularly regarding the observer's emotional state, and some metaphors feel slightly generic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids major clich√©s, certain phrases like "the room seemed to hold its breath" and "the air thick with anticipation" feel somewhat formulaic. The narrative maintains consistent tone but occasionally slips into overly formal language. The concept of summoning sea spirits to preserve traditions shows originality, but the execution sometimes relies on expected supernatural tropes rather than surprising interpretations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative about preserving ancient traditions. The haunted lighthouse setting and supernatural elements create an effective atmosphere that supports the central theme. While the writing is generally strong, occasional reliance on telling rather than showing and some predictable phrasing prevent it from reaching the highest tier of literary excellence. The ending effectively establishes the beginning of a larger mission, leaving readers with a sense of continuation.</comment>
