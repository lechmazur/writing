<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's character is well-developed through his relationship with his father's legacy and his unusual stage fright. His motivation to overcome his father's deceptions is clear and consistent. The pressed wildflowers effectively serve as emotional anchors revealing his connection to Earth. However, his transformation from fearful to confident feels somewhat abrupt within the limited space, and his internal conflict could be more deeply explored to elevate the character beyond the solid foundation presented.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently from Kael's struggle with his inheritance to confrontation with the mechanical ghost, creating a satisfying arc. The exorcism action drives the narrative forward purposefully. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed—the ghost's defeat comes too easily after so much buildup about Kael's previous failures. The connection between the father's rituals and Kael's eventual success could be more explicitly developed to strengthen the plot's internal logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is exceptionally well-utilized, creating a powerful metaphor for Kael's emotional state while providing a unique backdrop for the exorcism. The juxtaposition of cosmic emptiness with toy assembly creates compelling tension. Sensory details like the "hum of distant collisions" and wildflowers that "smelled faintly of earth" effectively ground the ethereal setting. The mechanical ghost emerging from discarded technology fits perfectly within this environment, making the setting integral rather than incidental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the inheritance metaphor throughout, creating resonant subtext about legacy and truth. The final realization that "the inheritance of lies wasn't just his burden—it was also his weapon" delivers a satisfying thematic punch. Literary devices, particularly the contrast between cosmic vastness and intimate personal struggle, enhance the emotional impact. However, the conflict resolution lacks sufficient complexity—the ghost's defeat happens too quickly without enough resistance to fully satisfy the buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its space exorcist concept and the mechanical ghost born from technological debris. The writing avoids purple prose while maintaining evocative language. However, some metaphors like "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" feel slightly generic, and the ghost's dialogue ("why he dared disturb its eternal drift") leans toward familiar supernatural confrontation tropes. The emotional progression, while generally authentic, occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly in describing Kael's transformation from fearful to confident.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with a clear emotional arc. The orbital setting and exorcist character work particularly well together, creating a fresh premise. The brevity feels appropriate rather than limiting, allowing the story to deliver its central theme about transforming inherited burdens into strengths. While some elements could be more deeply integrated (particularly the toy assembly aspect), the overall execution demonstrates creative thinking and leaves readers with the lingering question of what other "doors" Kael might now be able to open.</comment>
