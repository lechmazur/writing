<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vigilant orchardist's character is well-developed through his punctuality, sardonic attitude, and motivation rooted in past trauma. His suspicion and methodical approach to uncovering the conspiracy align with his established traits. However, his emotional depth could be further explored, and his "voice" lacks some distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from suspicion to discovery to exposure, with the demonstration of truth via peacock tail patterns serving as an interesting method. The story achieves a complete arc within the constraints, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The connection between the antique seal and the facility's documents creates a satisfying plot device, but the peacock metaphor's integration is sometimes forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility provides a unique backdrop that effectively contrasts with the orchardist's natural background. Sensory details like "fluorescent lights" and the "glinting" seal create atmosphere. The connection between the corporate conspiracy and environmental destruction ties meaningfully to the protagonist's past. The peacocks at the end create symbolic closure, though more immersive sensory details throughout would strengthen the world-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (peacock tails, interlocking feathers) and creates tension through the gradual uncovering of the conspiracy. The ending provides satisfying closure with the public expos√©. However, the narrative occasionally tells rather than shows emotional states, and some metaphors feel slightly overworked. The theme of environmental justice versus corporate greed emerges clearly but could benefit from more nuanced exploration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-typical pitfalls but contains some overly formal phrasing and occasionally relies on telling rather than showing emotions ("A thrill of vindication coursed through him"). The peacock tail metaphor, while creative, is applied somewhat mechanically. The narrative maintains consistent tone and the character's motivation feels authentic, though some descriptions like "sardonic glee" are repeated rather than demonstrated through varied actions or dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative with environmental themes that resonate beyond the text. The vigilant orchardist's background provides meaningful context for his actions, and the antique seal creates an effective plot device. While the peacock pattern method feels somewhat forced, the overall narrative maintains momentum and creates a satisfying arc within the constraints. The ending effectively ties together the personal and political dimensions of the story.</comment>
