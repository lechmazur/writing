<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted effectively in the concept of a "legacy's burden." Her change from feeling this as a weight to embracing it as a purpose is earned. However, the internal conflict feels slightly muted; while "her fingers trembling" offers a moment of embodiment, her interiority during the climax favors summary ("She understood then") over experiencing the contradictory impulses of revelation and fear simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal drive. Each discovery—the diaries, the true nature of the film strip—logically and inevitably propels the protagonist to the next action, culminating in the hidden chamber. The closure is a clean and resonant Conceptual Repricing, as the story's central question is re-framed with a palpable shift in the protagonist's purpose. The cost is felt in her acceptance of a new, lifelong responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is superb, functioning as an active force rather than a backdrop. Details like the "ivy-veiled passage" and the "fireplace, half-buried in rubble" are not just descriptive but are integral tools that directly constrain and enable the plot's progression. The environment directly charges the final, resonant image of the "window," making the setting indispensable to the story's thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling her legacy—is established immediately and effectively tested. The discovery of the diaries and the scholar's warning ("To listen is to lose oneself") provides a single, sharp escalation, raising the personal cost of her quest. The final choice to accept her role as the walls' "voice" is a decisive stance crystallization driven by her actions, with the cost being the transformation of a generational burden into a personal, unending duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory and the importance of being remembered emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids direct moralizing, instead offering a powerful, non-literal answer to its central question in the final scene. The final image of the window and the transformation of "burden" to "purpose" provides a resonant thematic closure that lingers without needing to be explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances evocative description with the protagonist’s internal focus. The voice is distinct and literary from the first sentence, establishing a tone of thoughtful inquiry and ancient mystery. The narrative prose possesses a clear perceptual signature, filtering the strange environment through the specific lens of a "Corridor Echo Cartographer."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the passage. However, momentum is slightly dulled at key moments by a shift towards telling ("She understood then") and the use of a stock phrase ("Her heart raced"). While the overall craft is strong, these minor instances of summary over dramatization in the climactic beats prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a "Corridor Echo Cartographer" seeking what walls dream about is wonderfully fresh and imaginative. It synthesizes tropes of psychometry and exploration into a unique, personal quest. The resolution feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable, transforming a fantastical concept into a poignant reflection on memory and legacy. The story's specific details elevate it far beyond a generic template.</comment>
