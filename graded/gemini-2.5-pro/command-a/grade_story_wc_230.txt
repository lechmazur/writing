<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation for psychological safety is clear and consistent, providing a strong anchor. The internal conflict between his rational mind and the supernatural reality he confronts is well-drawn. However, his final realization is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity ("psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths..."), which reads less like an earned, embodied shift and more like a tidy thematic summary, slightly flattening the character's arc at the close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot progresses logically from inciting incident to resolution without any breaks in causality. The closure, a Decisive Change combined with a Conceptual Repricing, is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost—the renunciation of the relic and the burden of a new understanding. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "hanging orchard" is more than just a backdrop; it's an active participant. Its "fractured grace" mirrors the story's central theme and Elias's internal state. The setting both provides the inciting incident and serves as the necessary stage for the resolution, with the "first sunbeam" being a key constraint in the climax. This integration of environment into the causal chain is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's control over his own mind and psychological safety—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure. The conflict forces the rational protagonist to embrace a superstitious solution, a strong character-driven turn. The resolution is earned directly through his agency in performing the ritual, and the cost of his new wisdom is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of truth and safety is woven effectively through the plot, but the ending succumbs to overt moralizing. The line "psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry" is a direct thematic statement that replaces resonance with explanation. This "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph significantly undermines the subtextual work done earlier, making the conclusion feel less profound than it could have been.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elias’s rational, deliberate character. Psychic distance is managed well, particularly in the moment he first experiences the curse. Mara's dialogue is distinct and serves its purpose efficiently. The prose signature is controlled and effective throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences like "The hanging orchard in the ravine was a place of fractured grace" establish tone and setting with impressive economy. There is a slight shift towards summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs ("The relic was gone, but its lesson remained..."), which dulls the immediacy of the otherwise strong line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While the "cursed object" is a familiar trope, its application within a post-empathy virus world focused on "psychological safety" provides a fresh and compelling angle. The synthesis of a rationalist protagonist with a folkloric problem is executed with conviction. The story doesn't invent a new genre but thoughtfully transforms existing elements into a coherent and resonant whole.</comment>
