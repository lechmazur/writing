<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking his professional methodicalness to his supernatural gift. His interiority is concrete, though phrases like "weightless burden... both a curse and a calling" veer close to thematic summary rather than embodied contradiction. The character's actions are well-aligned with his established traits, making his progression through the scene feel earned and logical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically prompting the next action. The structure is a tight, single continuous scene, perfectly suited for the length. The closure, a Decisive Change where the clock is fixed and ghosts appeased, lands effectively, and the final line provides the necessary conceptual cost by reframing his "closure" as merely a temporary pause in an ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and functional, creating a palpable atmosphere of decayed joy and lingering presence. Sensory details like the "scent of sawdust and popcorn" and the "dim, eerie calm" are employed with purpose. Crucially, the ceiling is not just backdrop but an active part of the environment that constrains the central choice and contains the resolution, elevating the setting's role beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—appeasing the restless spirits—and escalates the pressure coherently. Marcus's agency drives the plot from investigation to decisive action. The climax resolves the immediate conflict, and the cost, while not physical, is made legible in the final sentence, confirming his burden is cyclical and inescapable. This final beat provides the necessary weight to an otherwise straightforward resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of healing forgotten places and accepting a difficult calling emerge organically from the plot. The "cracks in the façade" functions as a central motif that is satisfyingly resolved and then re-contextualized in the final line. However, the story occasionally resorts to direct thematic statements ("It was a weightless burden, this gift of his") which slightly undermines the subtextual strength of its imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the protagonist's observant and methodical nature. Psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting appropriately as Marcus moves from detached analysis to trembling action. The prose signature is distinct and controlled, effectively reflecting the character’s focused but sensitive inner world without leakage or inconsistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates good momentum, with varied sentence structure and precise word choice. The story avoids overwriting, maintaining a focused, uncluttered feel. There are minor instances of summary over scene, such as describing the ghosts' reaction as a "chorus of relief and gratitude," which could have been rendered with a more specific, resonant image to strengthen the emotional impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While the "psychic helper" trope is familiar, the story achieves originality through its specific synthesis of disparate elements: an elevator technician, a circus, and horology. The premise feels fresh due to these unique details and the grounded, procedural way the character approaches the supernatural. The execution is highly competent, though the narrative arc itself follows a recognizable pattern rather than subverting it.</comment>
