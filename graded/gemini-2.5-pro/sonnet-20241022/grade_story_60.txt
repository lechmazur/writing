<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's "indifference" is stated but feels underdeveloped or slightly contradicted by the clear purpose and generational weight driving her actions; it primarily manifests as familiarity with the dead rather than a pervasive trait influencing her core approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and effective for the word count, utilizing the "between bells" timeframe for excellent pacing and tension; the arc from descent to revelation is clear and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strongly realized through the combination of the catacomb setting, midnight timeframe, and sensory details like the "uniquely natural" stone, effectively supporting the mystical tone and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through effective symbolism (keys, ribbon), a satisfying thematic resolution (understanding vs. control), and subtext regarding the nature of the covenant; the ending feels purposeful.</comment>
