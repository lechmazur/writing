<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character feels thin; 'meek necromancer' traits are stated but not deeply explored or demonstrated through distinctive action or voice. The necromancy aspect feels superficial until the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but the central revelation via dewdrop feels somewhat convenient and lacks strong originality. Pacing is adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is consistent, and setting elements (goblins, tapestry, crystals) are present, but sensory details lack exceptional vividness. Goblin acceptance of a necromancer relies on a slightly underdeveloped 'ancient wisdom' trope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic clarity (experience over intellect) and uses symbolism effectively, but the theme itself is common, and the emotional impact is mild rather than profound. Conflict resolution feels neat but lacks deep resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on familiar fantasy tropes (wise ancient race, universal riddle, tapestry of fate, simple truth revealed) without significant subversion. Some phrasing feels generic. Lacks a distinctive voice or truly original perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements competently but feels more like a well-executed exercise than an inspired piece of fiction. It fulfills requirements but lacks the spark, depth, and originality required for top-tier publication.</comment>
