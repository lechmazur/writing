<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'uncommonly typical' attribute feels slightly told rather than purely shown, relying on the description itself. However, the motivation (letting the tale be told) derived from the future self's message via the coil is clear and drives her internal conflict and decision effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure (setup, internal conflict, decision) is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit. The past 'contamination' via the 'echo' effectively establishes the stakes for the present moment before the test. Pacing is well-managed for a contemplative piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting (capsule hotel) and timeframe (before a test) work synergistically to amplify the character's isolation and the weight of her secret knowledge. The atmosphere is well-established through details like dim light and soft hums, strongly supporting the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Craft is strong, employing effective metaphors ('caged bird', 'seed') and symbolism (the coil). The central conflict is internal but palpable, and a clear theme regarding truth versus established doctrine emerges. The ending provides a satisfying sense of quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids glaring signs of artificiality or excessive clich√©s, though elements like 'shatter the very foundations' are familiar. While not radically original, the specific combination of temporal paradox, love story, and institutional critique feels authentic and thoughtfully executed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative successfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The brief format feels appropriate for the focused internal moment depicted. It leaves the reader with a lingering sense of quiet rebellion and the potential power of hidden truths.</comment>
