<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and potent (grief, obsession), driving the narrative. The connection to the object (hairbrush) is strong. However, the 'seasoned woodsman' attribute feels underdeveloped and somewhat disconnected from the core activities involving radio waves and technology, weakening the overall character coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, linking the initial motivation to the final discovery. The method (measuring echo) is integral. However, the pacing feels compressed at the climax, rushing the convergence of the mother's death and the railway discovery. The 'freed by honesty' element feels slightly convenient as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The 'radio wave garden' setting is highly original, atmospheric, and effectively integrated with the technological method and the story's themes of memory and echoes. Sensory details (humming, static, metal flowers) create strong immersion. The atmosphere strongly supports the character's motivation and the 'despairing cheer' tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of evocative imagery ("metal flowers," "electromagnetic lullaby") and symbolism (hairbrush, radio waves). The story achieves significant emotional impact and thematic depth (memory, loss, resolution) despite its brevity. The central conflict is clear and the ending, while abrupt, is purposeful and resonant. Shows more than tells effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept and its execution feel original, particularly the blend of technology, nature imagery, and grief. Metaphors are generally fresh. While it avoids overt AI tells or clich√©s, some phrasing ("artfully messy," "peculiar mix") feels slightly constructed. The emotional arc feels authentic, avoiding simplistic statements of feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high creativity in combining disparate elements into a largely cohesive and emotionally resonant whole. The unique setting and method are memorable. While most elements serve the story well, the 'woodsman' aspect feels less vital. The ending feels slightly rushed but ultimately impactful, leaving a lingering sense of bittersweet resolution.</comment>
