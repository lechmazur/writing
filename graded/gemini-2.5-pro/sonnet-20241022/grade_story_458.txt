<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving tradition) is clear but standard; the assigned 'spiritually secular' attribute is stated but not convincingly embodied or explored in action or internal conflict. The character feels more like a vessel for the theme than a complex individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a simple arc (delivery -> choice -> resolution) within the word count, but the resolution feels abrupt and overly simplistic given the potentially world-altering stakes ("obliterate") introduced. The connection between coffee reading and the final choice is functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of sci-fi (Library Ship, spaceport) and mysticism (coffee reading) is interesting conceptually but executed superficially. The abandoned spaceport setting adds some mood, but the 'Library Ship' feels like window dressing. The 'fractal sorrow' tone is asserted rather than consistently evoked through nuanced description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (button, fractals) is present but heavy-handed. The story relies more on telling emotions ("weight pressed," "saw...sorrow") than showing. The theme of tradition vs. progress is clear but handled predictably, and the ending lacks resonance due to its simplicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept mix (space librarian, coffee prophecy) offers originality, the execution leans on familiar tropes (wise elder mystic, last keeper of tradition). The prose is competent but lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh metaphors; emotional nuance is stated rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story incorporates the assigned elements, but their integration often feels functional rather than seamless or inspired. The brevity suits the simple arc, but the narrative doesn't achieve significant depth or leave a lasting impression beyond fulfilling the prompt's requirements.</comment>
