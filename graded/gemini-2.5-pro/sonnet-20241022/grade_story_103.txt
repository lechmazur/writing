<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character arc relies heavily on exposition and stated emotions ("strangely at peace," "joyful resignation") rather than earned development through action or nuanced internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot is largely internal reflection; the resolution hinges on a symbolic act rather than significant external plot progression, feeling static despite the internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively established with conventional imagery (lighthouse, sea), but lacks truly distinctive sensory details or world-building to elevate it beyond competence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror, items, pattern) is functional but somewhat overt; the central theme is clear but lacks subtle layering or subtext expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The premise is mildly interesting but relies on familiar tropes (noble sacrifice, magical mirror); language uses some slightly ornate phrasing ("exquisite torture") without achieving true originality or freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated serviceably, but the story feels somewhat like a well-executed prompt response rather than an organically conceived narrative with a unique voice or vision.</comment>
