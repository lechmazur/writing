<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miranda's core motivation (decoding art) and intellectual spontaneity are demonstrated, but the 'ruthless florist' trait feels superficial and disconnected from the main narrative events. The comb is integrated well as a character object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from inciting incident (text) to climax (decoding). The 'distinguish' action during the drive serves character development more than plot propulsion. Achieves a reasonable arc within the word count, though the initial setup feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is vividly realised, especially with the bioluminescence. The 'pause between verses' timeframe adds significant atmospheric resonance, effectively linking sound and sight. The contrast between the mundane and mystical enhances the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique blend of the mundane (floristry) and the mystical (archaeology), creating memorable imagery (weeping stones, comb tracing). The central conflict (decoding the sudden phenomenon) is clear and resolved. The theme of finding order/meaning in unexpected places is evident.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is original, avoiding common tropes. The prose is competent and generally avoids clich√© or overly robotic phrasing. However, the character's internal logic feels slightly convenient rather than deeply nuanced, and the overall style lacks a truly distinctive, high-literary voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, albeit quirky, narrative. The disparate elements largely serve the story, particularly the comb and the setting. The brevity feels appropriate for the focused event described, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
