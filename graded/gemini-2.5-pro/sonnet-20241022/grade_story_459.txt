<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The character concept is clear, but the assigned attribute "elegantly clumsy" is merely stated via another character's perception and not demonstrated, feeling tacked-on. Motivation is functional but explained rather than deeply inhabited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a mini-arc, but the plot feels thin, relying heavily on the final symbolic gesture. The assigned method (ghost tours) is background exposition, not integrated into this scene's driving action or structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The unique setting (Sand Castle Lab) and its inherent contrast with the ghosts create a strong atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details (whispers, hum). However, the timeframe element ("amid lunch breaks") feels weakly connected to the main action presented.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance and uses symbolism effectively (flower crown), but the final dialogue is too didactic, explicitly stating the theme ("complex truths... simplest gestures") rather than allowing the action to convey it with more subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise possesses originality (ghosts/sand lab), avoiding egregious clich√©s. However, the narrative resolution feels somewhat predictable ('helping ghosts let go'), and the prose, while competent, lacks a truly distinctive voice or innovative flair demanded at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While managing a degree of cohesion, the integration of all assigned elements isn't seamless; the attribute and method feel particularly extraneous to the core scene. The story serves the premise well but doesn't transcend it into truly exceptional territory.</comment>
