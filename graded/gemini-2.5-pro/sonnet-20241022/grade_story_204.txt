<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Maya's shift from shame to validated acceptance occurs too rapidly within the encounter, feeling more told than shown. The vendor acts primarily as a thematic mouthpiece, lacking significant independent depth beyond facilitating Maya's realization. Motivation is stated but not explored with nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc (encounter leading to realization) within the word limit, driven effectively by the chance encounter. However, the thematic connection between the ticket punch and cuddling, while present, feels somewhat convenient and the resolution slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is evocative and creates a strong atmospheric contrast between technological remnants and enduring human connection. The timeframe adds subtle tension. However, the integration of the 'unusually usual' attribute feels superficial and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the ticket punch as a central symbol and establishes a clear theme about the continuity of care. However, the dialogue, particularly the vendor's, borders on expository, lessening the impact of the emotional discovery. The ending feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The writing avoids obvious AI pitfalls and clich√©s. However, the neatness of the thematic resolution and the slightly overly articulate exposition from the vendor lack the messiness and subtlety often found in truly distinctive human writing. Emotional states are somewhat explicitly declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated reasonably well, serving the central theme. The story feels cohesive for its length. However, the 'unusually usual' attribute is poorly integrated, and the overall execution feels slightly formulaic in its thematic delivery, preventing it from reaching top-tier distinction.</comment>
