<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a preservationist rebel is clear and drives the plot, but her characterization feels somewhat archetypal. The ghost's development relies heavily on visual description ("translucent," "shifting") rather than deeper revealed personality, limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit. The central action (theorizing) effectively leads to the climax, but the swiftness of the alliance formation feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the haunted passage between storms is effectively rendered using sensory details (damp stone, cold spot, thunder). The setting strongly supports the narrative and theme, though some descriptions lean towards familiar haunted house tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully establishes a central conflict and theme (preservation against destruction). The unique partnership provides some impact, but the execution lacks significant subtext or profound emotional resonance beyond the stated connection. The ending provides closure but feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of a preservationist ghost is interesting but not entirely novel. The writing avoids obvious AI tells but lacks a truly distinctive voice or style. The "constantly changing" sticky note feels like a slightly contrived plot device rather than an organic element.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates the assigned elements cohesively, serving the central theme of preservation. However, it doesn't quite transcend the feeling of being constructed around these elements to achieve a sense of organic inevitability or exceptional artistic merit required for top-tier publication.</comment>
