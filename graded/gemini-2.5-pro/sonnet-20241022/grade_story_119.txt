<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation feels inconsistent; the shift from hiding her ability "even from herself" to suddenly deciding to share it lacks sufficient grounding. The "survivalist" background feels superficially applied to justify the teaching element rather than being deeply woven into her persona. The assigned attribute "sometimes always" is grammatically awkward and its integration ("sometimes always kept this ability hidden") is nonsensical and detracts significantly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (revelation, action, resolution) within the word limit, and the action drives the narrative. However, the connection between Maya's established survival skills and her method of spiritual guidance feels tenuous. The pacing is adequate, but the core coherence relies on accepting a somewhat abrupt thematic leap from physical to spiritual survival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is effectively used, providing strong atmosphere and a functional mechanism (shadows on tracks) for the plot. The mood supports the ghostly encounter. However, the specified timeframe ("in the seconds following a sudden revelation") is poorly represented; the action clearly unfolds over a longer period *after* the revelation, not immediately within seconds of it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (key, shadows) and explores a theme of transcendence. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by slightly clich√©d descriptions ("dissolving into peaceful light") and stated emotions ("unyielding compassion"). The central conflict is clear and resolved neatly, perhaps too neatly for profound impact. Showing versus telling could be stronger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (ghost trapped at accident site, wise grandmother figure, magical key) without significant subversion. Phrases like "hit her like a thunderbolt" and "rising like morning mist" feel generic. The awkward insertion of "sometimes always" and the slightly forced connection between survivalism and spiritualism hint at formulaic element combination rather than organic originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story makes a valiant effort to integrate disparate elements, but the seams are visible, particularly with the awkward attribute ("sometimes always") and the reinterpretation of the motivation ("preserve survival skills"). While the setting and core action work well, the conceptual links feel forced, preventing the story from feeling entirely cohesive or achieving a sense of inevitable rightness.</comment>
