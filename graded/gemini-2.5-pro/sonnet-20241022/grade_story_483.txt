<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The transformation from world-weary sheriff to monk-aspirant feels narratively convenient rather than deeply earned psychological progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional arc, but hinges on a somewhat clich√©d catalyst (encounter with serene monks) lacking significant narrative tension or complexity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competently establishes mood, but the settings (meditation room, road trips) lack truly distinctive or evocative rendering beyond the surface level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear theme and symbolism (lava lamp, card), but the execution lacks subtlety and fails to evoke profound emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the familiar "burnout seeking enlightenment" trope without offering significant subversion or a unique authorial voice; language is functional but uninspired.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are present but feel somewhat assembled rather than organically fused; the story doesn't rise above a competent but predictable execution.</comment>
