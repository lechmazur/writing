<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'amiable' trait is minimally demonstrated; the 'doubly singular' attribute feels asserted rather than organically woven into nuanced actions or voice. Motivation is clear but standard for a researcher; deeper internal conflict or complexity is lacking for this tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with a clear arc, but relies heavily on the convenient coincidence of the crossword pattern matching the resonance frequency. The resolution feels somewhat neat and predictable, lacking a truly surprising or challenging turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively established and sensory details are present (humming, crackling). The setting enhances the concept, but the 'haunted' aspect feels underutilized, relying more on implication than evocative detail required for top-tier work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story presents an interesting concept (quantum folklore) and uses symbolism (lighthouse beam, crossword). However, the impact remains primarily intellectual; the final thematic statement about 'spaces in between' feels slightly didactic rather than emerging purely from the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core premise offers originality, but the execution contains familiar beats (grant approval triggers breakthrough, convenient pattern match). While avoiding overt clich√©s, it lacks a highly distinctive voice or truly fresh narrative structure, feeling competent but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are integrated serviceably, and the story achieves coherence within its constraints. However, it doesn't fully transcend its construction; it feels like a well-executed response to requirements rather than a story demanding publication based on sheer artistic necessity or brilliance.</comment>
