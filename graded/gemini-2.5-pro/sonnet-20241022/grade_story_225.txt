<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's actions align with "apothecary," but the "wayward" aspect feels superficial. Motivation (tracking Elena via butterflies) is clear but relies heavily on stated past events (betrayal, stolen research) rather than deeply explored character flaws or complexities. The "unjustly fair" attribute offers a glimpse of nuance but isn't fully woven into her present actions or decisions beyond a single reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc (tracking -> communication -> revelation -> pursuit) is coherent within the word limit. The core action (infecting butterflies) drives the narrative, and the method (morse code) facilitates interaction. However, the rival's convenient modification of the infection into a symbiotic bond feels slightly contrived, serving plot resolution too neatly. Pacing is adequate, but the transition from tracking tool to symbiotic bond requires more narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting and "between broken treaties" timeframe create a strong, specific atmosphere. Sensory details (brass, steam, murky depths, bioluminescence) are present and generally effective. The "battered marvel" tone is established but could be more consistently integrated into the descriptions and Mira's internal voice. The setting enhances the isolation and the unconventional nature of the communication.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance through the central metaphor of the modified butterflies representing adapted love/communication. Symbolism (bioluminescence, rust on brass) is employed effectively. The central conflict (reconciliation vs. betrayal) is clear. However, some phrasing ("love letter written in biochemistry") borders on overly sentimental for the highest literary standard. The theme of adapting communication is clear but could benefit from subtler execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The combination of steampunk, biochemistry, and underwater migration offers originality. However, the core romance trope (betrayed lovers, rival scientists) is familiar. While avoiding overtly machine-like prose, some descriptions lack truly fresh, specific sensory detail. The emotional handling ("unjustly fair") shows promise but doesn't reach profound nuance. The plot resolution feels somewhat predictable once the modification is revealed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, integrating most elements effectively into a unique scenario. The core concept and setting work well together. However, certain elements (like the dry highlighter pen) feel less integral than others, suggesting the constraints occasionally dictated the narrative rather than seamlessly serving it. The brief length works for a snapshot, leaving a lingering sense of melancholic hope.</comment>
