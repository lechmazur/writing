<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("like father") is clear but thin; the "notorious" aspect is asserted but unsupported by actions or context. The method of control (movies) feels somewhat contrived as a character trait rather than deeply rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a simple arc within the word count, driven by the assigned action/method. However, it lacks significant tension or stakes, feeling more like a descriptive vignette than a compelling narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are effectively established, using the crystalline caves and futuristic nostalgia tone well. Sensory details are present, though could be more uniquely evocative of an alien environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept is unique, but the storytelling impact is limited. It relies more on stating emotions/ideas ("sound of resolve," "dance of approval," "fusion of past and future") than showing them through action or subtext. The ending provides closure but lacks resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the core concept (necromancy + space spelunking + movie control) is original, the execution contains some generic phrasing ("symphony of discovery") and surface-level emotional portrayal ("small smile"). The movie control mechanism borders on feeling like a gimmick rather than an organic element.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates the elements adequately, but the overall piece lacks the polish and depth expected for top-tier publication. The unusual combination of elements feels more novel than profound, and the narrative doesn't leave a strong lingering impact.</comment>
