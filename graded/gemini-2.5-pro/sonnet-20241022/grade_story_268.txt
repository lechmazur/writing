<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is split between justice and mastering an art; the link feels underdeveloped. The 'artfully clumsy' attribute is stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or nuanced behaviour. The bead serves the plot but reveals little depth about Maya herself beyond her mission focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure (surveillance, preparation, imminent action) is clear within the word count. However, the core method (funhouse mirror tech blind spots/location tracking) requires significant suspension of disbelief and lacks technical plausibility, weakening coherence. Pacing is adequate for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned hospital setting and the 'screaming silence' tone are effectively evoked and complement the character's isolation and mission. The funhouse mirror feels slightly incongruous initially but is integrated as a key tool. Good use of atmosphere to support the narrative's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (mirror, bead) effectively. The central conflict is clear. However, relies heavily on stating themes ('price of war', 'true justice') rather than purely showing them through action and subtext. The ending hints at resolution but feels abrupt given the build-up. Shows potential but lacks resonant depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The funhouse mirror surveillance concept offers originality. However, the narrative leans on familiar tropes (lone vigilante, ancient forgotten art, corrupt officials) without significant subversion. Some phrasing borders on clich√© ('screaming silence', 'fragmenting reflection'). Feels competent but not distinctly unique in voice or execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave disparate elements, with moderate success. The mirror and setting work well, but the martial art motivation feels less integrated than the vigilantism. The piece functions as a compelling scene or prologue but lacks the self-contained polish and depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
