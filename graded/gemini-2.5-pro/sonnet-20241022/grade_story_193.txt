<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Aldrich's transformation feels passive, prompted entirely by the external magical figure rather than stemming from deep internal struggle or realization. His motivation shifts conveniently, and he lacks a distinctive voice or complex inner life within the narrative's confines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear (setup, inciting incident via storm/visitor, resolution), but relies heavily on the deus ex machina of the old woman. The core action (grinding memories) drives the thematic shift, but the cause-and-effect feels magical rather than psychologically earned. Pacing is adequate but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office setting is thematically resonant with borders, transitions, and the past, strongly supporting the narrative. The storm effectively creates isolation and facilitates the encounter. However, sensory details, while present, aren't exceptionally vivid or unique.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story uses clear symbolism (mortar, key, office), but it borders on the overt. The theme of transforming sorrow is present but delivered somewhat explicitly. While pleasant, it lacks profound emotional resonance or significant subtext; the craft is competent but not masterful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The central concept of grinding memories offers a spark of originality, but the overall structure (exiled royal, magical helper, found purpose) is highly archetypal. The prose is clean but lacks a unique stylistic signature, feeling somewhat generic and formulaic in its progression and emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The assigned elements are incorporated cohesively, but the story feels constructed around them rather than flowing organically from a deeper source. It achieves a sense of completeness but lacks the spark of true creative ingenuity or lingering depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
