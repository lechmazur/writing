<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (closure, decoding) and linked to the object (cutlass), but the 'physician' aspect feels underdeveloped until the final reveal, lacking consistent influence on her actions or voice throughout the main narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (inciting incident, journey, discovery, resolution) driven by the inscriptions/cutlass. However, the coffee grounds 'method' feels more symbolic than causal, and the pacing within the temple discovery feels somewhat rushed due to the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The jungle temple atmosphere is effectively evoked and linked to the cutlass/inscriptions. However, the initial 'digital nomad camp' setting feels incongruous and underdeveloped, detracting from overall atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (cutlass, coffee grounds, final anchor/caduceus) and establishes a clear theme about confronting the past and the nature of truth/curses. However, the reveal feels somewhat direct ('telling' more than 'showing'), and the overall impact is competent rather than deeply resonant or unique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious AI tells like jarring shifts, the narrative relies heavily on familiar adventure tropes (mysterious artifact, lost temple, conspiracy). The language is functional but lacks a distinctive authorial voice or truly fresh metaphors, feeling somewhat generic in execution despite the potentially original combination of elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story struggles to make all assigned elements feel organic; the digital nomad camp, in particular, feels extraneous. While it achieves a narrative arc within the word count, it reads more like a competent assembly of parts than a seamless, impactful whole where the constraints enhance the story.</comment>
