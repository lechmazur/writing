<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character feels underdeveloped beyond the surface traits; the 'underestimated rebel' aspect is asserted rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought. Motivation shifts abruptly from job duty to rescue without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a basic arc but relies heavily on convenient timing (sister's arrival) and objects (taco). The core concept of 'adaptation' is stated too explicitly, hindering narrative subtlety. Pacing feels rushed, particularly towards the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent use of setting with adequate sensory details (rust, rain, cobwebs), establishing a conventional haunted house atmosphere. However, it relies heavily on genre tropes without adding significant originality or a unique interpretation of 'ephemeral gloom'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Thematic elements (adaptation, sisterhood) and symbolism (knife) are present but handled overtly, lacking subtext. The rushed ending and explicit dialogue ("We adapt," "Wonder's not dead") diminish emotional resonance and rely on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Writing lacks a distinctive voice, employing familiar phrasing ("beam slicing," "shadows pooled") and genre clich√©s (ghost clown). While avoiding egregious errors, the prose feels functional rather than inspired, and the combination of elements feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The integration of disparate elements feels forced rather than organic, particularly the cuisine/taco aspect, which disrupts the established tone. The story seems constructed *around* the elements rather than using them to serve a deeper, pre-existing narrative vision.</comment>
