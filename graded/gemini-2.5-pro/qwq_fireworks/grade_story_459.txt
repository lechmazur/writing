<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Eli's core motivation ("liberation in letting go") feels asserted late rather than organically driving his initial actions; his ghost-seeing and technician roles are functional but lack deep integration. The "elegantly clumsy" trait is superficial, barely impacting the narrative beyond a minor clatter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit. The metaphorical use of "dissect" works adequately. Pacing is generally effective, though the resolution feels slightly brisk. Cause and effect are logical within the established paranormal premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is highly original and effectively creates a unique, resonant atmosphere. It synergizes well with the themes of preservation, fragility, and lingering presence. The "dissonance of silence" concept is strongly supported by the setting's description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story employs effective symbolism (crown, bell, silence) and achieves a degree of emotional resonance. The central conflict is clear and resolved satisfyingly. The theme of resolving past echoes is evident, though the final reflection on liberation feels slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is original, the narrative arc (helping a ghost find peace) follows familiar tropes. Some phrasing ("fractured whispers," "sandcastle crumbling") is evocative, but others verge on predictable sentimentality. It avoids overt AI markers but lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive whole, feeling more like a deliberate narrative than a checklist exercise. The brevity works, creating a focused vignette. The core concept and setting are particularly well-utilized, elevating the piece.</comment>
