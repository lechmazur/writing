<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The transformation from 'baffled pickpocket' to insightful poet is far too rapid and lacks psychological credibility, even within a fantastical premise. The motivation shift feels externally imposed by the dummy rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges entirely on the acceptance of a highly unusual premise (poetry battle with a dummy). While the arc (theft -> confrontation -> transformation) is clear, the resolution feels abrupt and overly convenient within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The engine room setting and atmosphere are effectively rendered with good sensory detail, strongly supporting the transformation theme. However, the assigned timeframe ('between appointments') is barely present and adds nothing, feeling tacked on.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dummy, engine) and metaphor, and the central conflict is clear. However, the dummy's dialogue is often stiff exposition, and the ending relies too heavily on stating the theme ('telling') rather than purely 'showing' the epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the *combination* of elements offers novelty, the execution relies on familiar tropes (haunted object, sudden redemption arc) and occasionally employs slightly overwrought gothic language. The dummy's pronouncements lack nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion despite the disparate elements, and the core concept is intriguing. However, the rapid, profound character change strains credulity, making the piece feel more like a clever exercise than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
