<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation (coaxing life) is clear and drives his actions, but the "theoretically rebellious" attribute feels superficial and disconnected from his meticulous, almost ritualistic method; it's stated rather than demonstrated effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, linking the comet, weathervane, album, and planting. However, the core mechanism—how angles translate to specific flower placements—remains abstract, relying on magical logic rather than clear cause-and-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strongly realized through evocative descriptions of the ghostly orchard and the menacing comet, effectively supporting the hermit's isolation and the story's blend of decay and potential rebirth. Sensory details are generally well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of imagery and symbolism (Weeping Star, flowers as code, grief into growth), creating resonance and subtext. The ending provides thematic closure, though the central conflict is more atmospheric than interpersonal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels relatively fresh, avoiding overt clichés. The language is often poetic, though occasionally risks becoming slightly overwrought ("pulsed like distant supernovas"). It avoids obvious AI tells and maintains a consistent, if slightly detached, voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most assigned elements cohesively, particularly the setting, object, and action, serving the central theme of renewal. The brevity feels intentional, creating a focused vignette, though the "rebellious" trait feels less organically woven in.</comment>
