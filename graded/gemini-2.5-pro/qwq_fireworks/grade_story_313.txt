<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The character arc from con artist seeking distraction to someone contemplating defiance is present, but the transition hinges heavily on a single piece of ghost advice. The motivation feels somewhat externally imposed rather than deeply internalised initially. The "unusually normal" attribute is mentioned but doesn't significantly shape personality or action, feeling tacked on. Voice is consistent but lacks exceptional distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot structure provides a clear, albeit simple, arc within the word limit: establishing stasis, inciting incident (ghost advice), climax (merchant encounter), and resolution (changed perspective). Interrogating ghosts drives the inciting incident. However, the core action assigned ("comfort") is poorly represented; the character seeks distraction and then defiance, not comfort. Pacing is adequate, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is effectively rendered with evocative details ("cracked earth," "withered crops," "sickly yellow sun"), creating a strong, bleak atmosphere that supports the character's internal state and the theme of decay/scarcity. The ghosts fit seamlessly into this desolate world. The connection between the setting and the empty dispenser (scarcity, decay) works well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (dispenser as mirror/emptiness) and imagery effectively. It establishes a clear internal conflict and explores themes of remorse and defiance. However, the impact is somewhat muted; the emotional resonance feels slightly surface-level. The ending offers thematic closure but lacks a truly powerful punch. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Showing vs. telling is generally competent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the ghost interrogation concept offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar dystopian tropes and somewhat standard internal conflict arcs. Phrases like "gnawing at her ribs," "jaws of defeat," and the slightly forced "unusually normal" detract from freshness. The symbolism of the empty object isn't particularly novel. Emotion is handled adequately but lacks deep nuance. Feels competent but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion, integrating most elements reasonably well, particularly the setting, object, and character type. However, elements like "unusually normal," "mild fervor," and especially the assigned action "comfort" feel poorly integrated or misinterpreted, weakening the overall structure. The dispenser serves the story, but the narrative feels somewhat constrained by fitting the pieces together rather than flowing entirely organically.</comment>
