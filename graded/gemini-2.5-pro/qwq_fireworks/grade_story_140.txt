<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character arc from denial to acceptance is present but compressed and reliant on convenient external prompts (ghostly sister, talking doll), making the transformation feel abrupt and somewhat unearned within the word count. The 'tortured protector' aspect feels more stated than demonstrated prior to the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a basic arc, but coherence suffers significantly due to the contrived appearance of the planetarium projector *within* the dressing room; this 'method' element feels illogical and forced. Pacing is rushed, sacrificing depth for plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is effectively rendered with evocative sensory details (smell, sight), creating a strong atmosphere of decay and forgotten secrets that complements the story's themes. The timeframe enhances the mood of transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While utilizing symbolism (doll, stars) and establishing a clear conflict/theme, the craft suffers from occasional overwriting ("kaleidoscope of light and sound") and relies more on telling emotional shifts ("recoiled," "breath steadied") than consistently showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The ending feels somewhat sudden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story combines familiar tropes (haunted object, chosen one, past trauma) without significant subversion. The planetarium element feels particularly artificial. Emotional portrayal lacks deep nuance, often stating feelings directly. Prose is functional but lacks a truly distinctive voice or consistently fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to feel entirely cohesive, primarily due to the awkward integration of the 'planetarium show' method. It reads more like an exercise in incorporating assigned elements than an organically conceived narrative. The brevity feels more like a constraint impacting depth than a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
