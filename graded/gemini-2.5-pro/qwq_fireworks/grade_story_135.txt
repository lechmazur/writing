<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation (documenting dialects) and loyalty are clear drivers, but the 'ambitious brewer' trait feels entirely superficial, mentioned once for bartering and then forgotten, failing to shape her personality or actions meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and effectively driven by the method (deciphering the poster). It achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the 'withstand' action feels more thematic than a direct plot engine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor setting with mechanical caravans is vividly realized and atmospheric, strongly supporting the themes of decay, endurance, and hidden knowledge. Sensory details are well-employed, creating an immersive mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (straw, bruises, ice) elevates the narrative. The central conflict and theme of preserving lost voices are clear and resonant, leading to a poignant ending. Dialogue is functional, serving the plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept offers originality, blending linguistic preservation with a unique fantasy setting. While generally avoiding clich√©s, some phrasing ("steel cord in her chest") borders on the familiar. Emotion is mostly shown effectively, avoiding excessive telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story feels largely cohesive, integrating most elements effectively (except the 'brewer' aspect). The assigned elements generally serve the narrative, and the brief length feels purposeful, leaving a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
