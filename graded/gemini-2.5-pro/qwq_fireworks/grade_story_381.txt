<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (mapping) is clear, but the 'hushed necromancer' aspect feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the core actions beyond fueling crystals; her specific skills don't deeply inform her personality or problem-solving beyond a surface level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a functional arc (map-obstacle-resolve-goal), but the resolution of the conflict via a movie quote feels convenient and slightly contrived, lessening the impact of the 'dominate' action. Pacing is adequate, but the structure lacks significant surprise or depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting and 'futuristic nostalgia' tone are vividly rendered and work well together, creating a strong atmosphere; however, the specific *crystalline* nature feels more aesthetic than deeply integral to the core themes of necromancy or memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates good craft through its blend of genres and use of symbolism (cap, movies), but the emotional impact feels muted, relying on the novelty of the concept mix rather than deeply explored character arcs or complex thematic resonance. The ending is poignant but slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the *combination* of elements offers originality, some narrative beats (taming the creature non-violently, the lost partner's memento) lean on familiar tropes. The prose is competent but occasionally uses slightly common phrasing ("resolve crystallized"), preventing it from feeling truly unique or stylistically groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, but the assigned elements sometimes feel more like a checklist being ticked off rather than emerging organically from a singular vision; the necromancy element, in particular, feels less integrated than the film/mapping aspects.</comment>
