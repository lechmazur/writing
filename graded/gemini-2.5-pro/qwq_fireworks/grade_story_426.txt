<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (preserve medicine), but the 'angrily peaceful' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated. The 'Forgotten Prodigy' backstory is delivered via clumsy exposition from the antagonist, weakening character depth. The hacking skill feels slightly disconnected from the core pathfinder/apothecary identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, using the ghost train setting effectively. However, the connection between hacking music playlists and finding coordinates for folk medicine feels contrived. The resolution (conductor dissolving, map appearing) is abrupt and overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park ghost train setting is evocative and well-integrated, enhancing the secretive, decaying atmosphere. Sensory details like static and rusted tracks are effective. The teapot's connection to the setting via the glyphs is a strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (teapot, flower) and thematic depth (tradition vs. corporate greed), but the execution is hampered by the brevity and reliance on telling over showing. The final hug offers a moment of resonance, but the overall impact is muted by a somewhat predictable conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the *combination* of elements has potential originality, the execution leans on tropes (evil pharma tycoon, forgotten chosen one). The conductor's dialogue ("Prodigy... They called you that once") is clich√©d exposition. The link between marathon training and music hacking feels arbitrary and slightly nonsensical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements; some feel forced (marathon training, the specific hacking method's link to medicine). While ambitious, the narrative feels more like a collection of interesting parts than a seamless whole, constrained rather than enhanced by its brevity.</comment>
