<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's core conflict (fact vs. feeling) is clear, but the initial "fact-minded" nature relies slightly on telling; the "desperately casual" attribute feels underdeveloped and minimally impactful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and coherent emotional arc (panic -> realization -> acceptance) effectively within the word limit, driven logically by the visions and the character's internal shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked through the unstable dimension and weeping library, effectively mirroring the internal state, though the "whispered minute" timeframe feels less integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (compass, library) and strong thematic resonance regarding empathy; the narrative effectively 'shows' the character's transformation, leading to a purposeful ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While avoiding obvious AI pitfalls and demonstrating competent craft, the piece uses some familiar phrasing ("clawing at her ribs") and follows a recognizable self-discovery arc without significant subversion or truly unique stylistic flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion, integrating most assigned elements purposefully to serve a clear theme; it feels thoughtful and complete, though perhaps lacks the exceptional originality demanded at the highest level.</comment>
