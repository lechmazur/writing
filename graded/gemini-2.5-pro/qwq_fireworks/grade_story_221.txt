<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'ghost whisperer' attribute is central and drives interaction, but the 'wreck-diver' aspect is entirely extraneous and unsupported. Motivation ('step out of the shadow') is present but feels somewhat generic until the climax; the character's internal state beyond melancholy lacks nuance until the final laugh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (ritual -> revelation -> resolution) within the word limit. The action ('arouse') effectively triggers the climax. Pacing is adequate, though the revelation via the letter feels slightly convenient. Cause and effect are logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting (abandoned arctic carnival gallery) is highly atmospheric and effectively integrated with the theme of frozen legacy. Sensory details are strong (frosting breath, peeling posters). The object (amber) and setting connect well thematically (frozen joy/loss). The timeframe ('between the lines') is cleverly incorporated via the letter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (amber, ice, insect). It achieves a degree of emotional resonance, particularly melancholy and eventual release. The central conflict (tradition vs. freedom) is clear and resolved purposefully. However, the theme of breaking free, while present, could be explored with greater depth or subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (ghostly ancestor, family burden) without significant subversion. Some phrasing ("joy and loss crystallize," "crackled like frost") borders on purple prose or clich√©. The 'wreck-diver' descriptor feels like an arbitrary, unintegrated element, potentially indicative of formulaic generation. Emotional portrayal lacks deep nuance until the final moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated reasonably well, serving the narrative, though the 'wreck-diver' attribute is a notable exception. The story feels cohesive despite the constraints, achieving a sense of completeness. The brief length works for the focused arc. It leaves a lingering sense of release, but lacks profound depth.</comment>
