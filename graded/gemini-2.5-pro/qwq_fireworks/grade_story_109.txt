<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'cold-natured' attribute thaws too rapidly, lacking the nuanced progression expected. The 'knight' archetype feels superficial, mostly metaphorical rather than deeply integrated into behaviour beyond initial stiffness. Motivation feels slightly contrived as an entry point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the action ('support') and method ('altars') to create a clear arc within the word limit. However, the resolution with the chief and other agents feels somewhat convenient and abrupt, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively established, contrasting the cold exterior/agency with the warmth of the folk remedies and altars. Sensory details are present, but the 'secret agent center' itself remains somewhat generic ('black cube', 'fluorescent lights').</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mitten, altars, phoenix) and achieves emotional resonance. The theme of finding humanity through connection and art is clear. However, the chief's quick acceptance lacks sufficient grounding, slightly weakening the final impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements offers some originality, but the core emotional arc relies heavily on the familiar 'thawing ice queen' trope without significant subversion. Some phrasing ("icy shell," "rebellious heart hummed") borders on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements competently and achieves cohesion. However, it lacks the exceptional depth, stylistic distinction, or profound insight required for the highest tier, feeling well-executed rather than truly groundbreaking.</comment>
