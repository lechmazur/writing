<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mara's 'sincerity' is stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought; her motivation is clear but lacks depth, and the confrontation with the mother-specter feels emotionally underdeveloped and narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a recognizable arc but feels formulaic and rushed, particularly the resolution where reciting an oath magically halts demolition; the connection between cause (oath) and effect (library saved) lacks grounding within the established logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The haunted passage setting is effectively evoked with some good sensory details, but the 'between storms' timeframe feels poorly integrated until the climax, and the specified 'braided bitterness' tone is asserted late rather than consistently woven throughout the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth (adapting tradition) but handles it superficially; literary devices are present but not particularly striking, and the emotional impact is muted by a somewhat predictable trajectory and a neat, unearned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on familiar tropes (haunted library, spectral guide, legacy defender) without significant subversion; the language employs some clich√©s ("peeling like skin," "rustling pages"), and the overall execution lacks a distinctive voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the elements are technically incorporated, the story feels constructed *around* them rather than flowing organically; the narrative lacks stylistic distinction and fails to leave a memorable or resonant impression beyond fulfilling the prompt's requirements.</comment>
