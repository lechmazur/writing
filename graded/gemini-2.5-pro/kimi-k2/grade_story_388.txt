<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character is a functional archetype for the mythic plot but lacks a distinct voice or deeper personality beyond her role as "melodic sculptor." She serves the story but doesn't feel like a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is well-structured and complete, but the coherence is significantly weakened by the "sudden road trip," which feels like a clumsy, inorganic exposition dump to introduce a necessary object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A story of immense creative potential and beautiful craft, particularly in its world and use of language. However, it is held back from perfection by a thin character and a glaringly awkward plot device that feels forced.</comment>
