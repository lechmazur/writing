<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's profound epiphany feels slightly abrupt for a hardened trapper, making him more a well-realized vessel for the theme than a character whose transformation feels entirely earned within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is commendably coherent and complete, but the central mechanism—microfilm that whispers coordinates and resolves into a metaphorical lens—is a narrative convenience that sacrifices logical rigor for thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength; the fusion of a tangible, gritty setting ("rusted corridors," "salt-stained grating") with a cosmic, philosophical scale is masterful and deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, particularly the sustained and powerful central metaphors (loss as a net, trapping absences) that elevate the narrative into a memorable, thought-provoking work of art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable cohesion; every assigned element feels not just included but essential and seamlessly integrated in service of the story’s potent thematic and emotional core.</comment>
