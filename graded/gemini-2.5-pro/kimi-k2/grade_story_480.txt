<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is sharp and consistent, and her specific attribute ("quietly loud") is integrated well into the climax. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly too quick to be entirely earned, even for flash fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length, with a clear and satisfying arc. The receipt functions perfectly as a narrative key, linking the beginning, middle, and end with precision and logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its atmosphere. The fusion of the occult (frankincense, chants) with modern decay (ramen packets, dust-thick air) creates a unique, memorable, and deeply immersive world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates masterful craft, using potent symbolism (the "regret" fuse, the burning avatars) to explore a resonant theme of seeking authenticity in a digital world. The prose is dense with effective, striking imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The central concept of a social media exorcist ministering to her "familiar stranger" followers is highly original, effectively subverting genre tropes. The authorial voice is distinct and avoids any hint of formulaic or AI-like construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels like a deliberate and polished piece of flash fiction, not a constrained exercise. It successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive, impactful narrative that lingers with the reader.</comment>
