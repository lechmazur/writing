<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is established clearly and tested, leading to a meaningful transformation from an active "map maker" to a receptive "voice." Her interiority is uniquely embodied through the heat-mapping technology, avoiding cliché. The final shift in understanding is earned by the climactic encounter, and the cost—the obsolescence of her former role—is felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The narrative builds density through sensory and emotional detail, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax where the very definition of "mapping" is transformed. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost (her old purpose is gone), and the final line provides a perfect cadence shift, demonstrating exceptional control of form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active force in the narrative. The coastal cave network, with its specific sensory details like the smell of "iron and regret," directly pressures the protagonist's choices at the fork. The key recurring object, the fossil, serves as a "micro-setting" that constrains action and is indispensable to the final, resonant image of becoming a scar over the heart. This is a masterful integration of environment and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—to map the unknown before hibernation ends—and escalates it effectively under an Accumulative lens. The pressure deepens decisively upon the discovery of the sleeper, shifting the conflict from external exploration to internal reception. This turn is driven by Lira's agency in choosing to engage, and the cost of her transformation is made unmistakable on the page when her recorder goes silent, its purpose superseded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme is developed with subtlety and power, exploring the nature of listening versus speaking. The final line, "The voice travels forward by listening back," functions as a potent Conceptual Repricing. While it borders on a "thematic echo," its delivery through the wrist screen makes it a diegetic conclusion rather than authorial moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The risk is high, but the execution succeeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person POV is controlled with masterful precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance while modulating tone to match the rising tension. The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and possesses a unique perceptual signature through the "heat-mapping emotions" device. This creates a prose texture that is both beautiful and integral to the story's world and character, with no unearned knowledge or breaks in focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative ("dreams leaking outward in slow pulses of indigo curiosity"), and figurative language is integral to the story's synesthetic logic, never feeling ornamental. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished read.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's premise is highly original, blending science fiction concepts like post-hibernation and emotional data-mapping with a mystical, animist sensibility. This synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in its execution. The central conceit is explored to its logical and thematic conclusion without retreating into cliché, and the transformation of the protagonist's purpose provides a non-obvious and satisfying turn.</comment>
