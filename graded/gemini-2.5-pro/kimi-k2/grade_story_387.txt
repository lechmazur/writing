<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a selfless archetype than a person; her unwavering devotion to the mission, while consistent, lacks the internal conflict or nuance expected in top-tier literary fiction. She is a beautiful symbol, but a flat character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and poignant arc within the word count. However, its central turning point relies on a sudden, un-foreshadowed supernatural event (hearing laughter from the future), which feels more convenient than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The world-building is seamless and evocative, with the recycled spaceship and salvaged wind chimes creating a powerful, coherent atmosphere of melancholic history that perfectly supports the narrative's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious and the use of symbolism is masterful. Yet, the prose occasionally tips into being overwrought; the sheer density of metaphor and poetic language can feel self-conscious, slightly obscuring the narrative's emotional core rather than solely enhancing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the central conceit is highly original, the execution shows minor signs of formula. The repetition of "intangibly tangible" and the character's perfectly logical, non-human reaction to a miracle suggest a polish that feels more algorithmic than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is a commendable fusion of disparate concepts into a cohesive, poetic whole. However, it feels so ethereal and built on abstract principles that it lacks a certain grounding, leaving it feeling more like a beautiful, fragile thought experiment than a visceral story.</comment>
