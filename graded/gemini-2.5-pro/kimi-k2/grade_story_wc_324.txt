<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her primary internal shift is articulated through a diagnostic label rather than dramatized. The line, “Yet incidental heroism, she was learning, began exactly there,” functions as an unearned epiphany, summarizing the theme rather than showing a complex internal process. While her actions are consistent, her interiority feels more like a statement of purpose than a lived, contradictory experience under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is simple but coherent: a call, an investigation, an accumulation of tasks, and a resolution. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Mara accepts her ongoing role, with the cost felt in the final image of the "heavier" photograph. The structure is well-suited to the story's length and goals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with evocative sensory details (“wet marble and old roses,” “damp velvet”) creating a potent atmosphere. More importantly, key objects—the tracer, the hearing aid, and especially the photograph—are not decorative. The photograph directly constrains the central interaction with the old man and is powerfully re-charged in the final line, making it indispensable to the story’s emotional closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing peace for the nameless dead—is clear and compelling. Escalation works well for the accumulative lens, as the pressure builds from one ghost to a crowd. The tightening occurs when Mara accepts her role as an active bridge rather than a passive observer. The cost of her success is the emotional weight she carries forward, which is made tangible in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and bearing witness is potent, but its delivery is hampered by overt authorial statements. Lines like “to protect vulnerable voices meant not only the living but also the dead” and the “incidental heroism” reflection explicitly state the story’s thesis. This thematic echo replaces subtext with summary, significantly weakening the resonance that the powerful final image otherwise earns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the material perfectly. The psychic distance is well-controlled, and the prose has a clear rhythmic quality. The dialogue of the spirits is simple and direct, creating an effective contrast with the richer narration. The point of view is stable and effectively filtered through Mara's unique perceptual tools.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in its imagery. The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures and precise word choices creating momentum. While a few sentences lean toward direct telling (“Mara was persistently curious by trade and by nature”), the piece is free of significant clutter, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a clean and impactful read.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" using a hearing aid rewired for "longing" is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It transforms the familiar ghost story trope into a poignant exploration of grief and remembrance. The story’s specific, quiet mechanics for spiritual release feel fresh and earned within the world's logic, demonstrating a strong, singular vision.</comment>
