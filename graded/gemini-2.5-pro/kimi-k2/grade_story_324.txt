<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the portrayal relies on explicitly stating his insecurity ("I was the insecure advisor") rather than purely showing it, which slightly undermines the sophistication of the voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight, delivering a complete and resonant narrative arc with a satisfying twist within the word limit. The pacing is masterful, building tension without feeling rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the setting and tone is the story's greatest strength. The atmosphere is dense, specific, and immersive, using evocative sensory details ("ozone and old lies," "walls sweating data") to create a memorable and coherent world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high caliber, rich with purposeful literary devices and significant subtext. The central theme of identity and reality is explored with depth, culminating in a powerful, lingering final question.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable originality by taking familiar sci-fi tropes (brain in a jar, abandoned HQ) and subverting them to serve a fresh, philosophical purpose. The prose feels authored and distinct, avoiding formulaic language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is a cohesive and impactful whole, with all elements serving the central theme and tone. It feels like a deliberate, polished piece of short fiction that successfully punches far above its weight class in terms of thematic depth.</comment>
