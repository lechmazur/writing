<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maraâ€™s transformation from "sullen" to zealous is too swift to be psychologically convincing; she feels more like a symbolic vessel for the theme than a character with a tangible inner life. Her "farmer" attribute is mostly set dressing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is a clear and complete arc, but the pacing is breathless. The sudden, un-foreshadowed appearance of the "townsfolk" is a significant narrative convenience that undermines the story's otherwise tight internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The "underwater city power station" is a brilliantly imagined, atmospheric setting that is both original and metaphorically resonant with the story's themes of forgotten power and drowning in despair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious and the extended metaphor is potent. However, the prose verges on overwritten, with a relentless density of figurative language that feels self-conscious. The theme is also stated too explicitly, sacrificing subtlety for clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the core concept is highly original, some of the prose feels overwrought. The phrase "objectively biased" is a conspicuous and logically awkward oxymoron, a stylistic flourish that momentarily breaks the narrative spell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a powerful, fable-like narrative. Its primary achievement is its potent central metaphor, though this comes at the cost of some character and plot nuance.</comment>
