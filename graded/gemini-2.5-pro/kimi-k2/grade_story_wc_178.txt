<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Naram-Sin's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent: a frugal man of science seeking certainty in a mystical world. The internal conflict between his mistrust of gifts and his reliance on the magical tile is perfectly pitched. The final choice, where his frugality informs his weighing of personal glory against cosmic order, is a masterful and earned culmination of his established character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal drive. Every step, from the introduction of the tile to the signing of the covenant, follows a clear because/therefore logic. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change combined with a Conceptual Repricing, where the cost of order is made tangible and permanent on the page. The structure is elegant, tight, and serves the concept perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, a "labyrinth of dusk and silence" that "reimagined itself" and "answered" the protagonist. The palace itself constrains the central action, functioning as the lock Naram-Sin must open. Sensory details are specific and poetic ("hummed with the low bronze of twilight," "charcoal ground from date pits"), creating a dense, unforgettable atmosphere that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing cosmic order—is established early and remains the unwavering focus. The pressure tightens beautifully when the tile, a mystical object, freezes into a pattern matching a lost constellation, forcing the empirical astronomer to act on faith. The climax presents a stark trade-off with a clearly legible and permanent cost, resolving the conflict with profound consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of sacrificing personal knowledge and ambition for a greater, unseen order emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids any moralizing, instead delivering its resonant point through the final image: Naram-Sin with his now-useless lens, having given away "the right to count [the sky's] turns." This is a perfect, non-literal answer to the central question of devotion's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The third-person POV is controlled with masterful precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and elevated, fitting the mythic tone without feeling overwrought. Naram-Sin's perceptual signature is distinct; his worldview, shaped by measurement and thrift, colors every observation, making the voice feel both epic and deeply personal, as in the perfect phrase "Empirically ironic."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is the story's greatest strength: luminous, dense, and rhythmically flawless. Figurative language is consistently original and precise, as in "every corridor curved like a question mark toward the sky." There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no awkward phrasing; every sentence serves to build character, atmosphere, and momentum toward the powerful, quiet conclusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>This story synthesizes familiar elements of mythology and history into a uniquely compelling and memorable narrative. The premise of a "frugal astronomer" as the custodian of cosmic machinery is a fresh, specific angle. The resolution, which hinges not on gaining power but on relinquishing knowledge, feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable, marking a truly original vision.</comment>
