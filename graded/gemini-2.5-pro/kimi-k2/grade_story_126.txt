<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but the transformation from guilt-ridden survivor to "deranged prophet" is too abrupt. He functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than as a nuanced individual, his internal journey condensed to the point of being a caricature of repentance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is a simple, clear arc, but it hinges on the absurdly literal action of climbing a poster. This strains coherence, pushing the narrative from compelling symbolism into heavy-handed allegory, and the symbolic resolution lacks tangible weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength, with evocative and efficient world-building. However, the setting feels more like a theatrical stage designed for this single symbolic act rather than a decayed, once-functional world, which slightly undermines its verisimilitude.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is saturated with metaphors ("chrome cathedral," "shattered constellations of glass," "honest milk of memory"), becoming overwrought. It mistakes relentless poeticism for depth, resulting in a narrative that feels suffocated by its own literary ambition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the juxtaposition of elements is novel, the core archetype—a complicit perpetrator finding redemption at the world's end—is a familiar trope. The style feels less like a unique authorial voice and more like a skillful imitation of the high-minded literary sci-fi genre.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but its allegorical machinery is too exposed. The elements feel meticulously assembled to prove a point rather than serving an organic narrative. The result is intellectually interesting but emotionally distant and artistically overdetermined.</comment>
