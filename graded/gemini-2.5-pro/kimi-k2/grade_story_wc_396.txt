<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, embodied interiority. Her core motivation—duty—is immediately clear, and her unique gift of tasting emotions is shown, not just told, through concrete actions like "sorting emotions by texture." The change is marked by the cost to her tool, the fragment, which serves as a powerful proxy for the personal cost of her peace-keeping, foreclosing a path and making her choice resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The plot advances not through causal action-reaction, but through an intensification of emotional textures, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the treaty settling). The closure is powerful and on-page, with a clear, felt cost in the crystal fragment becoming inert, making the "before/after" state of the world legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in integration, functioning as both atmosphere and a core constraint on the conflict. The "lighthouse orchard on black basalt cliffs" is a brilliant, paradoxical image that grounds the entire story. The micro-setting of the lantern room, with its scavenged, scarred mirrors, is not just a backdrop but the essential mechanism for the resolution, directly charging the final image and enabling the protagonist's climactic action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—averting a war that could "drown them all"—is established in the first paragraph and remains the central focus. The conflict escalates through the accumulation of painful glimpses, deepening the sense of imminent catastrophe rather than through conventional plot turns. Mara's agency is decisive; she actively manipulates the empathetic currents to forge a resolution, and the cost of her success is made tangible in the spent power of the fragment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as a constructive, active force is woven beautifully into the plot, character, and central metaphor. The resolution avoids didacticism, offering a resonant final image of shared light that answers the story’s central question. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the final sentence ("when empathy was mapped onto action"), which restates what the preceding scene already demonstrated with more power, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the mythic quality of the story. POV is tightly controlled, and Mara’s perceptual signature—experiencing emotions as physical textures—is consistent and provides a unique lens on the events. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, moving from the tense ascent of the stairs to the focused calm of the mirror work, demonstrating masterful control of narrative distance and tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery ("grief smooth, anger jagged, hope thin as blown glass"). There is a high degree of information density in each line without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm. The piece is nearly flawless, though the sheer richness of the figurative language walks a fine line, just avoiding self-consciousness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing familiar fantasy elements—seers, merfolk, magical artifacts—into something genuinely new and resonant. The core concept of "mapping empathy" through reflected pain is an ingenious transformation of the seer trope. The resolution, a quiet act of emotional weaving rather than a confrontation, feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable, marking a truly distinct artistic vision.</comment>
