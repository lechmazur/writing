<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "mercenary" label feels unearned and disconnected from the mystical, internal conflict; the character's core transformation relies on an external push from a ghost rather than a fully developed internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is a well-compressed and coherent arc, but its central turning point depends on a convenient ghostly intervention, a narrative shortcut that slightly undermines the protagonist's agency at the crucial moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's absolute strength is its atmosphere; the setting is not merely a backdrop but a deeply integrated, evocative space that embodies the central themes with superb and specific sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, particularly the potent symbolism of the dollhouse and the resonant theme of redefining one's destiny. The writing is polished and impactful from start to finish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the prose itself is stylish and fresh ("shadows like bruised moons"), the narrative's spine is built on familiar tropes—the ghostly mentor and the portal-in-an-object—which tempers its originality despite the beautiful execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a masterful cohesion of tone and theme, weaving its elements together with impressive skill. It is held back from the highest tier only by a character archetype that doesn't quite fit and a slight reliance on a conventional plot device.</comment>
