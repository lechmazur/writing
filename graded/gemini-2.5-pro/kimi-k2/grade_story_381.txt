<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subversion of "necromancer" into a preserver of memory is a significant strength. However, the character's internal "voice" feels more like a vessel for the theme than a distinct personality; her defining trait of "hushed" makes her slightly too passive on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and well-paced within the word count. The primary weakness is the resolution's convenience; discovering a perfect, ready-made crystalline theater feels less like a hard-won victory and more like narrative wish-fulfillment, softening the story's potential impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The integration of the crystalline cave setting with the story's core themes is the piece's greatest achievement. The cave as a sentient, projecting memory bank is a superb concept, creating a powerful atmosphere that almost completely overcomes the vagueness of the world outside it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The piece uses symbolism effectively, but it undermines its own craft by explicitly stating the central theme ("The necromancer's power wasn't deathâ€”it was preservation..."). This robs the reader of the satisfaction of inference and feels like a lack of confidence in the story's own subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of necromancy, geology, and film preservation is highly original. The core premise, however, rests on the familiar sci-fi trope of rebelling against a sterile, digital future, which prevents the story from feeling entirely groundbreaking despite its unique execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a singular, memorable concept. It is held back from excellence by a lack of subtlety in its thematic statements and a too-convenient resolution, marking it as a strong concept that requires further refinement to reach a publishable standard.</comment>
