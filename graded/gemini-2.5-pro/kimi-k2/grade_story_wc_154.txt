<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. Lin's internal conflict between her professional identity as a detached translator and her personal role as a vulnerable sister is rendered with specificity and embodied emotion ("stomach fold like wet paper"). The contradiction is held in scene, not just summarized, culminating in her choice to perform a personal ritual (giving the coral), an act of translation beyond words. The brief appearance of Dr. Vanna provides the precise external pressure needed to crystallize Lin’s final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The plot, an internal journey, progresses through deepening layers of anxiety, with the discovery of the cipher acting as a significant turn that reweights the initial stake. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing: Lin's ritual act of giving away the coral doesn't change the physical reality of the injury but reconfigures its meaning with a palpable conceptual cost—accepting that memory and trauma persist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric specificity and function. The "mist-clad atrium" is not just a backdrop; its scents and sounds create a palpable "anesthetic hush" that mirrors and intensifies Lin's internal state. The two key objects—the cast and the coral fragment—function as potent micro-settings that constrain all key actions and charge the final, resonant image of the garden. The environment is inseparable from the story's emotional and thematic core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's conflict is primarily internal, and its escalation is handled with subtlety and precision. The dominant stake—Lin’s fear and guilt—is established immediately. The discovery of the cipher deepens this stake from a personal anxiety to a shared trauma, a powerful escalation. The final conversation with the doctor provides a final tightening, forcing Lin to confront the permanence of the wound and prompting her decisive act of renunciation, which carries a clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Thematic development is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story explores how trauma is archived in bodies and communities, and how meaning can be "translated" or "grafted" onto wounds without erasing them. This is achieved entirely through the recurring, evolving imagery of the coral, the cast, and the tide. The final image of polyps blooming as "small brave words" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, controlled, and demonstrates a powerful perceptual signature; Lin consistently sees the world through the lens of a translator ("gunfire into grammar," "pleas into pronouns"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with her internal state. The limited dialogue is purposeful, carrying significant subtext and advancing the emotional plot cleanly. POV remains tightly controlled, creating an intimate and immersive experience without a single slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical, dense, and demonstrates exceptional control at the line level. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful ("bodies keep archives of every explosion"). The piece avoids almost all scaffolding or redundancy. A minor deduction is for a single phrase, "lotus-hearted ache," which feels slightly overwrought and momentarily drifts into a register that is more poetic than the established narrative voice, a hairline fissure in an otherwise flawless surface.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing disparate elements—a conflict zone translator's psyche, a sterile hospital, marine biology, and cryptography—into a coherent and moving whole. It elevates the familiar "waiting room" trope into a profound meditation on trauma and healing. The specific, non-obvious choices, particularly the cipher on the cast, feel surprising yet inevitable in hindsight, marking this as a singular and memorable piece of fiction.</comment>
