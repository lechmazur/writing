<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation and internal conflict are rendered with exceptional clarity and specificity. Her transformation from a passive, grieving archivist of loss to an active cultivator of defiance is earned through the scene's crucible. The line "her curse was carrying the grief of every vanishing" establishes the stakes perfectly, and her final choice is a direct, costly response to this burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and memory until it culminates in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where the noticer redefines her task from guarding memory to "coax[ing] the future from refuse," is earned and lands with a tangible cost in the line, "I will forget a little, if you will grow a little." The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, embodying the themes of decay and stubborn survival. Details like "moss that had swallowed marble" and "palace walls loomed like cracked teeth" create a potent atmosphere. Crucially, the courtyard is transformed from a symbol of loss into the physical medium of the protagonist's resolution, directly enabling and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story masterfully handles an internal, existential stake: how to endure in the face of pervasive loss. The pressure deepens through the interaction with the tea house keeper, which reframes the protagonist's agency. The final choice to plant seeds is a powerful act of defiance that directly addresses the conflict, and the cost—the acceptance of forgetting—is made explicit and felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning after loss is explored with profound subtlety and emotional honesty. The story never preaches; instead, its central questions emerge organically from concrete actions and images, like the offering of bread and the planting of seeds. The final image of the single shoot provides a resonant, non-literal answer that beautifully recontextualizes the entire narrative without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, establishing a distinct and consistent perceptual signature for the "noticer." The voice is lyrical and melancholic, perfectly attuned to the story's atmosphere, and the sparse dialogue is resonant with subtext. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the protagonist's pensive, observant state of mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and dense with imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. However, a few phrases, such as "voice heuristically gentle," feel slightly too authorial and intellectualized, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless flow of the character's perception. While a minor point, this slight register drift in a key moment prevents a perfect score in this category.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of the "creeping normality noticer" is highly original and provides a fresh, poignant lens for a story about grief and resilience. The narrative transforms the trope of a post-collapse world by focusing on small-scale, personal acts of reclamation. The synthesis of this unique character with the act of guerrilla gardening as a form of absolution feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
