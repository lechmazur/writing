<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central character's method—tasting emotions in jam—is overly fanciful and strains credulity, slightly undermining the otherwise grounded emotional core of her trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The resolution of a significant psychological trauma via a single healing touch feels too swift and convenient, diminishing the emotional weight and complexity of the established conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The highly imaginative setting is the story's greatest strength, creating a potent, memorable atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the story's themes of fragility and connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's premise is unique and memorable, but the core dynamic between a troubled protagonist and a serene, wise healer follows a familiar archetypal pattern, even if executed well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Despite its beautiful atmosphere and cohesive structure, the story's central emotional arc is weakened by a whimsical premise (the jam-tasting) and an overly simplistic resolution.</comment>
