<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's emotional core as "lovelorn" is powerfully realized and drives the narrative, but the "spy" profession feels like an unexploited genre trapping rather than a deeply integrated aspect of his actions or psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The psychological arc is tight, complete, and well-paced for the word count. However, the specific action "gloat" is inserted somewhat mechanically, feeling more like a prompt fulfillment than a natural character beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The world-building is exceptional, using specific, evocative sensory details to create an atmosphere that is not just a backdrop but an active antagonist and thematic engine. It's immersive and masterfully executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is sophisticated, with a powerful central metaphor of the avalanche that is expertly developed. The story achieves significant emotional impact and thematic depth, slightly marred only by a final sentence that risks diluting the focus of the tight third-person perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The writing demonstrates a highly original and literary voice, skillfully revitalizing cyberpunk tropes. The prose is fresh and avoids formulaic pitfalls, with the minor exception of the "broken dreams" clich√© early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is remarkably cohesive and demonstrates immense creative ambition. It functions as a potent, self-contained emotional experience, leaving a memorable final image. It is extremely close to the highest standard of publishability.</comment>
