<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The 'haunted mercenary' is a tired archetype, and his defining trauma is delivered via a single line of exposition rather than shown, making him a functional but thin vessel for the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a predictable quest-and-redemption arc that resolves too neatly; the magical mechanism feels convenient and its rules are loosely applied, weakening the narrative's internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the imagery of the cathedral is evocative, the prose frequently strays into being overwrought, with a density of poetic descriptors that lessens their individual impact and feels overly labored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on a central, somewhat obvious symbol (the trapped spider) and provides a resolution so complete ("his hands steady") that it feels emotionally simplistic and lacks lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a common redemption trope and conspicuous repetition of key phrases ("carefully reckless," "slow fade"), which reads as formulaic rather than a deliberate stylistic choice, suggesting a lack of authorial confidence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>This reads more like a successful exercise in element integration than a story with its own urgent, authentic voice. Its technical cohesion cannot mask a fundamental lack of narrative risk or originality.</comment>
