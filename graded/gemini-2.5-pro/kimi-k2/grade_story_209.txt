<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is powerfully rendered through the symbolic mapping of his grief. However, the "seasoned woodsman" archetype feels more like a thematic overlay than an integral identity, connected only by the slightly strained metaphor of mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is tight and symbolically coherent, with a clear progression from grief to catharsis. The leap into magical realism at the climax—with antennas broadcasting his confession—feels like a convenient shortcut, sacrificing psychological plausibility for a tidy, supernatural resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" is a brilliantly realized and original setting that perfectly encapsulates the story's themes of decay, memory, and faint hope. The atmosphere is potent and masterfully sustained, serving as the story's strongest element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally high, with dense, evocative imagery and potent symbolism. However, the prose verges on being overwritten; its relentless lyricism feels self-conscious and risks suffocating the raw emotion it seeks to convey. It is a work of immense artifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality in its fusion of disparate elements, avoiding cliché in its core conceit. The emotional journey is nuanced, yet the highly stylized, fable-like quality of the narrative questions its psychological authenticity, feeling more like a perfectly constructed allegory than a raw human experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a stunning cohesion, weaving its many prescribed elements into a seamless symbolic tapestry. Its primary strength—this intricate, poetic construction—is also a potential flaw, creating a piece that one admires for its cleverness more than one feels in the gut.</comment>
