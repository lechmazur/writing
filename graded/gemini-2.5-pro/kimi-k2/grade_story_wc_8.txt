<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Characterization is strong and consistent, but the core internal conflict between rationality and outrage is stated more than dramatized as a simultaneous, contradictory impulse in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds perfectly toward a causal shift in strategy, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a visible, thematically integrated cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both metaphor and constraint; the impossible train whistle is a masterful touch that constrains the protagonist's interpretation and charges the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake is clear and deepens effectively when the protagonist's strategy shifts from excavation to persuasion, a turn driven by her own agency with a legible future cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme is developed with nuance through powerful imagery, but the final, explicitly whispered moral ("Truth also wounds…") is a thematic echo that slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The formal, controlled voice is perfectly suited to the historian protagonist, establishing a distinct perceptual signature that remains consistent and modulates effectively under rising internal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong figurative language and no significant artifacts, though the final sentence is slightly less rhythmically taut than the preceding text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story transforms a familiar "historian uncovers a secret" trope through highly specific, memorable details (the vellum scraps, the railway setting) that make the execution feel fresh and insightful.</comment>
