<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "overworked detective" archetype feels like a genre shortcut, a thin veneer over the much more compelling (and central) character of the grieving sister. The motivation and voice are strong, but the stated profession is not fully integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The psychological arc is well-structured within the word count, but the entire resolution hinges on the discovery of a perfectly looping security tape from a decade prior. This is a significant narrative convenience that feels more like a plot device than an organic discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully rendered, but the central setting's name—the "Vanishing Point Gallery"—is thematically heavy-handed. It sacrifices subtlety for an obvious metaphor, which slightly cheapens the effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense with striking imagery and effective symbolism (the kaleidoscope). However, its relentless literary quality feels self-conscious at times, as if the story is overly aware of its own craft. The impact is strong, but not seamless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the narrative subverts the standard detective procedural, the final twist—the protagonist's forgotten role in the key event—is a well-worn trope in psychological fiction. Originality lies in the execution, but not the foundational plot turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>A commendably cohesive and ambitious piece where most elements serve the theme. However, its visible mechanics—the convenient video, the on-the-nose symbolism—prevent it from achieving the flawless, effortless quality required for the highest tier. It is very good, but not invisible in its craft.</comment>
