<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Octavia’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are perfectly aligned with her specific characterization. The internal conflict is clear, and her final shift from seeking closure to accepting an ongoing duty is an earned, resonant change. The contradictory impulses—to preserve a legacy while erasing its shame—are embodied in her precise, almost ritualistic actions. The emotional progression feels authentic to this highly controlled character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive with flawless internal logic. The central causal chain, though fantastical (proof causes decay), is presented with such conviction that it functions perfectly within the story's rules. The closure unit is superb: a Decisive Change (the satellite is destroyed) leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the realization that regret splinters, creating an ongoing task), with the cost of eternal vigilance made tangible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmosphere and function. The observatory is not merely a location but an essential tool that constrains the protagonist's options and enables her unique solution. Details are both lyrical and purposeful, from the "brass fittings on an old ship’s wheel" to the "vaulted stone throat." Crucially, the micro-setting of the meteorite sheet and pen nib becomes the stage for the climax, fully integrating environment and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story focuses on a single, potent stake—the orbit of regret—and escalates the pressure effectively through the journalist's imminent arrival. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost is both elegant and severe: victory is not an end but the beginning of a new, more granular struggle. This final turn, where the problem fragments rather than vanishes, makes the cost unmistakable and deepens the conflict beautifully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of confronting and managing legacy, rather than simply erasing it, emerges with exceptional power from the central metaphor. The final image of Octavia preparing to pen another "contradiction" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The journalist's slightly on-the-nose question, “‘So orbits of regret can be disproven?’”, briefly risks overstating the theme, but Octavia's clipped, specific answer ("Mathematically") skillfully preserves the story's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is the story's great strength: elevated, precise, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that perfectly matches Octavia's character. The prose has a poetic, almost lapidary quality that remains controlled even at its most lyrical. POV is handled with flawless discipline, creating a completely immersive experience within Octavia's hermetic world and intellectual process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level control, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, turning what could be overwriting into a powerful, sustained stylistic choice. The final few paragraphs contain slightly more abstract summary ("the confession rewritten as smaller confessions") than the preceding concrete scene work, a minor shift in texture that is the only hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar performance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core concept—using mathematical proof as a form of tangible, elegant intervention against a symbolic legacy—is brilliantly original. The synthesis of astronomy, newsprint empires, and a kind of intellectual magic feels entirely fresh and inevitable in hindsight. This story takes a significant conceptual risk and executes it with such confidence and style that it establishes its own memorable reality.</comment>
