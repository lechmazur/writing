<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's core conflict between healer (veterinarian) and transgressor (hunter) is potent, but the climactic turn from hunger to reverence is too abrupt. The epiphany feels instantaneous rather than earned, making the transformation less credible for a character whose motivation was initially so strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies on a significant contrivance: finding the specific, still-functioning drone optic by "rummaging in abandoned motels." This crucial plot device feels convenient rather than inevitable, slightly undermining the narrative's structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, blending high-tech decay and vibrant biomechanics with dense, evocative imagery. The atmosphere is vivid and immersive. The "train whistle's echo" is a masterfully unsettling detail that establishes a surreal, post-human melancholy from the first sentence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's craft is strong, particularly its use of symbolism (the bucket). However, it falters by explicitly stating its central theme ("the taboo was not the gland itself but the act of taking it..."). This robs the reader of the satisfaction of inference and feels like a failure of confidence in the subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept and its execution are highly original, avoiding genre clichés. The language is fresh and specific. However, the central narrative device—an epiphany delivered through a sudden, overwhelming vision—is a familiar trope that feels slightly too neat for an otherwise unique story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion and a powerful, lingering impact. The elements are integrated with thematic purpose. Its primary weakness, preventing it from achieving perfection, is a tendency to favor expediency in the plot (the drone) and explication in the theme, which holds it back from the highest literary tier.</comment>
