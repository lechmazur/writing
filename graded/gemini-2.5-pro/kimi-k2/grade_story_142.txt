<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's arc from seeking wealth to cultivating legacy is compelling but feels slightly rushed within the word count, making the final transformation a bit too neat for a top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is remarkably coherent and complete for its length, but the swift pacing and a convenient magical element (the instructional film) slightly weaken its rigorous logic under critical scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are exceptionally realized; the setting is not just a backdrop but an integral, symbolic part of the plot, and the tone is masterfully sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with rich symbolism and subtext, but the theme is stated too explicitly by the spirits at the end, and the prose occasionally verges on being self-consciously lyrical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, but the relentless density of the poetic prose, while atmospheric, can feel overwrought and stylistically artificial, bordering on 'purple prose' which we would flag.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and memorable story that integrates its constraints into strengths, though its stylistic density and slightly convenient resolution hold it back from flawless execution.</comment>
