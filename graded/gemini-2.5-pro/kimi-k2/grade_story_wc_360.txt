<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The character's motivation to solve emotion like an equation is clear and drives the narrative. Her arc from detached observer to an embodied participant in emotional "mathematics" is compelling, culminating in the shift to her "own unborrowed uncertainty." While the characterization is powerfully aligned with the central concept, it remains slightly more a vessel for the idea than a fully idiosyncratic personality, a minor trade-off in an otherwise exceptional piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds through a cascade of sensory details and conceptual shifts, leading to a perfect Conceptual Repricing for its closure. The final realization ("empathy inverted") and the subsequent reversal of the press constitute an on-page change with a legible cost—the cracked halo, the ashen prints, and the dissolved borrowed personality—making the story's abstract logic visceral and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmosphere and integration. The topaz workshop is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, with the press acting "unbidden" and the floorboards "pacing." The environment, including the vanishing stars and the halo fragment, directly constrains the character's choices and charges the final image, fulfilling the highest demands for setting as a narrative force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The conflict escalates beautifully under the Accumulative lens, moving from a controlled experiment to a chaotic leak of emotion that disorients the protagonist. The stake—proving her theorem—is tested and deepened until it inverts. Her final choice to "reverse the process" is an act of clear agency, with the subsequent losses providing an unmistakable and fitting cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme—the immeasurable nature of empathy—emerges organically from the story’s central conceit and its failure. The subtextual power of the ambiguous sentence ("I was never here" / "stay") is a highlight. The final line states the new "theorem" directly; while this is justified by the character's mathematical framing, it verges on thematic summary, slightly reducing the resonance that a purely imagistic ending might have offered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The voice is the story's triumph, maintaining a consistently lyrical, precise, and intelligent tone that is entirely its own. The protagonist's perceptual signature, filtering everything through the language of astronomy and mathematics ("parallax," "vectors," "denominator"), is brilliantly sustained. The prose achieves a rare synthesis of poetic density and narrative clarity, with no slips in POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose is audacious in its density of figurative language, a high-risk style that succeeds completely. Each sentence is crafted for maximum impact and information, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating exceptional control over rhythm and syntax to match the story's emotional and conceptual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally original, weaving typography, metaphysics, and astronomy into a coherent and resonant whole. The central premise of transposing empathy via letterpress is fresh and memorable, and the story commits to its strange logic with unwavering confidence. This synthesis of disparate fields creates a singular work that feels both innovative and inevitable.</comment>
