<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recluse's motivation is exceptionally clear and his arc from scribe-in-exile to keeper-of-silences is earned and satisfying. His final choice to add his own strip and remain has a palpable cost, solidifying his transformation. While direct internal conflict is minimal, his focused actions and perceptive shifts effectively convey a deep internal journey, making his final state of "tranquilly perceptive" feel like a hard-won resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for its length, operating under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. The narrative progresses from a state of seeking to a powerful Conceptual Repricing (the covenant as confession) that lands with undeniable weight. Closure is achieved through a beautifully rendered Earned Stasis, with the cost of the recluse's new role felt in the final quiet moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph, functioning not as a backdrop but as the primary text for the protagonist to read. Details like the "dark amber rivulets" of melted honeycomb acting as "runes" are masterfully integrated, directly enabling the story's central epiphany. The atmosphere is thick and purposeful, with every sensory detail contributing to the "mute eloquence" of the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central stake—understanding the covenant—is established immediately and deepens perfectly through the ghosts' guidance. The shift from reading a single parchment strip to interpreting the entire ruin provides a meaningful escalation of pressure, consistent with the textural drive. The final resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's agency, and the cost is his acceptance of a permanent, lonely vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story explores its theme—the weight of unspoken words and the failure of contracts versus confessions—with profound subtlety and grace. The theme emerges organically from the central images of the box, the ruined hives, and the ghosts themselves, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The final image of ghost bees refracting covenant light provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, creating a voice that is both lyrical and precise. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic cadence that perfectly embodies the "mute eloquence" of the world. The narrative distance is consistent, and the choice to end on a deliberate fragment enhances the story’s resonance, leaving the reader in a state of charged silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, evocative figurative language, and controlled rhythm. Every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the narrative's textural understanding. There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwrought passages; the language is rich but always serves the story's core with precision and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing disparate concepts—post-apocalyptic ghosts, beekeeping, and scholastic covenants—into a cohesive and poignant whole. The premise feels entirely fresh, transforming familiar tropes into something deeply specific and memorable. The core idea of a covenant failing because ghosts carry unspoken truths is an ingenious and powerful narrative engine.</comment>
