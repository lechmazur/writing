<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct, but the sister is a symbolic foil, not a character. Her conversion is predicated on a symbolic act, not credible psychological change, making her feel like a plot device to resolve the central theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent within its surrealist logic, with a clear arc. However, the central turning point—the sister's change of heart—is emotionally unearned and feels convenient, weakening the narrative's structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The juxtaposition of the mundane (laundromat) and the mythic (giant's study) is inspired, and the sensory details ("candle smoke and iron filings," "machines churned with starlight") are superb and world-defining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Craft is ambitious and the use of symbolism is potent. However, the prose is so dense with metaphor that it occasionally draws attention to itself at the expense of the story, creating an intellectually admirable but emotionally cool distance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the central conceit is highly original, the piece is marred by self-conscious, on-the-nose phrases. Describing a character as "conventionally rebellious" and stating the intended tone ("haunting delight") are authorial intrusions that break the narrative spell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>A work of undeniable imagination that is ultimately let down by a perfunctory emotional core. The style is striking but cannot fully compensate for a pivotal character interaction that feels more like a thematic transaction. It's close, but not flawless.</comment>
