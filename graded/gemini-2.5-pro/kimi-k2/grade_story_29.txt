<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but Rowan himself functions more as a well-executed archetype for hope than a deeply nuanced individual, a minor weakness in a story aiming for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story exhibits a masterful and complete narrative arc within the severe word constraint; the pacing and internal logic are nearly flawless, creating a sense of a full journey in miniature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength; the author uses highly specific and evocative sensory details to create a tangible, memorable atmosphere that is perfectly integrated with the story’s theme and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the use of fresh, resonant symbolism (the jigsaw piece, the amber droplets) to explore a deep theme of healing, resulting in a powerful and emotionally satisfying impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While using a familiar quest trope as a foundation, the story’s execution is highly original, with unique concepts (Regret Engine, hope as a frequency) and fresh figurative language that demonstrate a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its remarkable cohesiveness; it integrates a host of disparate elements not just successfully but synergistically, creating a narrative that feels deliberate, resonant, and much larger than its word count.</comment>
