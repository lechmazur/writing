<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central paradox of an exorcist with stage fright is brilliantly conceived and executed. The motivation to "sculpt possibility" feels slightly too much like an authorial thesis statement, rather than a purely organic character thought, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in economy and coherence, with every element linking logically to the next. The structure is nearly flawless for flash fiction, held back only by the slight convenience of "liquid starlight" as a required plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph. The setting of orbital debris is not merely a backdrop but a central, evolving metaphor for the story's themes of trauma and reconstruction. The integration of setting, tone, and character is seamless and powerful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The piece is a tour de force of literary craft, built on layers of potent symbolism and subtext. The central conflict's resolution is both surprising and deeply satisfying. The prose is so consistently poetic that it borders on breathless, narrowly missing perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise is exceptionally original, and it subverts genre tropes with intelligence. However, the narrative's clockwork perfection and intricate symbolic logic feel so precisely constructed that they risk seeming artificial, lacking the subtle messiness of a purely human-authored text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>This is a superb, cohesive, and deeply intelligent story that uses its constraints to create symbolic density. It demonstrates immense creative thinking and leaves a lasting thematic resonance. It is a top-tier piece of literary flash fiction, ready for a discerning audience.</comment>
