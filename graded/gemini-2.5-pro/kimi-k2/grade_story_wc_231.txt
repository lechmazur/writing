<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and his internal journey from observer to guardian is compelling and earned. His emotions are well-embodied, particularly the shock of the received memory ("vivid as a wound"). However, the interiority occasionally slips into summary, stating his realization directly ("the keeper understands now she came to transfer the forgetting") rather than letting the insight remain fully embodied within the preceding images.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the structure builds methodically from mystery to investigation to revelation and finally to commitment. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the keeper accepts his new role—is earned, poignant, and lands with the clear, felt cost of carrying another's grief, fully satisfying the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterful, with sensory details that are both vivid and purposeful. The setting is not merely a backdrop; the "negative spaces between pilings" become a physical manifestation of the mental "gaps" the keeper must observe. The Edelweiss, an object functioning as a micro-setting, is indispensable, as its "alien" scent is the precise mechanism for the story's climax and its presence charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The internal stake—understanding the stranger's legacy and deciding what to do with it—is established early and deepens with powerful emotional weight. The progression from intellectual puzzle to a visceral, wounding memory and finally to a sacred duty represents a superb escalation under an Accumulative lens. The keeper's agency in choosing to accept this burden is clear, and the cost is made unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, grief, and bearing witness emerge organically from the story's powerful central images—the gaps, the circle, the Edelweiss. The final image of the keeper writing provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines that verge on thematic summary, such as "to remember until the forgetting is complete," which explains the process a little too neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with discipline and artistry, creating a consistent and deeply immersive experience. The narrative voice is the story's greatest strength: a lyrical, melancholic, and highly specific prose that perfectly matches the keeper's character and the tale's somber beauty. The perceptual signature, focusing on absence and texture, is distinct and masterfully maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with information. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, at times bordering on overwriting ("petals so fragile they seem to exhale"). While many images are stunning, their sheer frequency slightly dulls the impact of the strongest ones. A more selective deployment would elevate the piece from "beautifully written" to "flawless."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While built on familiar tropes (the lonely keeper, the mysterious woman), the story transforms them completely through its unique and poignant central conceit of memory bequeathal. The synthesis of a stark maritime setting with an alpine memory is fresh and thematically powerful. The story's originality lies in its quiet, emotional-conceptual logic, which feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
