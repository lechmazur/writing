<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'wreck-diver' aspect feels superficial, used only metaphorically ("submerged wreck") and not meaningfully integrated into the character's actions or immediate experience beyond that single line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The internal arc (decision to break tradition leading to resolve) is clear within the word limit, but the plot relies heavily on introspection; the assigned 'arouse' action is passive (arousing spirits' attention) rather than driving significant external events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively rendered using sensory details (dust, flickering, stale popcorn), strongly supporting the melancholic tone and character's state, though the abandoned carnival setting itself borders on being a convenient trope for ghosts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent use of symbolism (amber, thawing heart) and captures a specific emotional state (joyful melancholy), but lacks truly fresh insights or exceptional literary flair needed for the highest tier; the central conflict is internal and resolved somewhat predictably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements is somewhat unique, but the execution feels safe, relying on familiar emotional arcs (breaking free from obligation) and metaphors (thawing heart, trapped insect) without significant subversion or startling originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated serviceably, but the story feels slightly constrained by fitting them in (especially 'wreck-diver'), rather than feeling entirely organic; it achieves cohesion but lacks the undeniable spark of truly exceptional, publishable short fiction.</comment>
