<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character serves primarily as a thematic vessel; motivation is clear but abstract, lacking deep psychological nuance or a distinct voice beyond the assigned traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot is static, describing an ongoing process rather than a narrative arc with development or tension. Coherence feels strained by the combination of disparate elements like the plant study and mask reconstruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The setting ('plant communication study') provides an interesting backdrop but remains underdeveloped and feels disconnected from the character's core activity and internal struggle. Atmosphere is present but lacks rich sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong central symbolism (masks, mirror, carbonization) and clear thematic exploration are strengths, but the narrative relies too heavily on telling rather than showing, limiting emotional impact and subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Significant repetition of key phrases ("dizzyingly grounded," "noble foolishness," "belonging nowhere," etc.) creates a formulaic feel, lacking stylistic originality and nuanced emotional portrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story feels constructed *around* the assigned elements rather than using them organically; the repetitive style and somewhat forced connections detract from overall cohesion and impact.</comment>
