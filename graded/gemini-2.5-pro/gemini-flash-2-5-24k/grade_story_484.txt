<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and linked to the brewer's craft, but the 'uniquely generic' attribute feels asserted rather than organically demonstrated, slightly undermining the character's distinctiveness. The 'flippant solemnity' is present but subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit simple, arc driven by the 'initiate' action and the specific 'method'. However, the 'uniquely generic' concept feels more like commentary than a plot driver, and the protest timeframe adds atmosphere but little narrative impetus within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation, effectively blending the haunted setting with the brewer's internal state and the 'encroaching darkness'. Sensory details are present, though the 'protest lull' timeframe feels slightly peripheral to the core scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable thematic resonance regarding finding value in ordinary craft against existential dread. Symbolism (fermentation, light/dark) is effective, but the repeated insistence on 'uniquely generic' feels heavy-handed and detracts from subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The core concept has originality, but the execution relies on some familiar tropes (haunted mansion, mysterious stain). The phrase 'uniquely generic' is self-consciously meta and feels artificial, bordering on an AI-like attempt at subversion rather than genuine nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements (brewing, horror), but the integration isn't seamless. The 'uniquely generic' label and the underdeveloped 'protest' element slightly weaken overall cohesion and impact, preventing it from feeling fully realized.</comment>
