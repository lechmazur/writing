<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts abruptly from writing obituaries to reviving theater with little connective tissue. The 'rebellious' trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal conflict. The initial unique trade feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses from A to B but relies on convenient discoveries (hidden chamber) rather than character agency. The connection between the revolutionary setting and the personal quest to revive theater feels superficial. Pacing is rushed, particularly the transition to the final goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere of revolution is stated but doesn't permeate the library scene effectively. The "giants of lore" and "giant's bookshelf" feel like generic fantasy elements lacking specific detail or integration. Sensory details are sparse, hindering immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("Elara knew this was her chance") rather than showing. While symbolism (mask, organ) is present, it feels somewhat heavy-handed. The central conflict lacks sufficient development within the word count, and the ending feels more like a setup than a satisfying conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The initial concept (obituaries for the living) is original, but the execution devolves into familiar tropes (magical object, hidden chamber). Phrasing like "palpable tension," "towering sanctuary," and "surge of energy" borders on clich√©. The combination of elements feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate its disparate elements; the obituary aspect feels particularly extraneous to the core narrative involving the mask and theater. The elements often feel like constraints being checked off rather than organic components serving a unified vision.</comment>
