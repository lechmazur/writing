<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character attributes ("unsure," "precisely playful") feel contradictory and superficially applied rather than deeply embodied. Motivation ("cultivate sparks") is vague and disconnected from the symbolic object (coin purse).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a basic discovery arc, but the core concept ("broken precedents") is poorly integrated and feels like an afterthought. The labyrinth method is overly literal and convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The workshop setting is evoked adequately with some sensory detail, but the "golden age" timeframe adds little substance. The "fractured beauty" tone is stated more than consistently achieved through description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling ("Elara stood in awe") rather than showing. Symbolism (purse, mask) is present but lacks subtlety. The ending feels unearned and overly declarative. Central conflict is weak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Suffers from overly ornate and clich√©d phrasing ("heart of the golden age," "labyrinthine corridors," "cascade of light"). Character reasoning lacks nuance, and the narrative follows a predictable discovery template. Feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The assigned elements feel stitched together rather than organically integrated; the story seems constructed *around* them, hindering cohesion. The style attempts literary flair but often results in purple prose.</comment>
