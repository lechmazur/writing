<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character is a flat archetype whose defining trait, "softhearted," is repeatedly stated but never convincingly demonstrated through nuanced action. She serves as a mere functionary for the high-concept plot rather than a developed individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot is a summary of events, not a narrative with tension. The protagonist faces no obstacles, risks, or costs, making the "stabilization" feel like a foregone conclusion and robbing the story of any genuine conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The world concept is strong and the planetarium setting is evocative, but the primary police station setting is little more than a framing device, underutilized and disconnected from the core action of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has an intriguing central theme but relies heavily on telling over showing. Core emotional states and character traits are explicitly declared, and the abstract nature of the conflict prevents any tangible narrative tension from building.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The execution feels formulaic, combining familiar tropes (soft-hearted cop, ancient artifact saving the future) without subversion. The prose is self-consciously ornate, and the frictionless resolution feels more algorithmic than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story reads as an intellectually clever exercise in combining assigned elements, achieving thematic cohesion at the expense of narrative vitality. It feels reverse-engineered from a prompt, lacking the emotional grit and unpredictability of top-tier fiction.</comment>
