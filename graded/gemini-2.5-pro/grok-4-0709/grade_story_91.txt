<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters serve as archetypes for the theme rather than feeling like nuanced individuals; their development is sacrificed for thematic clarity and plot function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and complete, but its resolution—an entire station's philosophy changing overnight—is overly simplistic and feels unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is well-evoked and the setting is functional, but the world-building relies on familiar tropes without adding enough specific detail to make it truly distinctive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story suffers from a tendency to "tell" rather than "show," explicitly stating character motivations and thematic conclusions that would be more powerful if left to inference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable, feel-good template, and the combination of disparate elements like "gangster fedora" and "gentle" feels more like an algorithmic mashup than an organic creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While cohesive, the story feels more like a skillful execution of a writing exercise than a work of profound artistic impulse; it lacks the ambiguity and psychological depth required for this level of publication.</comment>
