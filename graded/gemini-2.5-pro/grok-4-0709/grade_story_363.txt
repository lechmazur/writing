<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is strong and clear, but the core attribute ("passionately indifferent") is repeatedly stated rather than shown, feeling more like an authorial label than a lived-in trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is contained and complete, but the central method ("via after-images") is conceptually vague and logically weak, undermining the coherence of the character's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength. The contrast between the fading parade and the secretive hall is evocative and effectively grounds the story's poignant tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story leverages powerful symbolism (the silent bell) and thematic depth, but its impact is diminished by repetitive phrasing ("poignant," "hush") and a tendency to tell, rather than show, character states.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels highly formulaic, reverse-engineered to fit its constraints. The robotic repetition of key phrases and the logical leap in the plot method are strong indicators of artificiality, lacking an authentic authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While some elements (atmosphere, symbolism) are compelling, the story fails to feel cohesive. The elements feel like a checklist being ticked off, rather than organic parts of a whole, leading to a final product that has potential but feels fundamentally constructed and inauthentic.</comment>
