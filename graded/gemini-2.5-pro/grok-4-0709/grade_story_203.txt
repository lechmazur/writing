<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character concept is highly original, but the psychological resolution is too simplistic. The instantaneous evaporation of deep-seated stage fright upon a symbolic act lacks the nuance expected in top-tier literary fiction; it reads more like a fable than a genuine character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is tidy to the point of being contrived. The ghost's appearance at the precise climax of the personal ritual is a significant narrative convenience that undermines the story's believability, making the resolution feel earned by the plot's demands rather than the character's struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The juxtaposition of a mundane, almost childlike task (toy assembly) against the haunted, vast backdrop of an orbital debris field creates a potent and memorable atmosphere. The contrast between the organic wildflowers and the sterile sci-fi setting is masterful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious but suffers from a heavy-handed repetition of its own thematic phrases ("defiant hush," "sculpting possibility"). This functions as a narrative crutch, telling the reader the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise is wonderfully fresh, blending genres in an inventive way. However, the execution relies on a predictable "destroy the object, destroy the curse" trope, and the emotional arc feels more logical than authentically human, lacking the messy complexity of a true psychological shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A story with a brilliant, publishable-level concept and atmosphere that is ultimately let down by a formulaic resolution and a lack of subtlety in its thematic execution. It feels like an excellent draft that mistakes symbolic tidiness for satisfying depth.</comment>
