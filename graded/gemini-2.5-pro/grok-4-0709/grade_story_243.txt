<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the characterization itself is a composite of traits rather than a developed personality. The 'jumpy' attribute is integrated well, but the 'necromancer' aspect feels like set dressing until a convenient, late-story spell attempt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight and complete for the word count, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the resolution—pulling a 'spectral whistleblower' from the mural—is a deus ex machina that feels too convenient, undermining the preceding investigative work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength, with evocative, setting-specific details ('chiptune sky,' 'frozen cascade of code'). The atmosphere of glitchy paranoia is effective, but it is undermined by the forced and mismatched inclusion of the assigned tone, 'clear complexity'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story suffers from significant craft issues that would prevent publication. The repetition of the phrase 'typically bizarre' is lazy, and the insertion of 'In the clear complexity of the moment' is exceptionally clumsy, breaking immersion and revealing the author's hand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the execution shows signs of artificiality. Repetitive phrasing and the shoehorned-in tone word suggest a formulaic approach. The story relies on stating triumph rather than showing it, and character reasoning lacks nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The conceptual fusion of elements is highly creative and cohesive, a clear strength. Unfortunately, this strong foundation is let down by weak prose choices and a simplistic resolution. The story reads like a fantastic first draft that is not yet ready for publication due to these execution-level flaws.</comment>
