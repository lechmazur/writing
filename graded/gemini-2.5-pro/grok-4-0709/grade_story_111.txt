<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength, presenting a highly original and evocative atmosphere, though the specific "dog park" element feels more decorative than integral to the plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept is highly original, the execution relies on prose so dense with adjectives and a plot so neatly resolved that it verges on feeling formulaic and stylistically overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A cohesive and imaginative story that successfully integrates its core elements, but is ultimately held back from top-tier quality by self-conscious, ornate prose and a simplistic, all-too-perfect conclusion.</comment>
