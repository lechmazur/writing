<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a symbolic vessel than a person. His motivation is explicitly stated rather than organically revealed, and his transformation follows a neat, intellectual path that lacks psychological authenticity or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but entirely subservient to its symbolic structure. The cause-and-effect chain is one of internal, symbolic logic, which makes the narrative arc feel predetermined and a bit too tidy for its short length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is well-evoked and the setting is a strong metaphorical match for the character's journey. However, the symbolism is heavy-handed, with names like "Verdant Echo Institute" feeling overly pointed and lacking subtlety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story fails the 'show, don't tell' principle at critical moments, explicitly explaining its own metaphors (e.g., the masks reflecting his soul, the carbonizing symbolizing transformation). This strips the narrative of subtext and reader discovery, a significant flaw for this literary tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The conspicuous repetition of assigned phrases like "jigsaw puzzles" and "dizzyingly grounded" breaks immersion and suggests an artificial constraint. The prose borders on purple, and the emotional resolution feels too clean and logical, lacking genuine human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the elements are creatively and cohesively combined, the story feels reverse-engineered to fit them. The narrative serves the cleverness of the concept rather than the other way around, resulting in a work that feels more like an intricate exercise than an organic piece of fiction.</comment>
