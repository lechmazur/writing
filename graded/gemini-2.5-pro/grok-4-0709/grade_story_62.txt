<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation ("rewrite the code of existence") is too grandiose and abstract to be credibly established or explored within this word count; it feels asserted rather than earned, leaving Elias a vessel for a concept rather than a developed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc, but the central cause-and-effect relationship is tenuous. How telling a story to ghosts "chip[s] at existence's code" is a metaphorical leap the story fails to substantiate, weakening the plot's logical foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its atmosphere. The imagery of the spectral orchard amphitheater is inventive and evocative, creating a potent and memorable mood that effectively grounds the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by heavy-handed repetition. Key phrases ("candid deceit," "humble," "rarely honest") are used like a bludgeon, telling the reader what to think and stripping the prose of subtext and elegance. It shows its work too obviously.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution feels formulaic. The insistent repetition of the assigned prompt words reads like an exercise in satisfying a checklist, creating an artificial texture that lacks the nuance and organic flow of authentic prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story presents a fascinating conceptual sketch but fails as a polished piece. The elements feel more like constraints being conspicuously fulfilled than seamlessly integrated tools for storytelling. Ambition is present, but the execution is clumsy and overwrought.</comment>
