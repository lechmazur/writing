<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation pivots a bit too conveniently from immortality to legacy, feeling more like a narrative necessity to achieve a satisfying ending than a deeply earned character arc within the short word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is well-paced and complete for its length, but the central mechanism of the 'safeguard'—etching a complex map into a marble floor unnoticed—strains credulity and weakens the story's logical foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is highly imaginative and evocative, with the 'floating marketplace' setting used effectively as a symbolic mirror for the protagonist's precarious situation, representing a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully builds a thoughtful theme about legacy versus longevity, using strong symbolism, but it occasionally relies on directly telling the character's emotional state ("his uncertainty gnawing at him") rather than purely showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While built on some familiar tropes (the quest for immortality), the story combines them within a unique setting and a well-realized 'mundane miracles' tone, creating a fresh and non-formulaic narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A cohesive and thoughtful story where elements are well-integrated, but it's held back from the highest tier by a point of weak plot logic and a slightly unearned character resolution.</comment>
