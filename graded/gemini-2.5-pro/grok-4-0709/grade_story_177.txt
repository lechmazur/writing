<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character is an assemblage of high-concept labels rather than a person. The key attribute, "rebellious," is repeatedly stated instead of shown, which is a critical failure of craft. The "obituaries for the living" concept is intriguing but feels disconnected from the core action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot is structurally complete but executed like a summary. Key events, like the discovery of the chamber, are declared rather than experienced, resulting in rushed pacing that sacrifices narrative depth for a checklist of plot points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central image of the bookshelf labyrinth is strong and imaginative. However, the atmosphere is undermined by a reliance on explicitly stating the intended tone ("lucid frenzy") rather than building it organically through sensory detail and character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story fails the fundamental principle of "show, don't tell." Character traits, motivations, and tone are all explicitly declared to the reader. While the symbolism is present, the lack of subtext and the overwrought prose make the work feel unsophisticated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The incessant repetition of keywords ("rebellious," "frenzy," "revolution") feels highly artificial and formulaic. The prose is consistently purple, striving for a literary feel but achieving an ornate style that lacks genuine nuance or an authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the elements are combined in a clever and cohesive way, the story reads like a response to a prompt. The narrative feels constructed to service the assigned elements, rather than the elements serving an organic story. The execution is mechanical, not artful.</comment>
