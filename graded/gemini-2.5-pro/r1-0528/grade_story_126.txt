<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc and effective pacing for its length, but the nature of the "grand illusion" is abstract and the mechanism of discovery relies on a rapid intuitive leap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are impressively woven into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole that transcends being a mere checklist; the conciseness feels purposeful.</comment>
