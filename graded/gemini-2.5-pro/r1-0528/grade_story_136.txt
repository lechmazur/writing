<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "quiet matchmaker" character assignment is superficially addressed but not convincingly enacted through her primary actions, which are focused on solitary decoding rather than active matchmaking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot's coherence suffers as the facility's sudden, disproportionately catastrophic "purge sequence" in response to a localized experiment feels like a contrived escalation rather than a well-grounded consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The world-building, while atmospheric, presents minor ontological inconsistencies by blending "living rock" with decaying, scavenged technology without sufficient bridging clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is original, the narrative leans on the recognizable "forbidden knowledge/tech overload" trope for its climax, and some descriptive passages verge on the overly intense or melodramatic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is ambitious and thematically rich, but subtle weaknesses in character-action alignment, plot device plausibility, and explicit thematic exposition prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
