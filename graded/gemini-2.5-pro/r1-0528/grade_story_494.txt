<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's "arrogance" is somewhat asserted; his transformation via a single memory, while poignant, feels accelerated for deeply ingrained traits. The "doubtfully confident" aspect is better realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a standard crisis-response structure leading to character change; the arc is clear and complete for the length, though the resolution path is somewhat predictable for this genre.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "gravel crunching like brittle bones" are evocative, and the courtyard setting is thematically resonant, but the overall atmosphere, while supportive, doesn't achieve exceptional uniqueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (phoenix, tapestry) is effectively employed, and the dialogue is purposeful. However, reliance on some common literary phrases ("raw nerve," "pride was a cage") slightly tempers the distinction of the craft.</comment>
