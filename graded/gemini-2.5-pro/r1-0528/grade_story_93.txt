<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation for the immediate, extreme actions feels slightly underdeveloped despite the clear overall crisis and established core drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pirate radio solution for drone evasion is overly convenient; the crucial insight into chaos arrives too rapidly at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive is a strong, thematically resonant setting, though the "elevator door" timeframe is more symbolic framing than a literal plot constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powerful thematic core (order/chaos, unspoken bonds) and effective symbolism, yet the density of concepts leads to somewhat asserted rather than fully explored resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central concept of the fractal calling card as a "translator of chaos" offers originality, but the narrative leans on some convenient tropes (mentor's perfect gift, pirate radio efficacy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambitious conceptual integration is largely successful, but the sheer density of elements strains the short form, leading to some rushed plot mechanics and a feeling of being overstuffed.</comment>
