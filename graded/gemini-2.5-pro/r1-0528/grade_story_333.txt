<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent with her "sincere rebel" attribute, but her character, and especially Leo's, lack deeper psychological nuance beyond their functional roles in the preservation narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a compact arc, with the "theorize" action effectively driving it. However, the "constantly changing" attribute of the passage feels somewhat underleveraged as a dynamic obstacle within the plot's mechanics.</comment>
