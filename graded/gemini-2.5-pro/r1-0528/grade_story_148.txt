<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's core motivation for the central task feels abrupt and insufficiently rooted in her established "storm chaser" background, despite consistent subsequent actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on a convenient 'ancient schematic' discovery, which, while advancing the narrative, lessens the sense of earned revelation; structure is otherwise sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric contrast between desert past and alpine present, with rich sensory details effectively grounding the somewhat fantastical premise of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and a clear thematic arc of renewal are present, though some concluding descriptive language verges on sentimentality over subtle impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The unique combination of elements is a strength, yet the narrative employs some familiar descriptive tropes and a slightly too-neat resolution of the central mechanical puzzle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most elements is achieved, but the protagonist's background feels more like an applied trait for contrast than an organic necessity for this specific restoration journey.</comment>
