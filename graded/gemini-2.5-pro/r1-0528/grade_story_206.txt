<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's core traits are well-realized, though the initial integration of her dual motivations (Aethel/vendetta) and the speed of her emotional shift post-locket could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with an ingenious central method (photograph trail); Elara's conviction that the locket-giver could lead to Aethel is a slight narrative convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of the "forgotten market" and "rebellion" timeframe creates a strong, consistent atmosphere rich with relevant sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent thematic depth achieved through potent symbolism and a unique central conceit; the redefinition of Aethel provides a very satisfying impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original premise centered on candy artistry, avoiding significant clich√©s; minor repetition of "impossible" is a small blemish in otherwise fresh prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion in weaving numerous assigned elements into a creative and emotionally resonant narrative that feels deliberate despite its brevity.</comment>
