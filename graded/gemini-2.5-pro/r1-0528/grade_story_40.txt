<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "reincarnated" aspect, rich with potential, remains largely atmospheric rather than deeply integrated into Milo's current psyche; the pivotal past guilt is stated rather than viscerally shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on a highly convenient inciting incident (hailstorm), and the resolution for a centuries-old guilt feels disproportionately slight and somewhat forced by the symbolic fish liberation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Settings like the "Forgotten Recipe Library" are thematically appropriate but rendered with serviceable, rather than exceptionally vivid or unique, sensory details, failing to fully elevate the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its central metaphor ("The stagnant tradition wasn't just..."), a significant flaw in literary craft, and the emotional payoff feels minor given the profound nature of the established guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the core premise is original, its execution leans on some clich√©d plot mechanics (e.g., storm-driven discovery) and occasionally clunky phrasing, diluting its freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ambitious themes of perennial guilt and cyclical existence are introduced but are not explored with the depth or nuance expected, resulting in a narrative that feels somewhat superficial relative to its conceptual weight.</comment>
