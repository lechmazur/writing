<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Bertram's core motivation (reviving his wife) and his defining optimism are clear and drive his actions; however, the "doomsday prepper" facet feels more like contextual backdrop than a deeply influential trait shaping his choices or the narrative's core conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "ice cavern" setting and the "fractal sorrow" tone are exceptionally well-integrated, with the "colors of the unforeseen" and specific sensory details creating a deeply immersive and thematically resonant atmosphere that amplifies the character's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong literary craft through its evocative imagery (ice, colors), potent symbolism (watch band, lullaby), and effective use of subtext, leading to a poignant exploration of grief, denial, and acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative offers a highly original synthesis of its speculative and emotional elements, and handles emotion with nuance; however, a few descriptive phrases ("polite in their structured randomness") lean towards being overly elaborate, risking a touch of artificiality.</comment>
