<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's core attribute ("reservedly bold stoicism") is awkwardly phrased and more stated than shown; "phantom weight of blade" is a clich√©, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a standard, somewhat predictable quest structure (clue -> search -> discovery), making it competent but not groundbreaking for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric writing and vivid sensory details are a key strength, particularly the neon-decay aesthetic; the rose petal timeframe feels more symbolic than deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ambitious prose frequently borders on overwrought ("purple prose") and tends to state key character attributes or intense moments rather than consistently showing them subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the genre blend offers some originality, the narrative relies on several common tropes (haunted warrior, cryptic guide) and some metaphors/phrases feel generic or overly familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story feels somewhat constructed around its assigned elements rather than them emerging with complete organic inevitability; the prose, while often rich, lacks consistent flawlessness.</comment>
