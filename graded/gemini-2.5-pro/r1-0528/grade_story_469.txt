<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character attributes like "blameless" and "logically emotional" are largely asserted rather than seamlessly demonstrated through action or nuanced voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong plot progression and clear cause-and-effect, driven effectively by the "overreach" action within the tight constraint, creating a coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "Whispering Gallery" setting is exceptionally well-utilized to amplify tension; sensory details are evocative, though the assigned "tone" (grandiose modesty) is misaligned with the story's actual tense atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (key, garden) and resonant imagery creates impact, but the craft is weakened by explicit telling of some character aspects rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While generally avoiding formulaic pitfalls and maintaining a human-like nuance, some phrasing ("logically emotional response:...", "grandiose modesty manifesting...") feels overly expository or slightly clunky, detracting from full authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative is largely cohesive and maintains tension well; however, the assigned element of "grandiose modesty" feels poorly integrated and more like an authorial label than an organic story component.</comment>
