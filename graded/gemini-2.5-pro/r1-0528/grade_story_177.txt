<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "Obituarist" label feels more like flavour than a deeply integrated motivator for *this specific* sonic mission; its direct relevance is under-leveraged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "labyrinth of choices" is underdeveloped as a plot obstacle, being too easily navigated and thus diminishing its conceptual weight within the narrative structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'lucid frenzy' tone is primarily told (attributed to the character) rather than consistently shown through the narrative style, which often remains measured and descriptive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambitious imagery and themes are evident, yet the prose occasionally becomes overly dense or relies on grand statements that tell rather than fully embody emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality in concept is present, but some self-consciously 'literary' phrasing feels strained, and minor tropes (e.g., the false spine) slightly dull its unique authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The ambitious synthesis of elements is commendable, but under-utilized concepts (labyrinth) and moments of stylistic affectation prevent a truly flawless execution.</comment>
