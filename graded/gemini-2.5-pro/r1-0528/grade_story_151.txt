<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's capacity for "awe" in a post-emotion world is asserted more than viscerally explored; the "astronomer" aspect feels somewhat superficial beyond pattern affinity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The resolution via a single "perfect" snowflake feels overly convenient; the mechanism by which this translates into toppling a societal idol lacks plausibility within the narrative's established logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong, evocative imagery and consistent atmosphere ("crystal shadows," "lighthouse orchard") are a highlight, effectively grounding the narrative's more abstract concepts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and thematic ambition are present, but key insights are stated too directly, diminishing subtext and reader discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept has originality, the prose sometimes becomes overly dense or self-consciously "literary," and the underlying conflict structure is not entirely novel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ambitious and thematically rich, but undermined by a slightly too-neat resolution and moments where the prose's density or explicit thematic statements hinder full immersion and subtlety.</comment>
