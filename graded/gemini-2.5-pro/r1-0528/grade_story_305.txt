<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives action, but the "reticent" attribute is poorly evidenced, contrasting with her bold engagement with the unknown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong plot progression driven by the "knock" and a clear arc within the word limit; the "sketches" method feels somewhat convenient as an initiating device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative setting and atmosphere are outstanding strengths, creating a vivid and immersive world; the "cake baking" timeframe feels like an extraneous detail that doesn't meaningfully contribute to the core narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and a unique central concept ("gathering of echoes") create strong impact; however, the resolution of "dethroning complacency" is purely internal to the protagonist and lacks broader shown consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story exhibits compelling originality in its core conceit and unusual setting, largely avoiding formulaic pitfalls, though the information delivery via sketches is a minor narrative convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates high creativity in combining disparate elements into a largely cohesive and atmospheric whole, though the "cake baking" timeframe is the least integrated and slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
