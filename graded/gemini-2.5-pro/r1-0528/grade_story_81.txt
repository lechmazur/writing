<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters are functional archetypes; narrator's 'empathy' is more intellectual than deeply personal, limiting profound character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc, but the resolution of 'fracturing reality' via personal epiphany feels thematically convenient, lacking narrative rigor for the initial stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting strongly supports theme; some futuristic terminology ('chroniton,' 'phased silk') feels like superficial genre dressing rather than deeply integrated world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong theme and symbolism; however, meaning is delivered too explicitly through didactic dialogue, reducing potential for subtext and reader discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ornate language occasionally veers into 'purple prose,' and the familiar mentor-epiphany structure diminishes originality; emotional shifts are often stated rather than subtly shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically clear, but reliance on overt exposition and conventional structure limits its claim to groundbreaking literary merit or profound subtlety.</comment>
