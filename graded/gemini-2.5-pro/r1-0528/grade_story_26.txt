<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is largely subservient to the conceptual plot; motivation is clear but lacks deep psychological nuance for Aris beyond the label of "inventor" and "shame-ridden."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves its arc but hinges on a resolution that feels metaphorically convenient rather than deeply wrestling with the complexities of its central problem (shame).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is competent and visually descriptive but relies on standard cyberpunk tropes without forging a uniquely memorable or groundbreaking setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While thematically ambitious, the prose strains for significance, and the direct articulation of abstract concepts like "singularly plural" feels didactic rather than seamlessly woven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The central premise has a spark of originality, but this is undermined by reliance on the "tortured inventor" trope and the self-conscious, direct inclusion of abstract assigned terms, lending an air of artificial construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>A skillful execution of a complex brief, but the seams of its construction and the overt showcasing of its assigned abstract elements prevent it from achieving the seamless, organic quality of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
