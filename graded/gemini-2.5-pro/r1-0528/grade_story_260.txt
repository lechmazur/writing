<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "obsessed cryptic crossword creator" attribute is thematically linked to his method, but the *specifics* of how cryptic crossword skills translate to decoding grief into clues could be more deeply or uniquely demonstrated beyond general pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates a clear mini-arc with effective cause-and-effect; however, the "proliferation" of words, while central, feels somewhat asserted rather than vividly shown in its expansive process before the specific reconciliation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "whisper collection point" and "night with no stars" create a powerfully evocative atmosphere rich in auditory detail; the visual grounding of the collection point itself remains slightly abstract, relying more on sound than sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves strong thematic resonance and uses literary devices effectively, particularly symbolism; however, some descriptive phrases lean towards the ornate, risking a slight heaviness in the otherwise impactful prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High originality in concept and character method successfully avoids major tropes; however, the consistent richness of descriptive language, while often effective, occasionally verges on "purple prose," which a harsh critic might flag as potentially overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its assigned elements into an imaginative and resonant whole; the density of evocative prose, while aiming for literary depth, occasionally prioritizes atmospheric description over the subtlest narrative finesse required for flawless execution.</comment>
