<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent but leans on archetypes; the internal journey and motivation, while clear, are somewhat explicitly stated rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and complete within the tight word limit; the "jiggle" action serves as a recurring motif more than a primary plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly effective synthesis of setting, timeframe, and atmosphere, creating a fittingly mystical and introspective mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic focus and use of symbolism, but impact is lessened by moments of direct thematic exposition ("understanding the importance of trauma").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While generally original in its synthesis, relies on some familiar narrative archetypes and the self-referential use of the assigned tone ("grandiose subtlety") feels slightly artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of numerous elements is a strength, though the explicit flagging of the assigned tone ("grandiose subtlety") within the narration slightly compromises organic storytelling.</comment>
