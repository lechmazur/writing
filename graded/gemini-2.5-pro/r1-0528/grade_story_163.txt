<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "lost heiress" element is underdeveloped and largely a plot convenience for the hacker chip; the character's "bitter optimism" is asserted but lacks profound depth in its portrayal beyond her persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but progression relies on some convenient narrative shortcuts (e.g., hacker chip, easy station access) rather than wholly organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting and cloud migration effectively create a vivid, supportive atmosphere; however, the unique xenobiological details feel somewhat surface-level, not fully exploited to deepen the thematic resonance of fragmentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The parking stub as a symbolic anchor is a notable strength; however, repetitive thematic phrasing ("reckless precision," "bitterly optimistic") and occasionally dense prose detract from subtlety and impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept of resolving fragmented reality via a mundane anchor shows originality; however, the narrative leans on familiar tropes (inherited hacking skills) and the forced repetition of certain phrases feels somewhat artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambitiously integrates many assigned elements into a cohesive structure, but the narrative occasionally feels constrained by them, with some plot points and stylistic choices seeming imposed rather than seamlessly organic.</comment>
