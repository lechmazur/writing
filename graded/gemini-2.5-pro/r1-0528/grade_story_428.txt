<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: The "rarely authentic" attribute compellingly fuels his internal conflict and motivation. Weakness: The "city planner" aspect feels more like backstory than an active counterforce in the climactic decision, muting some potential for deeper internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: The plot forms a clear arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the "debase" action. Weakness: The protagonist's swift trust in esoteric "constellation" data over tangible assets is a significant, somewhat jarring leap for his established meticulous character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: The ancient temple setting is exceptionally well-integrated, its "crumbling apertures" directly serving the plot's "broken constellations" method and enhancing atmosphere. Weakness: Occasional descriptive details (e.g., "apsaras") feel decorative rather than deeply embedded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Rich symbolism (ink blotter, broken stars) and a "terrifying liberation" ending create resonant subtext and emotional impact. Weakness: Some metaphorical language feels overwrought (e.g., "air crackled with daring caution"), slightly undermining the otherwise strong craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strength: The juxtaposition of the orderly ink blotter against the ancient, chaotic unknown offers a spark of originality. Weakness: The core exchange relies on some familiar tropes (shadowy figure, mystical prophecy) and the prose occasionally becomes overly dense, hindering effortless authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Successfully integrates diverse assigned elements into a thematically resonant whole, leaving a lingering sense of unease. Weakness: The story's ambition sometimes leads to prose that feels more effortful than effortlessly "flawless," hindering immediate top-tier publishability without revision.</comment>
