<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Silas's "knack" for interrogating ghosts feels like an unearned plot device rather than organic to his con-artist persona; the swiftness of his emotional turnaround strains credulity for a supposedly hardened character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot coheres but relies on an abrupt introduction of the supernatural method; the causal link between Silas's initial "mild fervor" and the ghost interrogation is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is a significant strength, effectively rendered with sensory details that create a palpable atmosphere of desolation, strongly supporting the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic impact through the ghosts' dialogue, but instances of telling emotion (e.g., "insidious lull...seep") blunt the overall craft, though symbolism is otherwise effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The ghosts' "unusually normal" demeanor and philosophy offer originality, but the broader "flawed protagonist finds redemption via supernatural encounter" framework and rapid change feel somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are integrated into a generally cohesive and thoughtful narrative, but the crucial character ability feels underdeveloped and his transformation, while poignant, is too rapid for highest-tier believability.</comment>
