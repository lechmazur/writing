<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation shift from "weather patterns" to dune threat is logical but initial motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; "tactically reckless" attribute is demonstrated but internal journey to it is rapid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong arc for its length, but the high-concept "giant's book" setting requires perfect execution to overcome potential skepticism in top-tier literary fiction; timeline feels compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a strong atmosphere, but the fantastical setting's integration and some overly lush prose are potential weaknesses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and symbolism present; however, some phrasing verges on clich√©, and the emotional shift to recklessness could be more subtly nuanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original core premise (library, footage analysis) is a strength; weakness lies in prose occasionally risking "purple" density and some familiar "desperate hero" emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ambitious and creative combination of elements; however, the blend of fantastical and gritty realism might not achieve the seamless profundity required for the highest literary echelons without further refinement.</comment>
