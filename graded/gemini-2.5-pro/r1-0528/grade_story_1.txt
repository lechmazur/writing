<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Phobias are compellingly central, but the 'stunt double' profession feels more an ironic frame than deeply integrated into the core conflict's resolution mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc and effective plot progression via the core action; the 'dance on the edge of madness' motivation feels thematically disjoined from the patient, methodical climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is powerfully evoked, making the setting highly effective; the 'salt-crusted net' in a desert pyramid is a vivid but slightly ungrounded detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Achieves thematic depth via its central metaphor; however, reliance on some direct emotional exposition ('a strange calm...settled over me') slightly mutes the narrative impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Core concept offers strong originality, subverting genre tropes; minor lexical repetition ('numb fascination') and a somewhat archetypal motivation slightly dull its innovative edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weaves most assigned elements into a resonant narrative; however, the 'stunt double' identity isn't fully leveraged within the pyramid's central psychological drama to achieve flawless integration.</comment>
