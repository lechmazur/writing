<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character actions are consistent; the 'openly' aspect of the 'openly private' attribute is discernible but its full resonance or distinctiveness could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the assigned action; the pivotal 'affirmation by silence' is well-placed but its direct plot mechanics are swift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The initial setting and timeframe create strong atmospheric contrast; however, 'gentle turmoil' functions more as a described internal state/transition than a pervasive narrative tone from the outset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact and thematic depth through potent imagery and symbolism, though a few poetic expressions lean towards the ornate or familiar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion and creative integration of elements; its stylistic richness is a defining feature but occasionally sacrifices ultimate concision for poetic flourish, preventing flawless execution.</comment>
