<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her role as a dream interpreter; however, her internal complexity beyond "peculiar faith," while fitting, isn't deeply explored, making her more a strong vehicle for the theme than a profoundly nuanced character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable completeness and clear arc within the tight word limit, with the action (calcify) providing a strong climax; pacing is well-managed, and cause-effect relationships are logical and coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, with the vapor collection facility and "baking cycle" being highly original and intrinsically linked to the plot and Elara's actions; sensory details effectively establish a distinct, oppressive, yet strangely vital atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of symbolism (Law Stone, dream-essence) and a powerful central metaphor ("dreams made stone"), leading to a thematically resonant and thought-provoking narrative; the ending is purposeful and impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While largely original, the repeated phrase "occasionally frequent" to describe the pulse is a significant weakness, sounding unnatural and forced, which slightly mars the otherwise strong prose and risks feeling like an artificial constraint awkwardly met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high creativity in combining most elements cohesively; however, the integration of the attribute "occasionally frequent" feels less organic than other elements, slightly detracting from an otherwise seamless and impactful narrative.</comment>
