<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Elara's pragmatism and core motivation ("become a force of nature") are compellingly realized. Weaknesses: The "soothsayer" aspect feels slightly less dynamically integrated into her climactic actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Palpable atmosphere with strong sensory details effectively supports the narrative. Weaknesses: Minor repetition of descriptive terms for the forest ("gnarled," "twisted") slightly mars the vividness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Highly original central concept of a soothsayer-blacksmith manufacturing a miracle via resonant song. Weaknesses: A few common phrasings and some thematic repetition slightly temper complete linguistic novelty.</comment>
