<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is compelling and drives the narrative, but the "trapper" character archetype feels somewhat superficially applied to the space observatory setting, lacking deep integration beyond general resourcefulness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, though the "silently audible wave" phenomenon, while atmospheric, borders on a convenient symbolic underscoring of the internal revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desolate atmosphere of the observatory is potently evoked and strongly supports the character's isolation; the "gritty" aspect of the tone is well-realized, while the "whimsy" feels more asserted at the end than consistently woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of potent central metaphors (sea glass, black hole of doubt) and achieves genuine emotional resonance, particularly in the evolving understanding of loss and hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and avoids AI-like genericism, with fresh metaphorical language and a nuanced emotional progression; the originality shines in the reinterpretation of the "upside of loss."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion, artfully weaving its assigned elements into a poignant narrative that effectively uses its brevity to deliver a lingering emotional and thematic impact.</comment>
