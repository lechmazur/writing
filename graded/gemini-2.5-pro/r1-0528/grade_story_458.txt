<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and linked to the object, but the "spiritually secular" trait feels somewhat expository to justify the method. The character's profound internal shift regarding "preservation" happens very rapidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete and driven by the "obliterate" action. However, the direct interpretation of coffee stains to "obliterate the Atlas" is a narrative contrivance, a leap in logic that feels convenient rather than deeply earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and the setting enhances thematic concerns. The repetition of "fractal sorrow," while evocative, slightly diminishes its impact and points to a minor lack of lexical freshness at a critical emotional beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic depth and uses potent imagery. However, some prose ("spiritually secular existence where meaning was found in patterns, not prayers") is dense and slightly overwrought, and the plot's reliance on the coffee stain interpretation feels less than seamlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding many AI pitfalls and showing a distinct style, the story relies on the somewhat abrupt coffee-stain revelation, which can feel like a narrative shortcut. The repetition of "fractal sorrow" and some overly "writerly" phrases detract from utter naturalness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates many elements, and the core idea is compelling. The brief length is used effectively. The primary weakness is the coffee stain divination feeling more like an imposed constraint than an organic development, slightly undermining the story's overall flawlessness.</comment>
