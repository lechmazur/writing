<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dual motivations (revenge/reflection) feel unevenly developed and weighted; the 'reflection' aspect lacks sufficient depth and integration, reading more like an imposed metaphor than an organic character drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept "harvesting the past" is stated more than organically demonstrated through the plot's unfolding; the resolution via tooth mark analysis feels somewhat convenient within the compressed timeframe of the gondola ride.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The specified tone "cautious enchantment," while present in scenic description, feels slightly dissonant when juxtaposed with the character's grim internal state and the forensic, analytical nature of the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Key symbolism (the dark reflection) is introduced but remains underdeveloped, lacking exploration and thus limiting thematic depth; the narrative achieves competence but misses profound emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the central method (tooth mark analysis) offers originality, some descriptive phrasing ("phantom melody," "sky bruised with dawn") borders on the conventional for atmospheric writing; character reasoning lacks surprising psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The integration of the 'dark reflection' motivation feels less seamless than other elements, slightly weakening overall cohesion; the story is functional but doesn't quite transcend the sum of its required parts to achieve undeniable literary merit.</comment>
