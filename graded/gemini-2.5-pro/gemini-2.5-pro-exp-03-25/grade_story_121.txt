<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits feel somewhat asserted rather than fully embodied; "shifty" lacks demonstration and "traditionally spontaneous" is awkward phrasing detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot relies heavily on backstory and internal reflection rather than present action; assigned 'action' (mineralize) and 'method' (tailing caravans) function as exposition, not plot drivers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere and setting details (drive-in), though the microscope's presence feels slightly overly convenient as a symbol initially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Competent craft with effective imagery (drive-in decay, firefly), but thematic points are occasionally stated too directly ("He saw now that..."), slightly diminishing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids obvious AI pitfalls but lacks a truly distinctive voice or consistently fresh phrasing ("a quality that felt more like a curse") required for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are generally well-integrated thematically, but some (like "traditionally spontaneous") feel more like required inclusions than fully organic components of the narrative.</comment>
