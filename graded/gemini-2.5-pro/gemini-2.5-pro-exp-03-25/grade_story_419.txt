<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'empathic' aspect and motivation are clear and drive the action, but the 'no-nonsense blacksmith' feels more like a label than an integrated character trait; her actions are sensitive and methodical, lacking the described 'no-nonsense' edge or tangible connection to blacksmithing beyond metaphor. The attribute 'steadily free' feels tacked on at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit simple, arc (disturbance -> investigation -> resolution) driven effectively by the 'mollify' action and 'heartbeat' method. It achieves completeness within the word count, but the conflict resolution feels somewhat swift and low-stakes for truly compelling narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dollhouse museum setting, combined with the 'after memory fades' timeframe, creates a unique and evocative atmosphere that strongly supports the concept and character's purpose. Sensory details related to the echo are effective, though the 'practiced spontaneity' tone feels slightly misaligned with the deliberate actions described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes a melancholic, peaceful mood through strong imagery and the unique central concept ('emotional static'). The metaphor of the 'blacksmith of echoes' is memorable, and the theme of enduring emotional resonance is clear. The craft is generally high, showing rather than telling the change in the echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept is original, avoiding major clich√©s. However, some phrasing ("curated stillness," "practiced spontaneity," the slightly forced 'blacksmith' metaphor) feels somewhat self-conscious or overly constructed rather than entirely organic. The emotional handling is adequate but lacks deep nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, integrating most elements effectively into a unique premise. The setting, action, method, and motivation work well together. However, the character description and assigned attribute ('steadily free') feel less seamlessly woven in, slightly weakening the overall synthesis.</comment>
