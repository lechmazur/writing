<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation (preserving traditions) is clear and drives action, but the "sincere rebel" trait feels somewhat asserted rather than deeply demonstrated within the scene. Character voice is indistinct in third-person limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot arc (discovery -> theorize -> internal shift) is present, but the assigned method ("through shared secrets") is poorly realized; whispering to stones doesn't constitute sharing secrets. This weakens the structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere ("braided bitterness," damp, eerie) is effectively established using strong sensory details, enhancing the setting ("haunted secret passage") and timeframe ("between storms"). The sticky note feels slightly anachronistic, slightly weakening the world's cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses imagery and establishes a mood, exploring themes of past vs. present and confronting fear. However, the emotional impact relies partly on stated feelings ("Fear... pricked at her") rather than purely showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the atmosphere is well-rendered, the core setup (rebel, old house, secret) borders on familiar tropes. The sticky note feels like a slightly forced, anachronistic element, and phrases like "deep-seated conviction" are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated reasonably well to create a cohesive mood and theme, but the weak execution of the "shared secrets" method and the slightly jarring nature of the sticky note detract from overall seamlessness.</comment>
