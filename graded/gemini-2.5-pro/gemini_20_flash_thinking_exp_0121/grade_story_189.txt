<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute ("uniquely literal") is asserted but not convincingly demonstrated; its connection to her method of exploiting nuanced anxieties in notes feels contradictory and underdeveloped, weakening the foundation of her portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot structure establishes a scenario but lacks significant progression or a complete arc within the word count; it feels more like static exposition than a dynamic narrative, despite coherent cause-and-effect for the character's immediate actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is effectively established with good sensory details, and the setting/timeframe mesh well; however, the "haunted" aspect feels superficial and doesn't meaningfully impact the character or plot beyond adding slight flavour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story shows potential with its unique combination of elements and some evocative imagery, but suffers from underdeveloped subtext, limited emotional resonance due to the character's detachment, and an over-reliance on telling rather than showing key traits like 'literalness'.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the core concept has originality, the execution relies on some generic phrasing ("thick with the scent," "shaft of light") and repetitive statements of key elements ("grand designs," "brazen calm"). The inconsistent logic surrounding the 'literal' attribute detracts from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion but feels constrained by its elements rather than organically driven by them; the integration of the 'literal' attribute is particularly weak, preventing the piece from achieving a sense of seamlessness or profound depth.</comment>
