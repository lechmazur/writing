<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute "uniquely generic" is asserted but not convincingly demonstrated or explored, remaining superficial. The motivation ("embodiment of values") feels abstract and insufficiently connected to the specific, drastic action of performing a dark ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses from A to B, but the connection between the "method" (discoloration) and the "action" (initiate ritual) lacks clear causal logic, weakening overall coherence. The beginning/end framing with the protest feels tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the graveyard setting and encroaching darkness concept create a baseline mood, the "protest" timeframe feels entirely disconnected and irrelevant to the core narrative events. The specified "flippant solemnity" tone is mentioned but not sustained in the narration, resulting in tonal inconsistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (darkness, transformation), but relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion and internal change. The central conflict (harnessing darkness) is present but resolved too conveniently, lacking profound impact or memorable execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on predictable gothic tropes (haunted setting, dark ritual, mirror) without offering fresh perspectives. The language occasionally veers into purple prose ("cold, comforting embrace," "tangible force"), and the character's internal state feels declared rather than genuinely evoked, bordering on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story feels like an exercise in stitching together disparate elements rather than an organic whole. Several key components (protest timeframe, discoloration method, generic attribute) are poorly integrated, hindering cohesion and making the narrative feel forced and superficial.</comment>
