<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but abstract ("alpha predator called despair"). Key attributes like "seldom odd" and "earnest flippancy" are stated but insufficiently demonstrated through action or voice, remaining superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a discernible arc (inciting incident -> internal reflection -> resolution) within the word count. However, the integration of the 'board game rounds' timeframe feels peripheral and doesn't significantly drive or structure the core emotional journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The 'frost giant's lair' setting is drastically underdeveloped and feels incongruous with the introspective tone and mundane event (party). It adds an unearned fantasy element without leveraging it atmospherically or thematically beyond a basic metaphor for isolation. Sensory details are lacking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling the character's realizations ("She realized that...") rather than showing them organically. Symbolism (rose, lair) is overt and lacks subtlety. While a theme emerges, the overall impact is muted due to weak execution and lack of deep emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative employs clich√©s ("testament to her journey," "badge of honor") and follows a predictable arc of confronting internal struggles via an external social event. The combination of elements feels somewhat arbitrary and lacks a unique authorial style or surprising insight. Emotion is stated more than evoked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story struggles for cohesion, primarily due to the poorly integrated setting which clashes with the psychological focus. Elements feel more like items checked off a list than organically interwoven components serving a unified vision. The narrative doesn't transcend the feeling of being an exercise.</comment>
