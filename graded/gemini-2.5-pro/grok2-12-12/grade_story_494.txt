<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute 'doubtfully confident' is stated repeatedly but poorly demonstrated; the transition from doubt to confidence via humming is abrupt and unconvincing. Motivation is clear but generic; his actions (pacing, humming) feel underdeveloped for a renowned swordsman. The paradox isn't explored, merely asserted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is present (setup, confrontation of doubt, resolution) but feels formulaic and rushed within the word limit. The 'authorize' action is mentioned as backstory but doesn't actively drive the *present* plot. The resolution (song fixing everything instantly) lacks logical buildup and feels overly convenient, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting (calligraphy master's courtyard) provides a potentially interesting contrast but remains underdeveloped, lacking evocative sensory details. The 'faded tapestry' connects symbolically to 'shackled potential' but its sudden glowing is clich√©. The 'harsh tenderness' tone is asserted rather than evoked through atmosphere or nuanced description. 'Between breaths' is mentioned but doesn't meaningfully shape the atmosphere or pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (tapestry, song) but applies it heavy-handedly. The emotional arc is told rather than shown ("his doubt melting away"). The central conflict (internal doubt) is resolved too easily, diminishing impact. The writing style is functional but lacks distinction or depth. The ending feels abrupt and the final phrase "truly doubtfully confident" is awkward and unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on tropes (arrogant warrior with hidden depths, wise mentor). The paradoxical elements ('doubtfully confident', 'harsh tenderness') are handled superficially, suggesting formula over nuance. The sudden, magical resolution (glowing tapestry) feels like a predictable narrative shortcut. Language is sometimes stilted ("harsh tenderness of his resolve was palpable"). Lacks genuine emotional resonance and unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story feels forced to accommodate the assigned elements, particularly the awkward combination of a swordsman, a wedding song, and 'delivering a spark'. The elements often feel listed rather than organically woven. The brevity highlights the underdeveloped plot and character arc rather than feeling like a deliberate stylistic choice. The conclusion is weak.</comment>
