<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'jumpy' attribute feels superficial and inconsistently portrayed; motivation is clear but lacks deep exploration or unique nuance beyond the basic premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the 'echoing footsteps' concept feels more atmospheric than structurally essential, and the paint drip revelation is convenient rather than organically earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but the integration isn't seamless, feeling somewhat constructed around the prompts rather than flowing entirely organically from a central vision.</comment>
