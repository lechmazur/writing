<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'orchardist' background feels arbitrary and poorly connected to the core sci-fi premise; motivation is present but lacks deep grounding or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves a functional arc within the word limit, driven by the 'contain' action, but the setup (orchardist past) feels disconnected from the resolution (seeking more skulls).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The facility setting, 'hush' timeframe, and skull object create a strong, cohesive atmosphere that effectively supports the 'haggard awe' tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts thematic depth regarding memory and morality, uses some evocative imagery, but the prose occasionally becomes overwrought ("lantern of song") and relies too much on stating emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The core concept has originality, but the execution includes slightly purple prose and the phrase "genuinely artificial" feels shoehorned and underdeveloped, hinting at formulaic constraint-filling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to make all assigned elements feel organic; the orchardist background and 'genuinely artificial' attribute weaken overall cohesion despite a compelling central scene.</comment>
