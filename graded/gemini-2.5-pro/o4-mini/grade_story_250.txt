<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'blunt' aspect of the heretic is underdeveloped, almost absent; defiance is shown, but not bluntness. The teddy bear effectively conveys vulnerability, but the character's core assigned trait isn't convincingly portrayed through action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the central method (stock ticker) lacks logical integration within the ancient temple setting, straining coherence. The resolution feels abrupt and overly convenient ("murmurs congratulations").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong, leveraging the temple setting effectively. However, the timeframe description is vague poeticism, and the incongruous stock ticker undermines the world's internal consistency despite evocative sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on its unusual premise for impact. While imagery is used, some emotional states ("anxious elation") are repeatedly stated rather than purely shown. The ending offers resolution but lacks profound depth or subtext beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>High concept originality is hampered by execution. Phrases like "anxious elation" and "enthusiastically cautious" feel slightly unnatural or repetitive. The stock ticker's presence without explanation feels like a potentially formulaic combination rather than organic worldbuilding. Some language borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is significantly strained by the stock ticker element, which feels imposed rather than integral. While the combination of elements is creative, their integration is uneven, suggesting the story serves the elements more than the elements serve a seamless narrative.</comment>
