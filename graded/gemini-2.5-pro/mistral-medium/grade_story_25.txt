<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Mariner's stated motivation ("set reason ablaze...") feels externally imposed and inadequately reconciled with his core drive; "coldly intense" attribute is asserted rather than compellingly demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The link between "analyzing rungs" as a method and "assimilation" as an outcome is tenuous and indirect; the audience's rapid plot arc feels unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The "dusty theater" feels like a jarring, artificial imposition, failing to integrate cohesively with the ultraviolet forest and mariner's immediate reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative frequently defaults to telling its themes (e.g., "price of freedom...was...transformation") rather than consistently showing them through nuanced action or character experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The central theater/audience framework feels highly contrived, leading to an inorganic structure and predictable thematic pronouncements rather than genuine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Several core assigned elements (theater, specific motivation phrasing) are integrated so awkwardly that they feel like narrative burdens rather than organic components, fatally undermining cohesion.</comment>
