<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>General's transformation is evident, but his distinct personal voice is underdeveloped; he functions more as a recipient of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from despair to renewal; the 'hidden equation' element feels like a briefly introduced and underutilized plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly effective; the 'dark matter diner' and 'between rides' timeframe create a uniquely fitting liminal atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphor and imagery, but the ending leans heavily on telling, explicitly stating themes rather than allowing them to emerge fully from the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Concluding paragraphs use repetitive phrasing (e.g., "And the general?") and an overly declarative final sentence, lacking the subtlety expected in top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Creative fusion of elements, yet the narrative's impact is lessened by a denouement that over-explains rather than resonates implicitly, feeling somewhat formulaic in its wrap-up.</comment>
