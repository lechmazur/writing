<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyssa's guilt-driven arc is clear, but the historian is archetypal and the "swordswoman" aspect feels underleveraged within the immediate narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the "gleaning secrets" method is stated rather than compellingly demonstrated, a missed opportunity for tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The neon-shop/tribal-mask juxtaposition offers strong, unique atmosphere, though reliance on "flickering lights" becomes repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (door, mask, guilt-as-compass) and a resonant theme of reckoning are major strengths, though some phrasing could be fresher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept’s reinterpretation provides originality, but the narrative leans on some familiar tropes (enigmatic guide, magical object’s purpose fulfilled) without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a thematically resonant vignette, yet for top-tier publication, it lacks consistent sharpness and depth to feel truly exceptional rather than competently evocative.</comment>
