<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is functional but lacks deep internal complexity; "theoretically rebellious" attribute feels weakly substantiated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot is clear but the magical resolution appears somewhat facile, and "mindful choices" are asserted more than complexly demonstrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric rendering, though some imagery ("ghostly orchard," "burning comet") borders on the conventional for fantastical settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thematic clarity is a strength, yet pivotal moments rely on vague mechanics ("words not his own") and telling over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Some originality in the core mechanism, but overall prose and narrative structure lean on familiar lyrical tropes, lacking consistent, striking novelty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive for its length and aims, but ultimately doesn't achieve the profound originality or flawless execution demanded by top-tier publication.</comment>
