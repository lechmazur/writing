<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "streetwise" attribute is stated but not deeply demonstrated in her interaction with the temple's magic; however, her core motivation as an orphan seeking hope is clear and compellingly drives her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot presents a strong, coherent arc with the "distant echo" concept effectively tracking the curse's transformation; the "theoretically random" nature of the brooch's patterns feels somewhat underdeveloped as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a rich, immersive atmosphere, with the temple setting and cursed object being meaningfully interconnected; the "unwritten calendar" serves its metaphorical purpose well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its strong theme of agency and a purposeful ending; while literary devices are generally well-employed, the single line of mystical dialogue is a familiar trope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative offers a relatively fresh take on hope and curses, subverting simple resolutions; however, it builds upon recognizable fantasy tropes (orphan, cursed item, magical place) which slightly temper its overall originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves its assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically resonant narrative within its brief length, leaving a lingering sense of empowerment, though not all elements carry equal weight.</comment>
