<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "sly" attribute feels superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into behavior; motivation is clear but the personal depth feels somewhat asserted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a small, complete arc; however, the core action "cede secrecy" is more an internal resolution with its full impact projected beyond the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric and supports the story's themes well, but the "oddly usual" attribute feels shoehorned into the sensory details without convincing justification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant mood with some effective symbolism, but often states its thematic points and emotional shifts directly rather than relying purely on showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the repetition of certain key phrases (e.g., "sly agent," "tarnished fork") and the awkward incorporation of "oddly usual" give a slight impression of fulfilling constraints rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is largely cohesive and atmospheric, but a few key assigned elements feel more like impositions than seamlessly integrated aspects, slightly hindering its claim to flawless execution.</comment>
