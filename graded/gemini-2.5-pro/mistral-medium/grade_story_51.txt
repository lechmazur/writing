<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attribute 'rationally subjective' is superficially integrated; character arc relies heavily on an external catalyst for its pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Museum-based method feels somewhat disconnected from the garden-based epiphany; the plot's central resolution feels more incidental to the method than a direct outcome of it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The 'static electricity garden' is exceptionally well-realized and symbolic; other aspects of the world (e.g., museums) are comparatively less vivid or atmospherically developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism and a clear theme are evident, but the pivotal dialogue delivering the thematic message is overly didactic for the highest tier of literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High originality in the core setting and character concept, but the 'rationally subjective' attribute feels artificial, and some emotional/intellectual transitions are rather swift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of elements with a strong central metaphor (the garden/slat), but overall impact is weakened by the inconsistent integration and depth of the assigned character attribute.</comment>
