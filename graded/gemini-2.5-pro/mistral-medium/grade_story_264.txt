<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's 'unruly' trait is under-demonstrated; 'hauntingly cheerful' is present but its 'haunting' aspect feels more asserted than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear arc, but the 'between innings' frame is superficially integrated and the astronomer's conversion is somewhat abrupt for deep-seated cynicism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting provides strong thematic contrast and good sensory details, though the 'between innings' timeframe adds little atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and clear theme are strengths, but some descriptive language ('infinite caution') borders on excessive, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on the 'skeptic converted' trope and some common metaphors ('cynicism like dust'), lacking consistent originality in phrasing or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most elements is a strength, but the superficial use of the 'between innings' element and some predictable narrative turns prevent it from reaching 'flawless'.</comment>
