<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's core motivation is clear and consistent, but the "feral" attribute is underdeveloped, and "effortlessly complicated" is more asserted than demonstrated through current actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear poetic arc and the assigned action (conserve) effectively drives the narrative; however, the "method" (by the sound of a leaf falling) is more symbolic and atmospheric than a practical plot-driving mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong and immersive world-building; the setting and timeframe work seamlessly to create a potent atmosphere that deeply supports the character's motivation and the story's core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolism create significant impact and subtext; however, slight repetition of the phrase "effortlessly complicated" and the pervasive density of the prose could be refined for flawless execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in its premise and a distinct voice; however, the highly ornate prose occasionally borders on "purple," and minor repetitive phrasings (e.g., "effortlessly complicated," "by the sound of a leaf falling") are noticeable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves impressive thematic cohesion despite many specific assigned elements; however, the relentlessly high poetic register, while beautiful, makes the story feel slightly overwrought and lacks some dynamic range for top-tier publication.</comment>
