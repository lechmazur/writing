<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "flawed" attribute is asserted but not deeply explored, limiting full character depth despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot is a coherent vignette, but the assigned "action" (compare) and "method" (organ reverberation) have a tenuous direct mechanical link as plot drivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Core concept offers originality, but execution relies on some familiar poetic phrasing and repetitive thematic statements, reducing overall freshness and feeling somewhat formulaic in expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion and atmosphere are compelling, but stylistic repetitions and a somewhat forced mechanical link between certain assigned elements prevent it from reaching "flawless" execution.</comment>
