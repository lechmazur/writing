<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core trait of seeing ghosts and the motivation for liberation are well-established and drive his internal conflict. However, the "elevator repair technician" aspect (mentioned via "tool belt" and "wrench") is completely incongruous with his depicted work in a "sand castle preservation lab" and feels like an unintegrated, jarring detail. The "elegantly clumsy" attribute is minimally demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from burden to release within the word limit, driven by the ghostly encounter. The initial action ("dissecting stories") sets the scene but isn't the direct catalyst for the climax. Pacing is generally effective, though the initial "staking out ghost tours" feels somewhat disconnected from the lab-centric resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "sand castle preservation lab" is an evocative setting, its fragility and meticulousness mirroring Liam's internal state and the nature of memory. The "dissonance of silence" concept is woven effectively into the atmosphere, evolving with the character. Sensory details are present, though could be sharper in places.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes an emotional response and utilizes symbolism (flower crown, sand) effectively. The theme of letting go is clear and resonant. However, some phrasing ("dissonance of silence," "tapestry of his life") borders on the overly familiar or slightly heavy-handed for top-tier literary fiction. The central conflict is clear and resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the core emotional journey feels genuine, the significant inconsistency of the protagonist's profession (elevator technician vs. sand castle preserver) is a major flaw that feels like a poorly stitched element, potentially indicative of elements forced together. Some metaphors are fresh (glue/ghosts), others lean towards common literary phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is largely cohesive, with most elements serving the central theme of release. The primary exception is the character's profession, which detracts significantly. The brief length feels appropriate for the focused emotional arc. The concept of "dissonance of silence" evolving to "symphony of acceptance" is a strong point.</comment>
