<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "zealous" attribute is inconsistently portrayed, frequently undermined by pervasive doubt without a compelling developmental arc for this contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and the action drives it, but the ultimate "revolution" remains too abstract and its instigation somewhat lacking in immediate, tangible stakes beyond the warrior's internal state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a potent and supportive atmosphere rich with evocative sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and imagery are evident, but the impact is diminished by significant repetition of key thematic phrases and prose that occasionally becomes overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Thematic repetition (e.g., "silent revolution," "whispered legends") and some self-consciously literary or clunky phrasing (e.g., "materially spiritual") detract from freshness and feel formulaic in their insistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While elements are woven together with thematic intent, the narrative doesn't achieve the incisive prose or profound originality expected of "flawless" work, hindered by repetition and a lack of sharpness.</comment>
