<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The "rationally impulsive" attribute is asserted rather than convincingly embodied through action, and the "redemption" motivation appears late and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The core method of "solving cold-case mysteries" is critically absent in execution; the princess's fate is revealed without a discernible investigative process, severely undermining plot coherence and the stated premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the immediate palace atmosphere is evocative, the "post-oil" timeframe feels like a superficial layer, with its specific consequences not meaningfully integrated into the narrative's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ambitious lyricism and a unique concept are present, but the storytelling impact is significantly diminished by an unearned central revelation, which contradicts the pursuit of "honesty" through solved truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>A visionary concept and atmospheric prose are compromised by a fundamental flaw in delivering on its core plot mechanic ("solving"), preventing the story from achieving the flawless execution required for top-tier publication.</comment>
