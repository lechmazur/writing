<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's core motivation and transformation are clear and well-tied to "dry-tongued," but the "gorgeously awkward" attribute, while intriguing, feels somewhat asserted rather than fully, complexly embodied or explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves a concise and coherent arc of transformation, effectively driven by the character's internal journey and interaction with symbolic elements within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the surreal setting and precise timeframe work seamlessly to create a vivid, deeply atmospheric, and thematically resonant world using evocative sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism and imagery creates strong impact and thematic depth, though the relentless poetic richness, while consistent, verges on being slightly overwrought for the highest critical standard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis of surreal elements and fresh metaphors, but the prose, while distinct, maintains a consistently high poetic register that might suggest a stylistic default rather than varied craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and creative piece where assigned elements serve a unified thematic purpose, achieving significant impact, though minor reservations about stylistic uniformity keep it just shy of "flawless."</comment>
