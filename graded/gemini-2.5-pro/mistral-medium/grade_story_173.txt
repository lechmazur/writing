<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent; however, the "kitchen table wisdom" element feels somewhat superficially attached to his otherwise mystical persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot demonstrates a strong, coherent arc with effective pacing and logical cause-and-effect within its fantastical framework, achieving completeness well within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater city hall and multiverse setting are exceptionally evocative, creating a deeply atmospheric and thematically resonant world with good sensory detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Most elements are cohesively integrated into an imaginative narrative; however, the specific phrasing of "kitchen table wisdom" and the overt declaration of the "bittersweet grit" tone are minor detractions from an otherwise polished execution.</comment>
