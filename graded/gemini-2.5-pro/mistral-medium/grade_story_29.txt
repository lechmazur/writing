<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'cleverly' aspect of the 'cleverly naive' attribute is underdeveloped and not convincingly demonstrated in Aldric's actions or insights, weakening the character's core descriptor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete and coherent narrative arc with effective pacing within the tight word limit, though it doesn't transcend conventional structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., "ripe apples and rust," "petals glowing") and the seamless integration of setting with timeframe create a potent, consistent atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance is achieved through effective imagery and symbolism, particularly in its exploration of memory and redemption; the ending is purposeful and thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies somewhat on archetypal elements (knight, maze) and direct emotional exposition (e.g., "agonizing bliss") rather than deeper subversion or purely shown nuance, hindering claims of exceptional originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically resonant whole, largely making the constraints feel purposeful rather than limiting.</comment>
