<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Weakness: Character's profound internal journey ("collision with reality," "patiently frantic") is asserted rather than convincingly developed or shown through nuanced action or thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Weakness: The central mechanism of the bridle acting as a prism to refract lightning is a significant narrative assertion lacking sufficient grounding, weakening the plot's internal logic even for a fantastical premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Weakness: The evocative "sky burial site" setting remains a superficial backdrop, its specific cultural or thematic potential largely untapped; the "during reading" timeframe is very poorly integrated into the narrative's present action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Weakness: The prose frequently strains for profundity (e.g., "refracting his purpose into fractured light"), resulting in overwritten passages that feel self-conscious and detract from genuine impact; key internal states are often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Weakness: Several key descriptive phrases ("euphoric agitation," "patiently frantic") are repeated and feel like self-conscious authorial insertions or keyword fulfillments, lending an artificiality to the style rather than emerging organically from character or situation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Weakness: The story feels conspicuously constructed around its assigned elements rather than flowing organically, leading to a strained and somewhat bombastic narrative that lacks the subtlety and depth expected of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
