<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "energetically lethargic" attribute is unconvincingly portrayed, primarily stated rather than shown, and the character's core motivation ("truth no one dared to handle") feels slightly miscalibrated in its stated grandeur versus its intimate, personal execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the plot achieves a commendable arc and pacing within the word limit, the "invisible allies" concept remains too passive and underdeveloped to significantly shape the narrative beyond a metaphorical flourish for internal guilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is a significant strength, powerfully imagined and integrated, contributing substantially to the story's unique atmosphere and thematic depth; the timeframe element (restarting computer) also frames the narrative effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The craft is generally strong with effective imagery and a purposeful arc leading to a resonant ending; however, the dialogue, while sharp, occasionally borders on the overly aphoristic rather than consistently natural speech.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative largely avoids formulaic pitfalls, showcasing originality in its premise (especially the setting), but certain emotional beats and character dynamics (e.g., the instantly perceptive, wise stranger) lean on familiar archetypes without substantial subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable cohesion and impact despite its brevity and the constraint of assigned elements, but the integration of a few key elements (particularly the character attribute "energetically lethargic") feels less than seamless, preventing it from reaching true flawlessness.</comment>
