<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "literally unique" attribute feels asserted rather than deeply explored through distinctive action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc driven by the "build" action, though the fantastical mechanism of coin-melodies breaking reality remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The core method (coin melodies) offers originality, yet this is undermined by repetitive key phrases ("weight of remembering," "torn pamphlet") and some common similes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere around an intriguing central concept, but the story's reliance on poetic assertion over concrete mechanics slightly weakens its claim to flawless execution.</comment>
