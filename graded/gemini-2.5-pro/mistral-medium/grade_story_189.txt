<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "uniquely literal" attribute is asserted but not meaningfully explored or impactful beyond basic diligence, weakening the character's distinctiveness in crucial moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Key resolutions, particularly the keeper's acquiescence and the protagonist's instant map comprehension, are too swift and convenient, undermining earned tension and depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric creation and thematic resonance through well-chosen sensory details and strong synergy between setting and timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and vivid imagery, but the central epiphany ("She understood now") feels more declared than organically earned by the reader through shown experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original core concept (maps as warning, key as offering) and effective trope subversion, but the frictionless resolution of the spectral conflict lacks deeper human verisimilitude or struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Commendable thematic depth and element integration, particularly the symbolic key, but hampered by the under-exploitation of a defining character trait and an overly convenient climax.</comment>
