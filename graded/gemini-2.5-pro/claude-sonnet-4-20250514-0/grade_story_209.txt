<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, particularly the shift driven by grief and the hairbrush. The "seasoned woodsman" trait grounds his methodical search, but his internal voice, while fitting, could offer slightly deeper nuance beyond the immediate grief and guilt to be truly exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the "short-circuit" action as a goal and "measuring echoes" as a method, achieving a coherent arc from Martha's death to Thomas's acceptance. The concept "freed by honesty" provides a strong emotional climax; however, the fantastical science of "bending reality" is asserted rather than subtly woven, and the final acceptance feels slightly accelerated for the depth of preceding grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" setting, contrasted with the "final beep," creates a potent atmosphere. The "artfully messy" attribute describes the antennae well, contributing to the unique visual. Sensory details are present, though the full unsettling potential of the electromagnetic sanctuary could be further amplified to elevate it from very good to truly haunting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story evokes genuine emotion and employs literary devices effectively (imagery, symbolism of the hairbrush and railways). The theme of acceptance through truth is clear and the ending is purposeful. While the writing style is strong, some phrasing (e.g., "hummed a lullaby") leans slightly sentimental, and the concluding thematic statement is a touch explicit for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative avoids obvious AI pitfalls and blends its core elements with some originality. However, a few similes ("termites in old timber") are somewhat familiar. The emotional arc is largely well-handled, but the swiftness of the final resolution, while fitting the short form, slightly tempers the feeling of profound, hard-won authenticity demanded at the very top tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, skillfully weaving its assigned elements into a poignant narrative that feels deliberate in its brevity. The creative synthesis of technology, nature, grief, and folklore is commendable and leaves a resonant emotional impact. The "artfully messy" attribute feels slightly less integral than other core components.</comment>
