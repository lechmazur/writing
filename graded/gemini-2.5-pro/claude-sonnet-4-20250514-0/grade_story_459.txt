<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels affected and isn't deeply integrated; the character's primary motivation is quickly subsumed by the plot's thematic needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "staking out ghost tours" method is weakly connected to the main plot's resolution; the plot relies on a convenient cascade of crises for its progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic strength of the "sand castle preservation lab" setting is a high point, but reliance on minor clich√©s like "antiquated elevator" slightly weakens an otherwise effective atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thematic statements are somewhat overt for top-tier literary fiction; the repetition of "elegantly clumsy" is a craft misstep, detracting from otherwise competent storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the sandcastle setting offers novelty, the core ghost-helper trope and the neat, somewhat telegraphed epiphany lack surprising originality or deep psychological nuance expected at this level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is thematically cohesive but doesn't achieve "flawless" execution; minor contrivances and stylistic choices (like the "elegantly clumsy" repetition) prevent it from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
