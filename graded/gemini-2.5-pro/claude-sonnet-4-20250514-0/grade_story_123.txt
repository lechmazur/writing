<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's "gleefully morose" attribute is repeatedly stated rather than consistently shown, diminishing its organic feel; Kaine remains somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The "plot" is essentially a static scene; the "sweep" action is incidental, and "through the scuffs..." functions as a passive visual element rather than an active character method for a goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are richly evoked and work cohesively, though the explicit statement of "crisp nostalgia" slightly undermines the otherwise immersive quality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a contemplative mood with some effective imagery, but its impact is lessened by the tendency to "tell" key elements like character attributes and tone, rather than purely "showing" them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The overt, repeated labeling of Mira's attribute ("gleefully morose") and the direct statement of the tone ("crisp nostalgia") suggest adherence to external constraints over organic narrative development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While possessing evocative prose, the story's polish is marred by the somewhat forced integration and explicit declaration of certain assigned elements (attribute, method, tone), preventing a fully seamless narrative.</comment>
