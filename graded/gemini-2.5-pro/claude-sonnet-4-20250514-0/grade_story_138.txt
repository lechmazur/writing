<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and compelling, effectively using the symbolic burning of stubs; however, the "mysteriously obvious pattern" is more stated than organically revealed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lab setting is thematically resonant and enhanced by sensory details; however, the "spontaneous" aspect of the lab feels underdeveloped, limiting full atmospheric immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core setup offers originality by combining disparate elements; however, the repetition of "mysteriously obvious" feels somewhat programmatic rather than entirely organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is largely cohesive and creatively integrates most elements into an engaging narrative; however, it falls just short of "flawless" due to minor stylistic choices and a key deviation from one specified element (reassembly) if external constraints were paramount.</comment>
