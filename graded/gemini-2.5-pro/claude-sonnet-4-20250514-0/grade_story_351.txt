<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's "dreamy poet" aspect and motivation ("to stand by the unremembered") are well-integrated and drive her actions convincingly. However, the "formally rebellious" attribute, while thematically connected to her ultimate purpose, feels more like a stated descriptor of her external life rather than an actively demonstrated trait within the station's core narrative until the very end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc—mystery, investigation, revelation, and resolution—within the tight word limit, with the "delicate undoing" concept providing strong thematic coherence. The action "compel" effectively drives the central discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "disused railway station" setting is exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent atmosphere that perfectly complements the "quietly intense" tone and the story's themes of forgotten lives and hidden truths. Sensory details are evocative and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story powerfully uses symbolism (sundial, pressed flowers, soil from graves) and rich imagery to explore themes of memory and witness, achieving a notable emotional resonance and subtextual depth concerning the ethics of remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the prose is generally lyrical and avoids overt AI-like genericness, the slight repetition of specific descriptive phrases (e.g., "formally rebellious," "quietly intense") risks feeling somewhat self-conscious or like direct adherence to constraints rather than fully organic expression, mildly undercutting complete authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story exhibits strong cohesion, skillfully weaving its assigned elements into a poignant and thematically resonant narrative; the brief length feels like a deliberate artistic choice, enhancing its vignette-like impact and focusing the reader on the power of quiet revelation.</comment>
