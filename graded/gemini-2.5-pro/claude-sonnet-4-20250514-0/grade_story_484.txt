<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Magnus's motivation to embody his values, spurred by his past "uniquely generic" work, is clear and compelling; however, the transformation itself feels more stated than deeply, viscerally earned within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot possesses a clear and satisfying arc from disillusionment to resolved action; the "slightest discoloration" leading to the tower, while functional, feels like a slightly convenient mechanism rather than an organically arising plot point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protest timeframe and mansion setting synergize effectively to build atmosphere and thematic resonance; however, the "encroaching darkness" concept, while fitting, leans on common phrasing, and the "haunted" aspect is primarily atmospheric rather than a dynamic force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of brewing as a central metaphor and symbolic ingredients ("hops for hope"); however, this symbolism, while clear, borders on being overly explicit for the most discerning literary tastes, slightly diminishing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a good degree of originality by combining brewing with themes of rebellion and transformation; yet, it utilizes familiar tropes like the haunted mansion and the artisan-versus-corporation struggle without always subverting them in profoundly novel ways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion with elements generally serving the narrative well, and its brevity feels purposeful; it's a well-crafted piece but doesn't quite introduce a truly groundbreaking element or unforgettable voice that would mark it as exceptional.</comment>
