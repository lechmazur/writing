<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic transformation, but the key attribute 'robustly delicate' and his immediate acceptance of the new calling are more asserted than deeply, internally explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear, coherent arc, but the 'last library card' feels like a thematic overlay rather than an indispensable driver of the core personal plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere supports the mystery, but imagery for Cloud City, while evocative, partially relies on familiar fantasy tropes and could offer more unique sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonant theme of authentic purpose and clever use of past skills for new role, slightly marred by minor clich√©s (e.g., "clung to him like shadows") and a convenient archivist figure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original central premise of scapegoat-to-truth-keeper, though some surrounding plot elements (ancient secrets, cryptic call) are standard genre fare without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and fulfills its premise, but for the highest tier, it lacks truly surprising execution and deep character nuance in pivotal transitional moments; some elements feel more told than shown.</comment>
