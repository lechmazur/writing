<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is stated, but her transformation lacks sufficient psychological depth for a "renowned professional," and the "impersonating" method is superficially developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot's core idea is intriguing, but the pivotal moment of Marina's changing skepticism is rendered incoherent by the misuse of "calcify," severely weakening narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "vapor collection facility" setting and "baking hours" timeframe are highly original and create a strong, immersive atmosphere—a clear strength of the piece.</comment>
