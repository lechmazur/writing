<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The "spontaneous" attribute feels superficially applied rather than deeply embedded in Enkidu's core actions or personality; the "shepherd" aspect is largely incidental to the main events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on a convenient device (coordinates) and features an abrupt spatial transition; the "boast" action serves more as a thematic statement than a dynamic plot-driving event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The palace depths create a suitable atmosphere, but the "ship's maiden voyage" timeframe is under-integrated with the central scene, feeling more like a symbolic frame than an essential component of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Thematic messaging is overly overt, delivered through didactic dialogue which diminishes subtle impact; key emotional and philosophical shifts lean more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from repetitive thematic keywords (e.g., "chaos," "spontaneous") and employs familiar tropes without significant subversion; the "spontaneous" adjective is forced onto multiple concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While attempting to weave elements around a central theme, their integration often feels strained, and the heavy-handed delivery of the message overshadows potential for nuanced storytelling.</comment>
