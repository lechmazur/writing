<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character's "unapologetically timid" trait and "seraphic" appearance are clichéd and superficial; the transformation to "gentle authority" is unearned and overly swift, lacking psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The plot's central mechanism—interpreting a scoreboard as "coordinates for suffering/hope"—is highly contrived and implausible, undermining coherence despite a clear beginning-middle-end structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The reimagined temple setting offers strong symbolic potential, and some sensory details are effective, but the "toxic legacy" lacks palpable grit, and some descriptions ("mournful cry") verge on trope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The story relies on overtly stated themes ("proof that...miracles") and sentimentality over nuanced emotional impact; symbolism is present but often too obvious, and the narrative 'tells' more than it 'shows' transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Significant reliance on clichés ("seraphic appearance," "gentle eyes that see souls") and a predictable "timid heroine finds strength" trope; the scoreboard solution feels artificial, and emotional nuance is sacrificed for sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>While possessing a clear message, the story's execution is marred by an unconvincing central plot device, superficial character development, and clichéd language, failing to meet the standard for high-tier publication.</comment>
