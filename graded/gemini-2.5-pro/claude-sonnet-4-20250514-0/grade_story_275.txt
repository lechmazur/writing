<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The 'theoretically rebellious' attribute feels somewhat underdeveloped or too abstract, lacking concrete manifestation beyond a general non-conformity; the hermit's profound patience and wisdom are more compellingly drawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc, but the 'method' (weathervane angle for translation) feels contrived, acting more as a mystical catalyst for the *outcome* of the translation rather than a plausible means *of* translation itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent evocation of atmosphere; the 'ghostly orchard' and 'burning comet' create a vivid, resonant setting that strongly supports the narrative's tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and imagery contributes to a resonant theme of patience and hidden potential, though the overall narrative impact, while strong, might seek a more unique thematic exploration for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While possessing a lyrical style, the story occasionally relies on familiar phrasing (e.g., "skeletal apple trees," "cradling like scripture") and the 'wise outcast' archetype without sufficiently innovative subversion for top-tier originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and thematically resonant story, elegantly written, though minor contrivances in integrating certain plot mechanics (the weathervane method) and a reliance on some familiar tropes slightly temper its claim to flawless originality.</comment>
