<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya is a functional protagonist whose motivations are clear, but her 'voice' leans towards a professional archetype rather than a deeply unique individual; the vendor's transformation, while key, feels somewhat accelerated for overcoming "deep-seated prejudice" in a single, brief encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a neat arc driven by the 'decay' of prejudice, and the market encounter serves as an effective catalyst. However, the resolution of the vendor's internal conflict feels slightly too swift and tidy for the purported depth of his prejudice, prioritizing thematic conclusion over prolonged psychological exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "unusually usual" juxtaposition of the farmer's market in the abandoned spaceport is evocative and thematically resonant with decay and repurposing. Sensory details are present, though the "ancient novelty" tone could be more deeply suffused rather than pointedly stated at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (phantom punch, decaying hangar) and Maya's dialogue carries thematic weight. However, some pronouncements ("healing takes many forms...") verge on the didactic, slightly diminishing the impact that could be achieved through more subtextual revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt AI-like formulism and blends its unique elements with skill. However, Mayaâ€™s consistent, gentle wisdom and the neatness of the vendor's change, while purposeful, lack the more complex, sometimes contradictory, nuances often found in deeply authentic human interactions and transformations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a thoughtful narrative. While creative, the brevity slightly constrains the full exploration of the prejudice, making the resolution feel efficient rather than profoundly earned through extended struggle.</comment>
