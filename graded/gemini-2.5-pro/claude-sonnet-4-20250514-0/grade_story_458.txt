<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and resonant; the "spiritually secular" attribute feels somewhat functionally applied to enable the plot method rather than being a deeply explored character facet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc and good pacing; however, the coffee-stain divination as the decision's fulcrum feels somewhat arbitrary for the high stakes involved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The depiction of the abandoned spaceport is highly evocative, and strong sensory details effectively establish a melancholic mood; the explicitly stated "fractal sorrow" tone is a minor point of telling over showing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story offers strong thematic depth and potent symbolism (button, libraries); however, some lyrical phrasing ("mathematical poetry," "fractal sorrow") borders on overwrought, slightly diminishing its direct impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "flying libraries" concept brings freshness; however, the core decision mechanism (reading patterns in coffee stains) leans on a familiar trope, and some key descriptive phrases ("fractal") are repeated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative cohesively blends its assigned elements with emotional resonance; its success hinges on accepting the coffee-stain divination, which risks feeling too whimsical for the otherwise serious stakes and themes.</comment>
