<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is strong and clear, but character depth (Zelara) and distinct voice are underdeveloped for top-tier; the artist character is perfunctory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Coherent thematic arc, but plot coherence is weakened by a clich√© "no accident" reveal and a significant deviation from the specifically assigned "method" element ("vacation rental" part was omitted).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully weaves disparate elements into a creative and memorable narrative, showcasing strong thematic cohesion; however, minor imperfections, including the deviation from one constraint, prevent it from reaching "flawless."</comment>
