<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's "shy" attribute, while thematically crucial for the resolution, is more asserted than consistently demonstrated in her earlier actions, feeling somewhat like a label applied retrospectively to unlock the plot rather than a deeply integrated trait from the outset.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent and satisfying arc with a clever core mechanic; however, the "social media algorithm had evolved beyond human comprehension" feels like a convenient enabler for the cross-timeline resolution rather than an organically integrated plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater setting and "echo of regret" create a strong initial atmosphere, but the specified "passionate disinterest" tone is more of a concluding state Maya achieves, rather than a pervasive mood throughout the narrative build-up.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's significant strength lies in its thought-provoking thematic core ("witnessing" vs. "saving") and the impactful, unique resolution, supported by effective use of symbolism like "luminous breadcrumbs."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A notable strength is the story's originality, particularly in subverting the "chosen one" trope by making the solution an act of radical transparency regarding personal failures, avoiding clich√©s and predictable narrative patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates considerable creative thinking and cohesively integrates its core elements into a unique narrative, leaving a lingering thematic resonance; its conciseness feels deliberate and impactful.</comment>
