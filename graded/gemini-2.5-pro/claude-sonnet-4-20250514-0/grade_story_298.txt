<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mei's core motivation is clear, but the "rationally impulsive" attribute is superficially handled, and the pivotal object ("doll's dress") is confusingly introduced, weakening her initial connection to it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on convenient discoveries and a somewhat mystical leap in logic for the revelation, rather than rigorous deduction or purely skill-based reenactment leading to concrete clues. The resolution feels too neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The post-oil, reimagined Chinese palace setting is vividly conceived and "sunlight through debris" is atmospherically potent, representing the story's strongest aspect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the story attempts to explore themes of truth and art, its impact is lessened by a predictable mystery resolution and a tendency to state emotional/intellectual breakthroughs rather than fully dramatizing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The unique blend of sci-fi, mystery, and performance art has originality, but the narrative relies on some convenient tropes and the initial "doll's dress" description is a significant inconsistency that mars the text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The ambitious concept and atmospheric setting show promise, but the narrative is undermined by logical shortcuts, plot conveniences, and a critical textual inconsistency, falling short of top-tier publishability.</comment>
