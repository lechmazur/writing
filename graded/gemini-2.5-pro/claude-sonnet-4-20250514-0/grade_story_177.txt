<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but character depth beyond the "rebellious" attribute is limited; "traveler" aspect feels superficial. Lacks a truly distinct internal 'voice' despite strong actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically, but discovery of key elements (mask, specific tome, chamber) feels overly convenient. "Labyrinth of choices" is more symbolic than an active plot device. The revolution below is largely disconnected from the core mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and evocative, particularly within the library and hidden chamber. However, the "rumors of revolution" timeframe feels tacked on, offering thematic resonance but not meaningfully interacting with or influencing the character's direct actions or the unfolding necromancy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and a unique central concept. However, repetition of key phrases ("lucid frenzy," "humming resonance") and some slightly overwrought descriptions (e.g., "metallic leviathan") detract from flawless execution. The ending is thematically impactful but somewhat telegraphed by the premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly original premise concerning theatrical necromancy. However, the prose is consistently dense and ornate, occasionally straying into "purple" territory which can feel self-conscious rather than effortlessly brilliant. While not AI-formulaic, this intense stylization itself becomes a noticeable pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Creative integration of most assigned elements into a cohesive vision. However, the pervasive stylistic density and minor plot conveniences (especially the ease of finding crucial items) prevent it from feeling "flawless." The revolution element feels underdeveloped and somewhat extraneous.</comment>
