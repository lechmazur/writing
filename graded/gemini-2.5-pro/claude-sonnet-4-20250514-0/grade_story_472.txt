<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "renegade" label feels somewhat unearned by this specific scene's actions, relying more on assertion than demonstration of active rebellion against the Council.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the assigned "lament" action is a passive internal step rather than the primary, active plot driver; the subsequent investigation is more dynamic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and imaginative vignette, achieving a strong sense of purpose and leaving a resonant thematic impression. (Strength)</comment>
