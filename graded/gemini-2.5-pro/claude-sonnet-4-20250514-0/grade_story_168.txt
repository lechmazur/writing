<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong structural arc, but the central mechanism of espionage (predicting future floral designs via ancient symbols) significantly strains logical coherence, even for fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves its disparate elements into an inventive and memorable narrative, showcasing creative synthesis despite some logical leaps in the premise.</comment>
