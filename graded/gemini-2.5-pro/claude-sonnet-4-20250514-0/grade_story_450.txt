<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's core traits (dancer, linguistically inept) are pivotal and create a compelling internal conflict resolved through her unique skill-set; motivation is clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tight, coherent plot structure with a clear arc from problem to innovative resolution, effectively paced within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and impactful storytelling with effective use of symbolism, slightly weakened by an instance of directly stating an emotion ("matched her saturated ambivalence perfectly") rather than purely showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High originality in the central concept's execution (dancing a prophecy) and the subversion of the "chosen one" trope; metaphors are largely fresh and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and creative integration of disparate elements into a thought-provoking narrative that feels complete and purposeful, leaving a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
