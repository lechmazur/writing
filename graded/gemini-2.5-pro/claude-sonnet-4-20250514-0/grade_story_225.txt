<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "apothecary" aspect is underdeveloped and feels extraneous to her role as a lepidopteran theorist. Morrison's romantic motivation, while clear, emerges with a swiftness that sacrifices some depth. Voices are functional rather than striking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The central reveal of months-long coded messages strains credulity regarding Elara's observational skills. While the arc is complete for its length, this key plot point feels somewhat convenient rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "steampunk" elements are present (brass, steam) but largely serve as set dressing rather than deeply influencing the world's mechanics or the narrative beyond aesthetics. The underwater atmosphere is well-evoked, though.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The unique premise (butterfly Morse code) is highly compelling and imagery is often vivid. However, thematic declarations ("beautifully, impossibly whole") can feel overly explicit, slightly undermining the subtlety desired at the highest literary level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept is strikingly original, the prose occasionally becomes overly ornate (e.g., "electromagnetic whispers through the dark water"), and the underlying romantic arc follows a somewhat familiar trajectory for exiled individuals finding solace, despite the novel dressing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is inventive and weaves its elements together with notable creativity. However, for publication where only "flawless" work succeeds, minor inconsistencies in character depth and a tendency towards somewhat florid prose prevent it from reaching that ultimate tier.</comment>
