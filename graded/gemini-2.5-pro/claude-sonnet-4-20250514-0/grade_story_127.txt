<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus's creative block and Helena's desperation are palpable, but the rapid shift from "sworn enemy" to partner, and the swift unblocking of deep trauma, feels somewhat underdeveloped for the profound changes implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven by Helena's calls. However, the "leak" as the primary catalyst for Helena's confession feels like an external convenience rather than a purely character-driven evolution, slightly undermining the plot's organic unfolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is vividly rendered with good sensory details ("dim copper light," "clockwork symphony"), creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting occasionally feels more like an aesthetic backdrop than an element intrinsically woven into the core human drama of betrayal and artistic rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (coral, gauntlet) effectively to underscore its themes. However, the explicit stating of thematic conclusions ("Trust, like coral...") diminishes its literary subtlety, telling rather than allowing the reader to fully infer the deeper meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The fusion of steampunk with coral-inspired biomechanics presents a fresh combination. However, the narrative relies on some familiar tropes (betrayal/redemption, creative block) and a few common phrases ("tumblers falling into place") without always subverting them in a truly innovative way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates good cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a coherent narrative, especially the central motif of coral. Yet, for the highest echelon, the resolution feels somewhat too neat and the thematic delivery too direct to achieve profound, lingering resonance.</comment>
