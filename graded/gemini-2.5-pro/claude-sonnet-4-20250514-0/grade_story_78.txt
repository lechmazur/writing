<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's transformation is compelling, but the philosophical leap ("architecture of cosmic balance") feels slightly incongruous with the otherwise grounded "impostor" groundskeeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "retrieve stolen goods" plot is serviceable but familiar; "coerce" serves as backstory rather than the scene's driving action against raiders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere, but the assigned "timeframe" is a momentary metaphor, not the narrative's structural temporal setting, a slight misapplication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The gardener-as-savior is a fresh character, but the plot relies heavily on common post-apocalyptic tropes (raiders, stolen supplies).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High writing quality and a strong central character are undercut by reliance on some genre conventions and less-than-foundational integration of certain assigned elements.</comment>
