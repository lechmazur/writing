<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the agoraphobia is well-established, the swiftness of her internal "crack" and resolution, while thematically fitting, slightly undercuts the stated "insurmountable" nature of her long-standing condition for a truly deep character study.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot provides a clear and satisfying arc for a short piece, with the catalyst effectively triggering the climax and resolution; however, the ease of overcoming a profound, long-term condition feels somewhat expedited for the highest literary standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "whispering dunes" and storm create a potent, thematically resonant atmosphere, powerfully externalizing the character's internal state and journey; this integration is a significant strength.</comment>
