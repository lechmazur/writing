<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's stoicism effectively serves as a mask, contrasting well with clear internal motivation and defiant actions; the narrative voice possesses distinct cynicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc and effective pacing achieved within the tight word limit; the specified 'method' (encrypted labels) serves primarily as essential backstory rather than the means for the climactic action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (cloying apples, hum, rot/bloom) and a strong connection between setting, object, and theme create a palpable, immersive atmosphere perfectly supporting the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent use of central symbolism (cameo, seeds, cracks) and resonant themes of conformity vs. rebellion, conveyed effectively through 'showing' rather than telling; the ending is purposeful and thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Largely fresh language and strong metaphors avoid clich√©s; the phrase "honestly rare" feels like a deliberate, if slightly unusual, stylistic choice contributing to a unique voice rather than formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Successfully integrates the assigned elements into a cohesive and resonant whole, feeling deliberate and impactful despite brevity; the story uses the elements organically.</comment>
