<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but lacks depth; the 'clumsily dexterous' attribute feels somewhat imposed and explicitly stated rather than seamlessly demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong arc for the word count, but the climax resolution (mob dispersing after fog obscures images) feels slightly convenient/abrupt given their initial intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is potent, but the conceptual link between 'witch's cauldron room' and 'cathedral glass' feels slightly unexplored; the 'chalkboard hush' timeframe integration is more metaphorical than concrete.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impressive use of imagery and original concept, but the density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwrought, slightly hindering clarity and flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly original core concept, but the stylistic effort towards poetic density sometimes feels self-conscious, and minor repetitions ('clumsy dexterity') detract slightly from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are generally well-integrated into a cohesive, memorable vignette, but minor weaknesses in character nuance and plot resolution prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
