<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (sister's legacy, failed chronicling), linking the archer role to his regret (arrows falling short). However, the "anxiously calm" attribute feels more asserted than consistently demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought beyond specific moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the 'confront' action via the 'unplanned stop' at the 'bridge of regret'. It achieves a clear arc (arrival, crisis, catharsis, resolution) within the word limit, though the final sign reveal feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The surreal setting (inverted waterfall, celestial dance) creates a potent atmosphere of otherworldliness and introspection, strongly supporting the 'bridge of regret' concept. However, the specified 'passionate disinterest' tone feels largely absent, replaced by intense regret and eventual catharsis, creating a mismatch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, bridge, waterfall, bow/pen) and evocative imagery creates significant impact and subtext regarding regret, legacy, and action vs. documentation. The central conflict is clear and resolved thematically, leaving a resonant message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the core concept combination is original, the prose occasionally verges on overly ornate ("celestial bodies," "rupture of natural order," "impossible, radiant act"), bordering on purple prose. Emotions are sometimes stated directly ("anxiously calm," "disappointment") rather than purely shown through nuanced action or internalisation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story largely succeeds in integrating its disparate elements into a cohesive, albeit heightened, narrative. The fantastical elements serve the internal character arc effectively, and the brief length feels appropriate for capturing a pivotal moment of transformation.</comment>
