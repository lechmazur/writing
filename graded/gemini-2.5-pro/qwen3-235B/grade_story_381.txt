<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character concept is intriguing (necromancer + baseball cap + old movies), but the 'hushed' attribute feels somewhat underdeveloped. Motivation shifts from mapping to finding the Heart, which is clear, but the connection between the love for old movies and the core method of achieving the goal (necromancy/mapping) feels more atmospheric than functional. The cap sacrifice is a strong character moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from mapping to seeking the Heart of Glass within the tight word count, achieving a reasonable arc. However, the assigned method ('shared love for old movies') serves more as character/atmosphere enrichment than a direct driver of the main plot action (finding the Heart). The 'dominate' action is cleverly reinterpreted thematically. Pacing is generally well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly realized and effectively integrated with the necromancy and the Heart of Glass concept. The 'futuristic nostalgia' tone is distinct and well-supported by details like the holoscreen, automaton, old movies, and cap. Scarcity enhances tension effectively. Sensory details related to light, sound, and the cave's atmosphere are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong emotional resonance through its focus on memory, loss, and remembrance. Imagery (Heart of Glass, projector light) and symbolism (cap, movies) are effectively employed. The theme of preserving memory against oblivion is clear and well-supported. The ending feels purposeful, though the final line leans slightly towards explicitly stating the theme rather than purely showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept blends disparate elements (necromancy, sci-fi, classic film) with considerable originality, avoiding many genre clich√©s. The language is generally evocative, though phrases like "sound of resolve" verge on being slightly abstract or overly conceptualized. Character reasoning feels sufficiently nuanced, particularly the final sacrifice. Doesn't feel overtly formulaic or AI-like.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates numerous, potentially conflicting elements into a cohesive and atmospheric whole. The elements largely serve the narrative and theme, particularly the setting, object, and core character concept. The brevity works, lending focus to the central theme of memory and legacy. It leaves a lingering, melancholic impression.</comment>
