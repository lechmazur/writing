<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The descriptor "mildly curious" clashes significantly with the inventor's obsessive dedication and the profound nature of her quest, undermining character consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and effectively uses the core action ('resonate'), but the rapid sequence of supernatural events feels slightly condensed and reliant on thematic resonance over clear causality within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally strong and evocative, masterfully using the graveyard setting and sensory details; the integration of the 'timeframe' element is slightly more abstract/thematic than literal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Demonstrates impressive literary craft through potent imagery, symbolism, and thematic depth ('showing not telling'), though the sheer density of ideas and lyrical language borders on overwhelming for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original combination of elements and avoids obvious clich√©s; the ambitious, elevated prose largely succeeds but occasionally risks 'purple prose,' preventing absolute flawlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesive and creative, effectively weaving disparate elements into a resonant narrative; minor inconsistencies (character descriptor) and stylistic intensity slightly detract from perfection demanded for top-tier publication.</comment>
