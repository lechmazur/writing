<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's core motivation (burden of leadership, desire to escape fate/consequences) is clear and drives her actions, but the 'calculatedly unpredictable' attribute feels more asserted than demonstrated through a range of behaviours beyond pruning and coded messages.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a surprisingly complete arc within the word limit, using the 'pruning' action effectively as both literal action and metaphor; however, the 'hidden disclaimers in brochures' method feels somewhat secondary to the core conflict and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized and strongly contributes to the bittersweet, decaying atmosphere; the juxtaposition of the orchard and solar panels is potent, though the 'workshops' timeframe feels slightly underutilized as a grounding element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pruning, maps, disclaimers, dying trees) and evocative imagery creates significant impact and subtext; the central conflict and theme resonate strongly, achieving depth despite brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong and avoids obvious AI tells, featuring fresh metaphors (guilt/sap); however, the sheer density of metaphors and thematic statements occasionally borders on feeling overworked or slightly 'purple', lacking the final polish of absolute naturalness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, weaving most elements effectively into a meaningful narrative; while a few elements feel less central than others, the overall effect is purposeful and leaves a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
