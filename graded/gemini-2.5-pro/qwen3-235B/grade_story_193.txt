<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prince's motivation (cure loneliness) is stated but his transformation relies heavily on the magical object rather than a deeply explored internal arc. The 'unintentionally iconic' attribute feels applied rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent (quest, discovery, resolution) and the action 'improve' drives the climax. However, the core method ('chance encounter' via snowstorm) is weakly executed; he intentionally seeks the office, making the 'chance' aspect illogical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting (abandoned customs office, blizzard) and atmosphere are strongly realised and effectively enhance the themes of isolation, memory, and decay. Sensory details are well-employed to create mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (mortar, key, thaw) is potent and the theme of internal reconciliation over external power is clear. However, the prose occasionally strains for effect ("howled like a scorned lover"), bordering on overwrought, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on the 'magical object solves internal problem' trope. Some phrasing feels overly stylized ("alchemy of small redemptions," "dawn bled gold") rather than truly original. The rapid emotional resolution feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Most elements integrate serviceably, particularly the object and setting. However, the forced inclusion of 'unintentionally iconic' and the misaligned 'chance encounter' method weaken overall cohesion. The brevity feels appropriate for the focused arc.</comment>
