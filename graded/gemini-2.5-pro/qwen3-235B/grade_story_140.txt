<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation (lost child, denied fate) is clear but archetypal; the "tortured" aspect feels more stated than deeply explored within the tight narrative. The shift to "playful seriousness" isn't fully convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Achieves a cyclical arc effectively within the word count, but the planetarium backstory trigger feels slightly abrupt and expository rather than seamlessly integrated. Pacing is rapid, borderline rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation through evocative setting details (fractured skylights, faded posters) and the recurring "dawn's second breath" timeframe. Setting and object are well-linked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious use of imagery and symbolism creates impact, but the language occasionally borders on overwrought ("sweet rot blossomed," "tide of teeth and starlight"), slightly undermining the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on recognizable dark fantasy tropes (cursed object, gateway, shadowy void) without significant subversion. Language strives for originality but sometimes uses familiar constructions or overly ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are incorporated, achieving reasonable cohesion, but the integration isn't flawless (especially the planetarium backstory). The story feels purposeful but doesn't quite reach the level of inevitable artistic unity required for the highest tier.</comment>
