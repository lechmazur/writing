<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (dutiful defiance to mend community), but Mabel remains somewhat archetypal, lacking deep, surprising nuance within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on the unexplained magical realism of the bulletins; the ending feels abrupt and the arrival of strangers is symbolically convenient rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively rendered, but the central 'amber prison' metaphor isn't explored with ultimate subtlety, and the 'throughout cooking' timeframe feels underutilized and incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery is present (toy ear, prison), but some similes verge on the familiar ("meat hooks"); subtext exists but lacks profound, multi-layered depth required for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept has originality, but the 'small town with a dark secret/pact' feels somewhat tropey; the prose is capable but lacks a consistently distinctive or dazzling voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion but feels somewhat constrained by fitting the required elements, particularly the timeframe, preventing it from feeling entirely seamless or inevitable.</comment>
