<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and linked powerfully to the wife/daughter/honesty concept, but the 'seasoned woodsman' trait feels slightly underutilized beyond placing him competently in the setting; his core struggle is internal rather than tied specifically to woodcraft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a strong emotional arc within the word count, but the connection between the *method* (measuring echo) and the *discovery* (map via hairbrush snag) feels slightly coincidental rather than directly causal, weakening the structural logic despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The 'radio wave garden' setting is highly original and atmospheric, effectively meshing with the timeframe and themes of memory/loss/signals. Sensory details are present, though the 'artfully messy' attribute could be woven more deeply into the function of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic weight (hairbrush, echo, garden) and evocative language create significant impact and subtext. The theme of truth and penance is clear, though the final transformation into an 'echo' feels slightly abrupt and abstract, potentially lessening the emotional payoff for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids clich√©s and generic phrasing, demonstrating originality in concept and setting. While the style is distinct, phrases like "short-circuited his logic" verge on explicitly stating the theme, and the final symbolic transformation risks feeling slightly predictable within a literary context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates disparate elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole. The ambition is clear and mostly realized, achieving depth despite brevity. Minor weaknesses in plot mechanics prevent a higher score for immediate publishability in a top journal.</comment>
