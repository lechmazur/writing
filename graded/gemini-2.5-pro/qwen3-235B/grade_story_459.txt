<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's ghost-seeing ability and motivation are clear, but the 'elegantly clumsy' attribute feels underdeveloped beyond one anecdote, not consistently woven into their actions or problem-solving within this specific narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient and achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit. The connection between research (staking out tours/dissecting hauntings) and the specific resolution is logical, though the discovery of the lab feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting is strikingly original and effectively contrasts decay with sterile preservation, strongly enhancing the story's atmosphere and thematic concerns. Sensory details are well-chosen and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crown, sand castle) and evocative language creates emotional resonance. The theme of letting go versus preservation is clear and effectively explored, leading to a purposeful ending. Shows, doesn't just tell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While possessing some unique elements (sand castle lab), the core trope of a ghost tethered by an object needing release is familiar. The prose avoids obvious AI pitfalls but occasionally leans towards slightly overwrought phrasing ("dissonance of silence," "oceanic decay").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its core components into a cohesive and resonant narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, concentrating the emotional impact. The elements serve the story well, particularly the setting and object.</comment>
