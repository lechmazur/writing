<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation (atonement for coal plant) feels somewhat grafted onto the cosmic plot rather than organically arising from it; the sheriff archetype itself adds little specific value to this particular narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Achieves a clear arc (setup, confrontation, resolution) remarkably well within the word limit; the fantastical cause-and-effect holds internal logic, though the pacing necessarily feels rapid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "scientific poetry library" and "midday lull" create a distinct and compelling atmosphere, strongly enhanced by evocative sensory details and the "ethereally physical" descriptor, supporting the mystical plot elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of evocative imagery and symbolism (chain, library, meteorite, averted star) creates significant impact and subtext regarding fate and redemption; effectively 'shows' the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Successfully integrates most elements into a cohesive, atmospheric whole, using the constraints to create a focused, impactful vignette that lingers with the reader.</comment>
