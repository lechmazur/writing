<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is sharp and believably escalates from professional curiosity to a personal quest. Her interiority is well-rendered through embodied sensations, particularly the synesthetic translation of the environment. The change at the end is earned, as she takes on the emotional weight of the discovered truth. The man functions effectively as the catalyst for the final revelation, though he is more of a thematic endpoint than a fully realized character, which is acceptable for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain: discovery, motivation, action, struggle, and resolution. The chosen Causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the close. The ending provides a clear Decisive Change in knowledge and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose, with the felt cost being the emotional burden she now carries and integrates into her work, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and integral, with the "cavernous graveyard of starship skeletons" providing a perfect atmosphere for emotional archaeology. The micro-setting of the workbench and the key object—the green glass shard—are not just props but the very engine of the plot. The shard functions as a tool that constrains choice (by dictating the method) and directly charges the final image (the green sigil), fulfilling the requirement for an exceptional score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is established immediately and held throughout. Pressure escalates effectively through Elara's repeated, frustrating jumps and her "frayed" mental state, culminating in a final, desperate attempt. This deepening is driven by her agency, and the resolution comes with a clear, felt cost: the shared burden of regret. The conflict is primarily internal but is dramatized through external action, making the stakes tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory, regret, and the weight of small failures emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The story handles this with subtlety until the final sentence, which veers into overt moralizing. The line "...a reminder that some maps chart territories of the soul, and that the deepest repairs are not made on ships, but in the silent dockyards of the heart" is a clear instance of "Thematic Echo," stating the theme directly and thus weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion. This required a significant deduction per the rubric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that deepens with emotional intensity. The voice is distinct and literary, with a strong perceptual signature evident in phrases like "cartographer of the intangible" and "whispers of rust and ozone." The brief dialogue is purposeful and character-revealing, particularly the man's weary acceptance. The prose as a whole reflects the protagonist's precise, sensory-focused mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Word choice is largely precise and evocative. There is a slight, noticeable repetition of key words like "weight" and "withheld truth" that borders on a conceptual loop, though it could be argued as a motif. The primary flaw is the final sentence, which feels overwritten and less potent than the image of the sigil it follows, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of a "sensory map maker" is fresh and compelling, offering a unique lens for a story about memory and regret. The story synthesizes sci-fi concepts (parallel universes) with a deeply human emotional core, transforming potential genre tropes into a tool for character-driven discovery. The quiet, personal nature of the ultimate "truth" provides a non-obvious and powerful resolution, avoiding a more conventional sci-fi climax.</comment>
