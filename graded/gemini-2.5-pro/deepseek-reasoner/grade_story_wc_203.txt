<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. The characterization is effective, particularly the concept of his skill as a "weightless burden" which is paid off in the final line. However, his interiority, while present, relies on well-crafted labels rather than deeply embodied or contradictory impulses in the moment of discovery; the solemn duty feels a bit too smooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens; every discovery logically follows from the last. The closure—a Decisive Change for the ghost and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Leo—lands with satisfying emotional cost and release. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, demonstrating exemplary control of a single, continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is superb, with sensory details like "dust, soft as powdered sugar" creating a potent sense of decay and forgotten time. Crucially, the setting is not merely descriptive; the water-stained plaster medallion is a plot device that constrains the action, and the dust-free semicircle on the sill becomes a recurring object that powerfully charges the story's final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving the ghost's unrest—is established early and tested throughout the scene. Pressure tightens effectively when Leo understands the problem is not mechanical but historical ("This was not about an elevator"). The resolution is driven entirely by his agency, and the lifting of his "weightless burden" makes the cost and its subsequent relief palpable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of resolving past tragedies and giving voice to the silenced emerges organically from the plot. The central metaphor of discovering "what ceilings hide" is executed both literally and thematically without ever being overtly stated as a moral. The final image of the ghost finding peace offers a resonant, non-verbal answer to the story's central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances Leo's professional detachment with his supernatural sensitivity. The voice has a distinct, melancholic competence. The perceptual signature is strong, seamlessly blending the technician's eye for physical flaws with the seer's perception of emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, a few minor blemishes, like the slightly clichéd phrase "The pieces clicked into place" and the too-direct summary "The secret had killed her," momentarily flatten the otherwise sharp execution. These are small flaws but prevent an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While the "psychic repairman" is a recognizable trope, the story elevates it through a specific and ingenious synthesis of elements. Combining an elevator technician with the forgotten history of a theater's orchestral machine feels fresh and particular. The originality lies not in a radical premise but in the quiet, confident execution of its unique details.</comment>
