<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is very strong, with clear motivation rooted in loss and a palpable tension between grief and hope. Elara's interiority is compelling, and her non-verbal interaction with Kaelen is handled with subtlety and power. The story avoids sentimentality, earning its emotional weight. The only minor friction is the occasional use of abstract emotional summaries, which can feel slightly more authorial than character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is impeccably structured under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a single, decisive moment. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (an Earned Stasis), where the war's end creates a new, difficult reality, and the cost is made explicit and felt in the final lines, fully satisfying the prompt's highest standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the story. The "ancient terrace" and the "scarred, resilient valley" perfectly embody the central theme of flawed beauty. The celestial alignment functions as a critical environmental constraint, while the clipboard acts as a powerful micro-setting, making the environment indispensable to the plot and its resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story establishes a single, high-stakes conflict and escalates pressure effectively through the time constraint of the celestial alignment. The central turn—the ritual itself—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses all other options. The cost of their choice is not just stated but deeply felt in the final, quiet moments, making the peace they achieve both meaningful and fragile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thematic integration is exceptional, with the concept of flawed beauty woven into every element, from the setting to the characters to the nature of the peace itself. The story uses subtext and imagery masterfully, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central questions. It achieves a profound emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and maintains a consistent elegiac tone that perfectly suits the material. The close third-person POV is controlled and effective. The prose rhythm and elevated diction create a mythic quality. A slight, consistent drift into a more abstract, analytical register for emotional states is the only element that marginally reduces immediacy, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished, lyrical, and demonstrates high-level craft, with powerful, concise imagery ("lattice of truce written in starfire"). There are no technical errors or momentum-dulling loops. However, a few key emotional descriptions lean on abstraction ("a compound interest of grief...") rather than embodied detail, a minor but notable instance of telling over showing that slightly mutes the impact of peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant ingenuity by blending sci-fi/fantasy ritual with the grounded, psychological reality of post-conflict trauma. The core conceit of an astronomically-ratified treaty is fresh and memorable. By focusing on the somber, difficult beginning of peace rather than a triumphant end to war, the story subverts expectations and achieves a powerful, authentic vision.</comment>
