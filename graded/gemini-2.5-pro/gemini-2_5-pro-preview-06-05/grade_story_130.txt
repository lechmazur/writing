<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's key attribute "privately open" feels more asserted than deeply demonstrated; his arc relies on a somewhat conveniently timed epiphany rather than a more profoundly explored internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the critical "reverse-engineering" process leading to profound insight is insufficiently detailed, making the resolution feel slightly unearned and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "interstellar orchard ship" offers a unique, atmospheric setting with evocative details, though its deeper implications and unique mechanics remain somewhat peripheral to Kael's internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of central symbolism (nest, phone), but the delivery of theme and emotional shifts occasionally relies on direct statements (e.g., "His motivation shifted") rather than consistently evocative showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core emotional journey, while presented with unique sci-fi trappings, follows a familiar "redemption arc," and certain phrases ("familiar sting," "perfection is a cage") lean on commonplace literary expressions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are woven together with considerable skill into a poignant narrative, but the piece narrowly misses top-tier publishability due to moments of narrative convenience and thematic over-explicitness.</comment>
