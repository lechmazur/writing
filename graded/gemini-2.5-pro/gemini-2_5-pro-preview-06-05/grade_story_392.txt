<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "conjurer" label feels more stylistic than deeply integrated into her character's accessible inner life or unique capabilities beyond the described method; skepticism is well-handled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central conflict's resolution, while thematically resonant, feels somewhat conveniently achieved; the "impossible" storm succumbs rather readily once the correct archival vein is tapped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A highly imaginative and poignant vignette that successfully integrates its core elements, though minor points in character depth and plot inevitability keep it from flawless execution for the highest tier.</comment>
