<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation (disrupt tradition, alleviate suffering fueled by past guilt) is clear and compelling, and his cynical voice is distinct. However, the "goldfish therapist" aspect, while unique, feels somewhat peripheral to his actions and expertise displayed in this specific interaction, which leans more on his past medic life. The "tentatively" in "tentatively fierce" is also less demonstrated than the "fierce."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc (problem, intervention, tentative hope) effectively within the word limit. The action (alleviate) drives the narrative, and cause/effect is logical. The weather initiating the encounter is a slightly convenient device but serves its purpose for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "forgotten recipe library" setting is vividly evoked and intrinsically linked to the plot and Alistair's mission. Atmospheric details are strong (dust, storm, "ghosts of bad cooking"), effectively supporting the tone and character's motivation. The timeframe adds fitting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story offers a unique perspective and memorable character, employing effective imagery and symbolism (toy soldier, serpent). It evokes hope and prompts thought on tradition vs. progress. The dialogue is sharp and the ending, while open, is satisfyingly resonant for a short piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise is original, and Alistair's character largely subverts tropes. Language is generally fresh ("peer pressure from dead people"). However, some phrases like "playful cynicism honed over centuries" are a touch explicit. The storm catalyst is a common trope, albeit reasonably deployed here.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with most elements serving the narrative well. The creative combination of reincarnation, historical guilt, and a fight against medical dogma is compelling. It leaves a lingering sense of hope and reflection on past burdens, showcasing depth despite its brevity.</comment>
