<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation to shed his "forgotten noble" past is clear and effectively drives his actions; however, the "grand, beautiful lies" informing this past remain somewhat abstract, lacking specific grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot coherently builds to a thematically resonant climax, effectively driven by the character's internal decision; the symbolic "fortification" is central and functions well within this allegorical structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "spontaneous combustion lab" is a powerfully realized setting, creating palpable tension that mirrors internal states, though the "mysteriously obvious" descriptor for its danger is a slightly self-conscious literary flourish.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a potent thematic statement through strong symbolism and evocative imagery; the final articulation of Alistair's emotional state, while clear, verges on being overly explicit rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the ticket-stub wall is highly original and deftly executed, elevating the narrative beyond familiar tropes of regret and destructive reinvention with a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates skilled integration of its assigned elements into a cohesive and impactful vignette, achieving considerable thematic depth and a lingering emotional resonance within its brief scope.</comment>
