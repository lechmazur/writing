<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "cautiously adventurous" attribute feels imbalanced, with "cautiously" underdeveloped; the "vendor" persona is somewhat superficial set dressing for the core internal journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on an instantaneous internal epiphany triggered by convenience; the assigned "glorify" action is more a passive character trait than an active driver of this specific narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mental library, while imaginative, verges on being an overly elaborate and self-consciously literary construct for a spontaneous vision; some descriptive imagery is familiar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emotional impact is present but occasionally undermined by sentimental or slightly heavy-handed phrasing (e.g., "light of distant suns," "faded by...sorrow").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central conceit of the constellation map is original, but the narrative framework of a vision quest and some descriptive language lack fresh distinction from common literary tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While elements are woven together, the story doesn't entirely escape a "written" feel, and the reliance on a highly romanticized internal journey doesn't quite achieve flawless, organic execution.</comment>
