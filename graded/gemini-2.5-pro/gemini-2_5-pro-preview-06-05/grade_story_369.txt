<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character is well-defined and motivated, particularly with "optimistically bitter," but the "fanatical" aspect feels more like intense focus than a truly consuming obsession that the word might imply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves a complete micro-arc effectively within the word limit, but the assigned "wriggle" action is a very small descriptive component rather than a significant plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and storm are powerfully evocative and deeply integrated with the character's internal state and the story's pervasive mood of isolated penance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (puzzle as guilt, solution as feeling, untangling knots) creates significant subtext and thematic depth concerning penance and internal change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core premise of puzzles as a metric for spiritual development is fresh and thoughtfully explored, largely avoiding clich√©s, though a few descriptive phrases ("damp-smelling cardboard") are somewhat familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and thematically resonant piece that uses its constraints well; the central metaphor of the puzzle is compelling and skillfully handled to explore complex internal states.</comment>
