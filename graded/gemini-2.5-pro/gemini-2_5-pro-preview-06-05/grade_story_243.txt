<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's "jumpy" nature is convincingly portrayed through her nervous energy and faltering, creating relatable internal conflict. However, the "necromancer" aspect, while a fascinating concept as a reanimator of "dead code," is more expository in this scene, primarily shown through data interpretation rather than a more active demonstration of her unique necromantic abilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, with the "falter" action adding a brief moment of humanizing tension. The core weakness lies in the transition from analyzing paint drips to obtaining a "root access command"; this critical discovery feels overly accelerated, lacking the intermediate steps that would lend it full logical weight within the established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The retro video game setting is vividly realized with excellent, specific sensory details that immerse the reader. The "old gods slumber" timeframe, while providing a resonant thematic backdrop for Elara's self-reliance, feels somewhat less integrated into the immediate mechanics and atmosphere of the sewer level discovery compared to other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story offers a unique perspective with strong symbolic imagery (King as virus, footsteps as system error) and effectively builds tension. While it 'shows' well and possesses clear subtext, the inherent brevity limits the exploration of profound emotional depth or truly complex thematic nuances expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A highly original amalgamation of necromancy, retro gaming, and cyber-rebellion, showcasing genuine ingenuity and avoiding common tropes. The writing style is distinct and metaphors are generally fresh, with only a minor instance of telling (e.g., "typically bizarre") slightly marring an otherwise authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates impressive cohesion, creatively interweaving its disparate assigned elements into a compelling whole. While the density of concepts is notable for its short form and leaves a lingering intrigue, the slight plot convenience noted earlier prevents it from achieving flawless execution.</comment>
