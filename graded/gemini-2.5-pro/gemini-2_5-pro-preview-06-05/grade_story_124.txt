<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kael's 'skittish drifter' persona is somewhat surface-level; motivation is clear but its 'simple, esoteric' nature isn't fully convincing for the profound act performed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Well-structured arc and effective pacing; however, the connection between Kael's esoteric motivation and the AI's functional repair feels somewhat tenuous without deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a strong mood during the repair; however, the introductory 'barbershop' simile feels anachronistically imposed on the lunar setting's quietude.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong originality in its central conceit, executed with lyrical prose and potent symbolism (ballet shoes); effectively 'shows' the unique repair, achieving genuine artistic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Impressively original, subverting tropes with its fresh core idea (AI repair via dance) and distinctive voice; avoids formulaic pitfalls effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Remarkable cohesion of diverse elements into a resonant narrative; its concise form feels deliberate and impactful, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and thematic depth.</comment>
