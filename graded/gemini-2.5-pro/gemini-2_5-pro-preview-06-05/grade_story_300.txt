<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's determination and distinct voice are strengths; the "wistfully pragmatic" attribute is a somewhat minor note, briefly stated rather than deeply woven into his actions within this scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The unique method of discovery is a strength, driving a clear and coherent plot well-suited to the word count, though the overall plot structure itself is straightforward and linear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The marketplace setting is a strength, vital for the plot's mechanics and Junk Rummaging action; while sensory details are present, phrases like "stench of... ambition" lean more conceptual than purely visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core discovery method (paint smudge map) is a significant strength in originality; however, its impact is slightly diluted by competent yet unexceptional phrasing in some descriptive passages, preventing the prose from feeling uniformly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Creative and cohesive integration of assigned elements is a clear strength, particularly the novel map concept; the story is focused and intriguing, making good use of its constrained length.</comment>
