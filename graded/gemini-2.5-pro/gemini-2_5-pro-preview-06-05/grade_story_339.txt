<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and compelling; however, the "modestly extravagant" attribute feels more like external scene-setting than a deeply integrated trait shaping his specific method of confronting guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is well-structured with a clear symbolic arc for its length; the seesaw cue is a strong catalyst, though the literal act of sorting artifacts slightly simplifies the profound internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is generally well-evoked, but the "prismatic lake" and its connection to "unreliable colors" leans towards overly explicit symbolism, somewhat diminishing subtlety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the seesaw is a significant strength, but the story's impact is slightly undercut by the narrator posing a direct thematic question, a moment of telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core mechanism of the seesaw sound dictating the sorting of truths is a significant point of originality and is skillfully integrated, offering a fresh perspective on confronting past trauma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion and emotional resonance, with most elements artfully combined; however, a few instances of heavy-handed symbolism or direct exposition prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
