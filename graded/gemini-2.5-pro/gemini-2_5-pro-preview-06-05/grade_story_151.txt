<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation is clear and her actions align, but the stated "moral dilemma" feels intellectually flattened by her "unassailable logic" until the very end, limiting deep character exploration within the narrative's scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and the central action propels it, but the wider societal stakes regarding the "idol" and "Mandate" remain too abstract, diminishing the urgency and impact of her mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is well-established and thematically consistent, particularly the "crystalline silence," but the world's "perfect, rational peace" is more asserted than immersively shown, relying on a narrow sensory palette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story exhibits strong symbolic craft (veil, snowflake) and intellectual provocation; however, emotional engagement for the reader is significantly muted by the pervasive intellectual coolness until the final sentence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method of reintroducing emotion is strikingly original, but the foundational "emotionless society" is a familiar trope, and some thematic phrasing like "rationally organic" feels overly insistent and slightly artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is intelligent and demonstrates high cohesion in its use of disparate elements, yet its pervasive intellectual coolness and the abstract nature of the central conflict prevent it from achieving "flawless" emotional impact or truly transcending its conceptual origins.</comment>
