<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's profound pessimism and unique motivation ("to carry a flickering candle") are compellingly integrated and drive his actions; the "edgy tradesman" aspect is subtly realized, primarily through his defiant, niche profession and philosophical outlook rather than overt rebellious traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally coherent with strong pacing, driven by the clear action ("vectorize") and the tangible deadline of the windmill; the resolution is both thematically fitting and satisfyingly melancholic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, with the "mushroom house" and "forgotten windmill" creating a uniquely potent atmosphere rich in specific sensory details (spores, ozone, bioluminescence) that perfectly underscore the themes of decay and ephemeral preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive literary craft, particularly in its use of resonant symbolism (candle, key, windmill) and potent metaphors ("rust in the rain," "memory was a liar"); it achieves significant emotional and thematic depth, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking originality is evident in the core concept of "salvaging ghosts" and "vectorizing memories"; the language is largely fresh and evocative, with only very minor instances of more familiar phrasing (e.g., "worn blanket") in an otherwise inventive narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is a highly cohesive and polished piece, masterfully integrating its diverse assigned elements into a singular, memorable narrative that feels complete and resonant despite its brevity, showcasing considerable creative thought.</comment>
