<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's core motivation is clear and effectively drives his actions; however, his defining attributes ("brainy," "awkward") are stated more than deeply demonstrated or explored in a nuanced way.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot presents a clear and satisfying arc with a creative central action; however, the swift and complete success of the protagonist's efforts against an established colonial administration feels somewhat idealized and lessens credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay setting is exceptionally well-integrated, providing plot resources, atmosphere, and thematic resonance; the contrast with the "sterile" colony is effective, if a common trope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves good impact through powerful central imagery and symbolism (doll, ephemeral art); while emotionally resonant, its core themes about heritage and art's power are familiar rather than strikingly original insights.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central method of protest is highly original and imaginatively conceived; however, some descriptive phrases are uninspired, and the almost frictionless success feels somewhat conventional for this genre.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong cohesion by effectively integrating most assigned elements, particularly the doll, bay, and art method; the overall impact is slightly lessened by a too-neat resolution and less organic integration of minor attributes.</comment>
