<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "swashbuckler" archetype feels superficial; Kael's cerebral solution (charting marbles) doesn't fully align with or develop this core descriptor beyond a "defiant posture" and a minor use of the hatpin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central plot mechanism—marbles directly informing a complex data-void frequency—is a significant conceptual leap presented without sufficient grounding, feeling more like a convenient assertion than an earned discovery within the story's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk atmosphere, with its "sky-razor storm" and "neon signs," is vividly rendered and effectively supports the narrative's tension and character aesthetics, representing a clear strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While possessing evocative imagery ("candle of kindness," "constellation of chance"), the crucial moment of Kael's genius insight ("electrifying purpose") is told rather than convincingly shown through a discernible process, weakening the intellectual payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core premise of the solution (marbles as data-map) is original, but its instantaneous, perfectly-formed arrival in Kael's mind lacks the nuanced process of human discovery, bordering on narrative fiat and feeling overly convenient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story's imaginative core is hampered by its central plot device (the marble-map insight), which feels more asserted than logically developed, creating a flaw that would likely prevent publication where flawless execution is paramount.</comment>
