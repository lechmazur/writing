<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's "small grifts" past feels slightly insufficient to fully ground the profound depth of his "lull of remorse" and the elaborate, personal ritual he enacts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot is entirely internal; while achieving a clear personal arc and resolution for Silas, its lack of external consequence or development makes it feel somewhat slight for the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting elements like "Agri-Unit 7" and "gray-clad workers" are functional but lean towards generic dystopian tropes; the stated "mild fervor" tone isn't consistently suffused throughout the narrative atmosphere, which often reads more melancholic or quietly resigned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While possessing effective symbolism (tape dispenser) and subtext, crucial emotional summations towards the end ("He had faced his ghosts and found not terror, but a quiet, shared normalcy") veer into telling, diluting the otherwise well-handled 'show, don't tell' approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central conceit of interrogating personal ghosts is fresh and compelling, but some descriptive language ("sterile purgatory," "crush the soul") draws from a common well of dystopian/introspective expressions, slightly dulling its absolute originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and effectively integrates its core elements into a poignant character sketch, but minor conventionalities in setting description and a subtly underplayed pervasiveness of the "mild fervor" tone keep it just shy of the truly exceptional mark demanded.</comment>
