<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kael’s arc from unease to settled purpose is clear and central; his initial characterization beyond "unease" is functional but not deeply layered for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc with effective pacing for its length; the "lurch" as the precise catalyst for the epiphany, while plausible, feels slightly convenient as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent; the sterile, dangerous station strongly contrasts with poignant Earth memories (postcards, coathanger origin), creating a rich, immersive atmosphere supporting the core themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic impact and evocative imagery ("cosmic apology," "lethal ballet"); the protagonist's profound conceptual insight is grasped very rapidly from a visual shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept of reinterpreting the debris field to find pathways offers significant originality; prose is generally strong, avoiding cliché and achieving an individual voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with assigned elements effectively serving a clear thematic purpose; successfully delivers a thoughtful message about perspective within its brief scope.</comment>
