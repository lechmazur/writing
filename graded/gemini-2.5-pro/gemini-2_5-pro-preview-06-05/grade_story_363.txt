<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grief is a powerful, defining motivator. The 'indifferent' aspect of 'passionately indifferent' is present but less sharply etched than the 'passionate'.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The internal plot of memory retrieval is compelling and well-paced. The societal framework (Order of Geologists) is effective but feels slightly appended rather than fully integrated from earlier on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere of hushed intensity is masterfully rendered. The 'levity' in 'poignant levity' is confined to a single, albeit effective, final phrase, making that aspect of the tone minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bell, ledger) and 'showing' creates profound thematic depth and emotional resonance; the unique perspective is highly memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original premise (deciphering machine failure via trauma) executed with fresh metaphors and precise, non-formulaic language, avoiding clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive, integrating its core elements into a thought-provoking narrative that lingers; creative synthesis is a key strength.</comment>
