<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation drives plot, but character depth beyond this single focus is limited; "conjurer" aspect feels somewhat underdeveloped until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Efficient plot arc and satisfying resolution, though the inciting incident (road closure) and the guardian's swift concession are somewhat convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Grotto atmosphere and its symbolic role are strong; the broader "cave pearl diving school" setting remains underdeveloped beyond the entrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Potent central symbolism (light pearl, index card) and a satisfying thematic resolution, but the final thematic summary ("he had become it") is slightly too explicit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core magical concept (pearl of thought) is highly original; however, this is somewhat counterbalanced by reliance on some familiar tropes (wise guardian) and similes ("eyes like polished river stones").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion of disparate elements and thematic clarity; for the highest tier, it needs more consistent stylistic distinction and nuanced execution throughout.</comment>
