<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's "gentle" attribute is somewhat asserted rather than consistently demonstrated through her actions and internal process until the final reinterpretation of justice; her dominant portrayal is one of intense, fearful determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and coherent arc within the tight word limit, with the rune discovery serving as an effective pivot; the compression of "years gathering" is a minor concession to brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric contrast and evocative sensory details, particularly the olfactory elements; however, the specified "timeframe" functions as a backstory catalyst rather than the predominant temporal setting of the narrative action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its poignant redefinition of justice and effective symbolism, though some key emotional states are stated with a directness that could be more subtly rendered for the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its specific magical conceit (reversed runes) and the nature of the butterfly, but the underlying structure (outsider transforming a closed community) and occasional phrases ("a wave of X") tread familiar ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable cohesion, skillfully weaving its assigned elements into a thematically resonant narrative, yet minor points in character actualization and occasional directness in emotional exposition prevent it from reaching "flawless."</comment>
