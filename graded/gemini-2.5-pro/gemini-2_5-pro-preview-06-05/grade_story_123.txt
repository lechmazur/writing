<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "gleefully morose" attribute is superficially applied and feels like an affectation; character depth beyond thematic function and maternal devotion is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot is overly straightforward, lacking significant tension or complexity within the word limit; the "sweep" action is inconsequential to the main narrative thrust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric descriptions are capable (e.g., "beautiful decay") but rely on familiar tropes of post-fall settings without achieving exceptional, memorable distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story leans on fairly conventional symbolism (e.g., "tiny, green promise") and somewhat telegraphed emotion; literary devices are present but don't elevate the narrative to a surprising or profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The central premise of a lone figure reviving a fallen world is a well-worn trope; while prose is competent, it lacks a truly distinctive stylistic signature or genuinely surprising subversions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A proficient exercise in thematic storytelling that integrates its elements serviceably, but ultimately falls short of exceptional due to conventionality in plot and character development.</comment>
