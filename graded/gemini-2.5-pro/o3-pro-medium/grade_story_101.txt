<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Narrator's motivation is clear and enacted. Weakness: Aurelius is a somewhat archetypal "wise mentor"; the narrator's internal shift from "panic" to "manic clarity" is rapid and narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strength: The plot achieves a clear and complete arc from problem to resolution. Weakness: The client's complete turnaround and paying double for impromptu origami feels overly convenient and strains credulity, even for a metaphorical piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strength: The design studio and the parade offer effective contrasting atmospheres with good sensory details. Weakness: The "before first being learns to record its experiences" timeframe feels intellectually imposed and largely disconnected from the tangible plot, more an ornamental flourish than foundational.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strength: Contains memorable central metaphors (bee, maps, origami) and explores subtext. Weakness: The prose is so consistently elevated and metaphorical that it lacks modulation and occasionally feels strained or self-consciously "fine writing" (e.g., "resilience wearing silk plumage").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strength: The specific combination of design, philosophy, and bee symbolism offers some freshness, and the origami solution is unique. Weakness: The pervasive highly stylized voice can feel artificial; metaphors, while often inventive, are so dense they sometimes feel formulaically inserted rather than entirely organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strength: Demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements into a thematically cohesive whole. Weakness: The ambition for literary depth sometimes leads to elements (like the abstract timeframe or overly rich prose) feeling less than seamlessly integrated or natural, hinting at the constraints of the prompt.</comment>
