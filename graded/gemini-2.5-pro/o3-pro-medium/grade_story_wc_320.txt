<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique craft. Her interiority is revealed through embodied, resonant details like being "serenely electric," which connects her state to the artifact's charge. The character is defined by a serene competence balanced by the genuine struggle against decay and time, making her final act of creation feel earned and purposeful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, where resonant images build toward the climax. The structure is an elegant two-part movement from reception to action. Closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the landscape transforms) with a clearly legible cost—the artifact is spent and the duty is cyclical—which lands with significant weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and indispensable. The "abandoned radio tower city" is not just backdrop; it directly constrains action (no power for lifts, forcing the use of a glider) and provides the crucial infrastructure (the toppled pylon) for the climax. This integration of environment and action is seamless, with details like "fog pulsed in squares" adding both atmosphere and thematic depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conflict against "silence" is established early and effectively externalized through the decaying city. The stakes—revitalizing a dying homeland—are high, and the pressure is maintained by the ticking clock of the "lunar perigee" and dawn. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and choice, with a clear cost that forecloses one path while opening another.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings is powerfully dramatized through the story's climax. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme twice ("For that was her plain craft, fantasy practicality fused: to find the beginning in every ending"). This thematic echo slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final image by resorting to telling, preventing an otherwise outstanding execution from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is the story's greatest strength, maintaining a consistent lyrical and mythic tone without sacrificing clarity. The prose establishes a distinct perceptual signature for Mara, where technology and mysticism are described with the same poetic precision ("rasped with constellations," "folded municipal wings"). Point of view is controlled masterfully, creating a deeply immersive experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, original imagery ("the air smelled like struck quartz"). The prose is rhythmic and controlled, accelerating for the glider flight and slowing for the delicate work of tuning. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, character, or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's originality lies in its seamless synthesis of disparate elements: radio astronomy, Hollywood mythology, and a form of practical magic. It transforms the "last archivist" trope into something fresh and emotionally resonant. The core concept of interpreting cosmic signals as narratives is compelling and executed with a unique vision that feels both strange and inevitable.</comment>
