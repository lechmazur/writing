<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Initial repression is clear, but the transformation driven by the vision is too swift and total for deep psychological credibility; the "secretly terrified" attribute feels underdeveloped and has minimal lasting impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Achieves a complete arc efficiently within the word limit, but the rapid pacing and somewhat convenient catalysts (pin drop, scavengers' easy trade) slightly undermine its organic development and believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the overgrown city setting and the symbolic perfume bottle are richly imagined and atmospherically potent, deeply enhancing the narrative's mood and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thematic resonance around artistic liberation and striking central imagery (verse on skin) are impactful, though some literary devices and descriptive language verge on being self-consciously florid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh (marker like a comet), the narrative risks "purple prose" ("green marrow," "ruined starlight"), leans on the "artist's awakening" trope, and uses a somewhat too-magical catalyst for character change, hindering profound originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ambitiously integrates its assigned elements with a strong central theme of artistic liberation, but the very swift character arc and consistently ornate prose prevent it from reaching "flawless" publishability for a top-tier venue.</comment>
