<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's core attribute "exceptionally usual" is thematically apt but stylistically awkward, slightly marring an otherwise clear motivation and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the plot arc is complete, its engine—the perfectly convenient misdelivery of all necessary advanced equipment—is a significant contrivance that undermines believability at a high literary level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere and setting strongly support the theme, though the rationale for the station's "abandoned" status alongside active heritage claims feels underdeveloped for flawless world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying symbolic resolution and uses literary devices effectively, but its thematic explorations are often too explicit, lacking the nuanced subtlety expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The genre blend offers some freshness, but overall originality is hampered by the central plot convenience ("misdelivered packages") and the recurring, somewhat ungainly, key phrase "exceptionally usual."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Despite strong thematic cohesion using the assigned elements, the narrative's fundamental reliance on an overly serendipitous plot device (perfectly misdelivered advanced tech) prevents it from reaching the "flawless" standard required.</comment>
