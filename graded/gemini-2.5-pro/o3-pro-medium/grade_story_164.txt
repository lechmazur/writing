<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "wistful" attribute is well-integrated and motivation clear, but Radek's internal complexity (e.g., "secretly doubt themselves") is explicitly stated rather than fully shown, slightly diminishing its depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A coherent narrative arc with a clear beginning, middle, and thematic resolution is achieved effectively within the word limit, driven by the central "kindle" action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid world-building and strong sensory details ("neon rain hissed," "dust motes swirled") create a deeply immersive and thematically resonant atmosphere; this is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of fresh imagery (circuits as veins, iron promises) and symbolism effectively convey subtext and theme, though the sheer density of literary devices is almost overwhelming for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual originality is a strength, but the relentlessly ornate and adjectivally dense prose style frequently borders on overwriting, potentially hindering organic emotional impact for a top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high conceptual cohesion and creative integration of elements, yet the ambitious stylistic flourish, while often striking, occasionally feels self-conscious, overshadowing more subtle narrative development.</comment>
