<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's initial academic motivation ("to study human behaviors") feels superficially connected to her profound personal claustrophobia and ache, slightly undermining the journey's emotional wellspring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot delivers a satisfying arc within the word limit, but the "inflame" element's critical consequences are summarized rather than shown, reducing their dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The highly imaginative "floating rock tea house" setting is a standout strength, creating a perfect liminal space for the story's magical realism and introspective themes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the core premise is notably original, the prose sometimes employs elaborate constructions where sharper concision is needed, and Wren's "wise mentor" role, though uniquely flavored, touches on familiar territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The creative synthesis of disparate elements into a cohesive narrative is a significant achievement, though the story's full potential is marginally constrained by a less than compelling initial character impetus for such a personal transformation.</comment>
