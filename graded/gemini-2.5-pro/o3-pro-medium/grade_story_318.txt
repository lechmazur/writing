<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aloofness is well-maintained with a subtle arc, but the internal shift feels swift and some descriptive phrasing for his past self ("purely mechanical veins") is clich√©d.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear arc and pacing for a short piece, but the late introduction of external stakes ("approaching catastrophe") feels underdeveloped and the communal resolution somewhat simplistic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative and well-integrated world-building with strong sensory details, though the sheer density of fantastical imagery occasionally borders on the overwrought (e.g., "mnemonic sap").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic development and effective use of symbolism (e.g., the spoon, the lullaby), but the highly ornate prose style frequently risks becoming 'purple,' which can detract from sophisticated impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept is strikingly original, yet the narrative's execution sometimes relies on a self-consciously 'literary' prose style that feels overly elaborate rather than effortlessly authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Creative fusion of elements into a memorable vignette, but the ambitious prose, while often vivid ("sour candy melting over a bruise"), ultimately feels too consistently overwrought for flawless execution.</comment>
