<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amelia’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between ancestral loyalty and moral imperative. Her motivation—"Curiosity, her oldest vice"—is established early and credibly carries her into the high-stakes confrontation. The final choice to intervene is earned through the scene's pressure, and her action of scratching the orrery with the pen nib is a perfect synthesis of her inheritance and her newfound purpose, demonstrating a decisive and costly change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story operates on a flawless Causal lens, where each beat logically compels the next, from the cryptic call to the final declaration. The structure is tight and focused, using a single scene to maximum effect. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, made tangible by the scratching of the orrery and Amelia's on-page commitment to reparations—a clear, high-cost outcome that reconfigures her entire world and fulfills the narrative promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional world-building, moving from the "dormant wing" to the sublime "observatory above clouds." The brass orrery is not mere decoration; it is the physical manifestation of the story's central conflict and becomes the very tool of resolution. The environment directly constrains the action and powerfully charges the final images, from the "stars themselves...taking dictation" to the "rewritten universe," making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The conflict is expertly handled, escalating from intellectual curiosity to a profound moral crisis with clearly defined stakes: family legacy versus public truth. The pressure intensifies perfectly when Felix produces the carbon copies, foreclosing denial as an option. Amelia’s agency is central to the resolution, and the cost of her decision is made explicit and substantial ("sale of her summer estate"), giving the climax immense weight and consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of journalistic responsibility and the weight of inherited guilt is explored with remarkable subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the orrery and its "orbits of regret." The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of the stars as "editors satisfied with a rewritten universe," which provides a non-literal, conceptually rich answer to the central question of how one rectifies the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with unwavering control, establishing a distinct and consistent voice for Amelia. The prose is infused with a journalistic perceptual signature, using metaphors of newsprint, ink, and photography that feel authentic to her character. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and sharp, with Felix’s line about redacting the universe perfectly encapsulating the story's core tension. The narrative voice modulates beautifully with the rising stakes without a single slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is consistently elevated, dense with evocative imagery and precise language ("Storm clouds bruised the horizon," "planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret"). While bordering on ornate, the figurative language is so well-integrated with the story's core themes that it enhances rather than obstructs momentum. There are no discernible loops or redundancies; every sentence serves a purpose, creating a polished, rhythmic, and highly effective narrative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes—the guilty inheritance, the crusading journalist—into a brilliantly fresh and memorable narrative. The steampunk-inflected, literary setting of the dirigible and observatory is highly original, and the central conceit of the headline-orrery is ingenious. The execution feels entirely unique, transforming a conventional conflict into something mythic and resonant, demonstrating a singular artistic vision.</comment>
