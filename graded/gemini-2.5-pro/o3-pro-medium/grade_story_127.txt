<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Celeste's "creatively blocked" attribute feels superficially addressed, as her subsequent plan is highly inventive; Aldren's profound transformation occurs with remarkable speed, slightly diminishing its believability given his initial "molten rancor."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core plot of personal reconciliation is coherent and well-paced, but the implied resolution of large-scale societal riots from this single act feels unearned and strains credulity within the story's scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details that effectively establish mood and complement the narrative's blend of mechanics and emotion, creating a distinct atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of evocative imagery and symbolism (coral, gauntlet), creating a poignant emotional impact; however, the grandiosity of the final lines about societal change feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the core reconciliation method is original, some metaphors ("shutters meeting first dawn") border on familiar poeticisms, and the rapid emotional shifts, though impactful, slightly undercut deep psychological nuance for Aldren.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story masterfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and imaginative narrative, though the ambitious thematic leap from personal to societal peace at the conclusion feels somewhat overextended for its brief length.</comment>
