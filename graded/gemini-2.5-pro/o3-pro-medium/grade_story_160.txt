<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The attribute "analytically free" feels somewhat underdeveloped and less impactful than other character facets like "wilderness wisdom"; motivation becomes clear but isn't sharply defined by this specific attribute initially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc and pacing for a short piece; the assigned "acknowledge" action is present but less central as a plot driver than the pursuit and use of the goggles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the abandoned repair bay setting is richly atmospheric and deeply resonant with the story's core themes of endings and remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High literary merit with potent imagery and a compelling exploration of narrative finality; the ending provides a nuanced and satisfying thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Demonstrates originality in its central conceit and execution, with a distinctive prose style; some elaborate phrasing skirts "purple prose" but largely serves the ambitious, literary tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Very cohesive and creative synthesis of elements; the story achieves significant thematic depth and leaves a lasting impression despite its brevity.</comment>
