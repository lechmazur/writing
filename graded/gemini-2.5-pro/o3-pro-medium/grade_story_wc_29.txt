<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mina’s motivation to protect humanity is clear and her actions are consistent. The conflict with Calvin effectively reveals her integrity under pressure. However, Calvin feels like a one-note antagonist driven by pure opportunism, and Mina's backstory mention ("orphaned childhood nights") feels like a fleeting detail rather than a lived-in trait that informs a costly choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Causal lens with a clear Decisive Change at the climax. Orientation is handled well. The plot's primary weakness is the softness of the resolution; the campus-wide unity via subsonics happens too conveniently, and Calvin's neutralization is abrupt, making the cost of Mina's victory feel less tangible than the build-up would suggest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exemplary, functioning as a complete toolkit for the protagonist. The university radio station is not a passive backdrop; the mixing board, auxiliary antenna, and even the town's subwoofers are integral, constraining choices and directly enabling the climax. Atmospheric details like "LEDs like candles in a crypt" are vivid and purposeful, charging the scene without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the tricksters from harvesting division—is signaled early and effectively. The conflict escalates well when Calvin enters, creating a tangible, immediate threat that forces Mina's hand. While her agency drives the resolution, the final confrontation feels deflated; the cosmic and human threats are neutralized too easily, slightly undermining the tension so carefully built.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of unity achieved through cleverness over force emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the auroras is a powerful, non-literal thematic payoff. However, the story's last sentence ("sometimes the smallest sound can reorder galaxies") is an explicit thematic summary that undermines the preceding resonance, stating the moral directly instead of letting the events speak for themselves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent "ethereal grit" tone that fits the concept perfectly. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Mina, and her perceptual signature is specific and controlled. While Calvin’s dialogue borders on cliché ("voice silk over steel"), the overall prose texture is strong and character-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose contains many striking images and has a confident rhythm. However, it is marred by minor but noticeable artifacts. There is some redundancy ("widening like cracks in ice" followed immediately by a description of the divides) and the final paragraph leans on summary, telling the reader what to think about the events rather than letting the final image land on its own.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's central premise is highly original, blending the mundane world of college radio with a cosmic, mythological threat. The specific mechanics of the conflict—using subsonic frequencies to foster unity against "prank gods" who feed on discord—feels fresh and thoughtfully executed. The synthesis of genres and ideas is seamless and memorable.</comment>
