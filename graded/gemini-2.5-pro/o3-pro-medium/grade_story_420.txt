<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation and artistic vision are clear and compelling; "excited boredom" effectively captures her state, though she serves the poetic concept perhaps more than she fully transcends it into a deeply unpredictable persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is elegantly compressed, with the "imploding idea" effectively launching the creative act; the curators' immediate, unanimous agreement feels slightly expedient, even if poetically justified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with fossilized bones and the lingering quiet of the museum creating a potent canvas for inspiration; sensory details are consistently strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abundant, generally striking literary devices ("photon clay," "aurora feathers") create a dense, poetic texture; the sheer volume of figurative language occasionally borders on self-aware artistry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core concept and its execution are highly original, and metaphors largely fresh; minor phrase repetitions ("excited boredom," "theoretically free") and one slightly dissonant image ("brewing thunder yawn") are small blemishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are impressively interwoven into a cohesive and thought-provoking whole; the poetic ambition is commendable and largely, memorably achieved within the constraints.</comment>
