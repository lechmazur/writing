<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirissa's core trait as a "faux fortune teller with real visions" is compelling and drives her initial caution and eventual bravery. Her motivation evolves logically from personal seeking to communal responsibility. However, the repeated, somewhat mannered "regularly seldom" phrasing, while attempting to define a character quirk, slightly affects the naturalness of her portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot possesses a clear and satisfying arc from discovery to resolution within the word limit, driven effectively by the "explore" action. Cause and effect are logical. The pacing is well-managed. The primary minor weakness is the somewhat awkward "regularly seldom" construction, which, when repeated, feels like a slight stumble in an otherwise smooth narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptionally strong, with the "extinct language archive" and "spring planting" timeframe creating a potent blend of ancient mystery and burgeoning life. Sensory details ("petrified into stone ribbons," "mossy silence," "translucent syllables") are highly evocative and effectively immerse the reader, strongly supporting the story's concept and Mirissa's motivations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant impact through its rich use of metaphor, symbolism, and a well-developed theme of knowledge stewardship. It 'shows' effectively and evokes reflection. The ending is purposeful. The main point of critique lies in the stylistic choice of "regularly seldom," which, while a conscious literary device, borders on affectation and slightly detracts from the overall polish of the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates strong originality in its combination of elements and the nuanced handling of emotion, particularly "peaceful anger." Metaphors are generally fresh. The story avoids most AI-like tendencies. However, the distinctive but somewhat artificial phrasing of "regularly seldom," used twice, stands out as a potential stylistic affectation that could be perceived as overly constructed rather than organically flowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is highly cohesive, weaving its assigned elements into a meaningful and resonant narrative rather than feeling like a checklist. The brief length feels deliberate and impactful. The creative combination of ancient languages with agricultural renewal is a significant strength. The only recurring minor detraction is the self-conscious "regularly seldom" phrasing, which keeps it from feeling entirely flawless.</comment>
