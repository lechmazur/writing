<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "angrily peaceful" attribute, particularly the "angry" component, feels more asserted by the narrator than authentically embodied or consistently demonstrated through a range of Lyra's actions or internal thoughts, weakening its impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the story achieves a clear arc, the plot thread involving hacking music playlists to communicate, and the subsequent AI interference, is resolved by a method (the hug) that feels disconnected from her tech skills, making that particular conflict and skill set seem less consequential to the ultimate breakthrough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates numerous disparate elements; however, the sheer density of these concepts within the very short form occasionally makes the narrative feel slightly overstuffed, preventing a sense of flawless elegance and effortlessness.</comment>
