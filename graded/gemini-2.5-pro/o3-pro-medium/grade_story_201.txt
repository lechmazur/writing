<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attribute "whimsical" is more asserted than deeply shown; core motivation is clear but character depth is limited by brevity and style.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear arc and good pacing, but the "shooting stars" as the specific method of *proof* is slightly less clear than the act of aligning the musical score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and timeframe create a powerfully evocative atmosphere with rich sensory detail, strongly enhancing the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Abundant literary devices and strong imagery create impact, but the lyrical style occasionally risks becoming overwrought, and some emotional states are told directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements with a distinct, ambitious style, but for top-tier publication, the prose needs more restraint and the plot mechanics minor sharpening.</comment>
