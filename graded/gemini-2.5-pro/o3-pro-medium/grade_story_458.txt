<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the "spiritually secular" attribute feels somewhat superficially applied through the divination method; deeper internal landscape or character voice isn't fully realized in the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Core arc is present, but coherence hinges on accepting a highly idiosyncratic divination as plot-directing fact, and the "second granted by prophecy" feels like an unearned contrivance for pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong evocation of mood and setting, with good sensory details; "fractal sorrow" is a striking, if abstract, tonal anchor that complements the abandoned, decaying world effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ambitious use of literary devices and impactful themes, but the prose is occasionally overwrought, and the density of abstract concepts can sometimes obscure rather than illuminate within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Core ideas show originality, but reliance on a convenient prophecy and a somewhat clich√©d ghostly affirmation detracts; the highly stylized prose occasionally feels forced or overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Creatively combines elements, but the narrative feels somewhat overburdened by its conceptual density and stylistic ambitions, resulting in moments that feel more asserted than organically earned.</comment>
