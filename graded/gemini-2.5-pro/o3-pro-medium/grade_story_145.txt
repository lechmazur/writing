<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core attribute ("uncertainly certain") is promising, but Tamsin's "infamous dropout" status lacks sufficient depth, and the council's characterization as "spectral tyrants" is undermined by their swift, unconvincing change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story presents a clear arc and an inventive central method (echo test), the pivotal confrontation with the council resolves with implausible speed, significantly weakening the established stakes and overall narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The world-building and atmosphere are the story's strongest assets; evocative descriptions, strong sensory details, and the fittingly mystical timeframe create a rich and immersive environment for the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often lyrical with effective imagery, but it frequently tips into overwriting; the crucial emotional turning point with the council feels asserted rather than earned, diminishing its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>A distinct stylistic voice is present, yet the tendency towards ornate prose can feel affected. The council's rapid capitulation strains believability, lacking the nuanced emotional logic expected beyond familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates commendable ambition in its thematic scope and integration of disparate elements, but significant flaws in pacing the resolution and a need for greater prose discipline prevent it from achieving top-tier publishability.</comment>
