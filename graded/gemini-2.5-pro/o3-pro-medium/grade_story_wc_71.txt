<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire scene. Her interiority is strong, showing a blend of methodical process and intuitive belief. The final earned change in understanding is credible, though the moment of self-aware insight ("inadvertently profound") reads as slightly diagnostic, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless embodiment of her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere until a decisive cadence shift at the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house's state changes from "mute" to "in repose," is earned and legible. The cost is the expenditure of Mara's focus and the completion of her purpose in this specific place, marked by her departure as the world returns to normal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph, with selective, purposeful sensory details creating a palpable sense of liminality and presence. The setting is not a backdrop but the central subject of the conflict. Key objects—the orris root, the swan, the wishbone—are indispensable to the plot, constraining choice and charging the final image, fulfilling the criteria for exceptional execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake: to understand and "wake" the house. The conflict escalates effectively from a failed physical attempt (moving the swan) to a successful vocal one ("sanctify"), representing a meaningful deepening of tactics. The resolution is earned through Mara's agency, and the cost is legible in the finality of the moment and the house achieving repose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of healing through listening and correct "placement" emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the realization "Displacement was the illness, placement the cure..." borders on an overly explicit thematic statement, slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer"). The lyrical voice is the story's primary engine, and its syntax and rhythm modulate effectively with the rising tension. The prose as a whole defines Mara's unique way of experiencing the world, making the voice inseparable from the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and dense, with striking and original figurative language. However, the story is marked by a significant line-level flaw: "Loneliness can carve deeper than knives, she thought, inadvertently profound and startled by her own words." This combines a cliché with meta-commentary that momentarily breaks the narrative voice and pulls the reader out of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise—a psychic diagnostician who heals buildings by correcting displaced objects—is a highly original transformation of the haunted house trope. The execution feels specific and authentic, avoiding gimmickry in favor of emotional truth. The story’s unique synthesis of concept, tone, and character action feels both fresh and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
