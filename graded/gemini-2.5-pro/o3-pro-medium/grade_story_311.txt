<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Milo's internal journey from tense suppression to serene, stubborn resolve is compellingly portrayed and consistent with his motivation; Holm, however, remains a functional but largely unidimensional antagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is satisfyingly complete and pivots cleverly on "ratify" within the word limit; the children's stories forming a map, while fitting "serendipity," borders on narrative convenience for such a high-stakes escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and potent symbolism (e.g., the photograph as "fertilizer for tomorrowâ€™s unregulated gardens") create strong impact; however, a phrase like "chlorophyll prayers" risks tipping into whimsical sentimentality, slightly jarring the overall tone.</comment>
