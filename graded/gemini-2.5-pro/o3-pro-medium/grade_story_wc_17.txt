<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is established early with a compelling, poetic goal. Her character is revealed through her methodical actions and her reverence for the past. The final choice—to become a guardian rather than a seller of secrets—represents an earned and significant change, paying off the story’s central thematic question with a tangible, personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, elegant causal chain where each discovery logically enables the next. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Liora renounces a path, and the cost (a comfortable life) is clearly legible. The use of her established perceptive ability to bridge the informational gap left by the burned diaries is a well-executed plot point, not a convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist. Details like the "bruised orange sky" and "fractal geometry" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's unique profession. The final image of the quivering ivy leaves, charged by the discovery, exemplifies how the environment constrains choice and carries thematic weight, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes escalate beautifully from a personal, esoteric quest to a profound moral responsibility. The discovery of the negative and the recording provides a meaningful tightening, forcing an internal conflict with a clear choice between personal gain and collective memory. The final decision is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost—the forfeiture of an easier life—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of legacy and memory is potent and emerges organically from the story’s discoveries. The final image of the "awake" walls is a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question. However, the line "the past always leans forward, balancing its elbows on the future's table" is an overly explicit thematic statement that momentarily breaks the subtextual spell, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent from the opening line. The prose's rhythm and rich, specific vocabulary create a perceptual signature perfectly suited to an "echo cartographer." The point of view remains tightly controlled, modulating effectively from methodical observation to awe-struck reverence without any leakage or unearned knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with powerful imagery and varied syntax that propels the narrative. Lines like "brittle paper to sigh into dust" demonstrate high-level craft. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it verges on becoming overwrought in a few places, but it never obscures clarity or momentum at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of an "echo cartographer" who maps the dreams of walls is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It transforms a familiar post-apocalyptic setting into a unique space for exploring memory and hope. The synthesis of acoustics, architecture, and legacy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, representing a singular artistic vision.</comment>
