<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Core motivation to preserve craft is compelling and clear; "romantically doomed" attribute feels superficial and lacks deep integration with his primary actions or the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and uses the "evading spotlight" concept well; however, the resolution of the escape relies on convenient poetic devices that stretch narrative logic even within a fantastical context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "utopia design studio" provides a potent thematic contrast for the protagonist's mission, and the "forgotten revelry" atmosphere is effectively deployed for plot advancement; sensory details are generally strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and thematic depth; however, the repetition of the central oxymoron ("raucously silent") and the pervasive density of ornate language verge on overwriting, slightly diminishing its overall impact for a "flawless" standard.</comment>
