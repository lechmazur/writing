<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strength: Consistent, melancholic voice fitting the "weary undertaker." Weakness: Motivation's mystical trigger ("dead whispered") feels convenient, insufficiently grounded in prior character psychology beyond general despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strength: Clear narrative arc and effective pacing within the word limit. Weakness: The "tribal knowledge" underpinning the magical mechanics is delivered as exposition rather than being organically woven into the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Exceptionally vivid and immersive world-building ("cracked neon," "constellations leaking silver"); the atmosphere is a standout element, deeply integrated with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strength: Powerful central theme of hope and self-confrontation with a resonant ending. Weakness: Thematic realization is very explicitly stated, and the high density of metaphors, while often striking, borders on being stylistically overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strength: Highly original premise combining disparate elements in a fresh way. Weakness: The prose, while rich, shows a tendency towards "purple prose" through its relentless accumulation of ornate descriptions and similes, potentially alienating a discerning literary audience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strength: Creative and largely cohesive integration of assigned elements into an impactful, brief narrative. Weakness: Some foundational lore feels slightly forced, and the otherwise rich style occasionally strains under its own descriptive weight, lacking consistent restraint.</comment>
