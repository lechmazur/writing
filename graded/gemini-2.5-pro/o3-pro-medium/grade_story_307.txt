<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Asserted attributes serve the allegory, but Mira's deeper personal internalization of the conflict between "duty" and "rebellion" feels somewhat underdeveloped before her decisive action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core action (shaping sound to sight) is inventive and drives a clear arc; however, the external conflict via the aldermen materializes with notable convenience, slightly diminishing verisimilitude even in a symbolic piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with rich, specific sensory details, creating a strong, supportive environment for the narrative's symbolic intent and the "ethereal grit" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story exhibits ambitious use of literary devices and impactful symbolism, yet the relentless density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, risking a "written" feel over organic imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central concept is genuinely original. However, the consistently ornate prose style, while striving for "ethereal grit," can feel self-consciously 'literary,' potentially detracting from a sense of effortless authenticity for the most discerning reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story creatively integrates its assigned elements with a distinct, ambitious style. However, the pervasive poetic intensity, while sometimes effective, may polarize and slightly hinders its claim to unassailable flawlessness for top-tier publication.</comment>
