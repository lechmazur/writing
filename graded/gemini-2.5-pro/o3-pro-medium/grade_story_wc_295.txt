<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, layered, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict between solitary grief and the need for connection is perfectly resolved by the story's climax. The final choice to broadcast the message is an earned transformation, with the cost being a painful but necessary re-evaluation of her mentor’s legacy. The character arc is compact but complete and deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story employs a hybrid Accumulative-to-Causal lens flawlessly. The structure is elegant and efficient, moving from atmospheric setup to a tight, causal climax and concluding with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's mission. The final Charged Poise, where the decoded warning opens a new path toward mapping aspirations, is a masterful ending that lands with both emotional and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an essential mechanism of the plot. The observatory, with its specific tools, directly enables the story's resolution, while the key object—the daylily-pressed telegram—acts as a powerful emotional and thematic anchor. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and beautifully rendered, creating an atmosphere that is both intimate and cosmic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to honor a mentor and prevent misuse—is established immediately and remains the clear focus. The pressure escalates through a single, decisive intellectual turn where Mira’s agency is paramount. The emotional cost of this breakthrough, a sudden and tragic understanding of her mentor's despair, is rendered with precision and powerfully charges the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the plot, character, and central metaphor. The story resists a simple moral, instead using the final beat to deepen the theme by shifting the burden’s potential from an anchor to a propellant. While a few lines trend slightly toward summary ("comprehension had become communal"), the final image of feather-soft burdens is a resonant and earned thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, establishing a voice that is at once lyrical, intelligent, and emotionally authentic. Mira's perceptual signature, filtering the world through metaphors of light, language, and astronomy, is distinct and consistent. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the story's emotional beats, from quiet contemplation to the intensity of discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates exceptional clarity, density, and elegance, with a sentence-level propulsion that carries the reader effortlessly. Figurative language ("cosmic braille," "sunset trapped in fiber") is not ornamental but integral to the story's conceptual framework. The piece is remarkably clean of scaffolding or redundancy, relying on strong verbs and precise imagery to do its work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics, archaeology, and emotional grief is brilliantly original and seamlessly executed. The story subverts the "lone genius" and "infallible mentor" tropes in a way that feels both surprising and inevitable. It takes the risk of being a quiet, intellectual story and succeeds by grounding its high concept in a deeply felt human reality.</comment>
