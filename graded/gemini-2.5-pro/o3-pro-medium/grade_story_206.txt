<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marrow's development is strong, and her "precisely creative" attribute is well-demonstrated; however, the Regent's swift, convenient redemption arc lacks sufficient psychological depth for this literary tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with an inventive core method (photo trail), but its coherence is weakened by several narrative conveniences (e.g., cooks' immediate compliance, Regent's unescorted pursuit) that feel overly engineered for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong integration of evocative sensory detail (smell, taste, sight of sugar) and the unique candy-craft, creating a vivid, consistent, and resonant atmosphere in the "forgotten market" that fully supports the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves memorable impact through potent, original imagery (e.g., "glassy serpents," "tears steamed off the sugar floor") and thematic complexity regarding kindness and vengeance, showing rather than telling emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central concept of a candy-sculptor rebel is highly original and the prose distinctive; however, the narrative relies on a significant coincidence (sister's identity and dual locket contents) and a somewhat formulaic antagonist transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is ambitiously creative and generally cohesive in its use of assigned elements, but minor plot contrivances and the antagonist's rapid change prevent it from achieving the "flawless" status demanded for prestigious publication.</comment>
