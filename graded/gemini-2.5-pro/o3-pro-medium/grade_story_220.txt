<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Larken's transformation from "aloof" is rapid; his "unstoppable curiosity" is a well-established driver, but the initial "aloof" and "predictably odd" attributes feel somewhat superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into his ongoing persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent plot compression and thematic coherence; a clear and compelling arc is achieved from inciting incident to a thematically resonant resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid and integrated world-building; the setting ("towering labyrinth," "port city") and timeframe ("wounded season") create a powerful, consistent atmosphere that deeply supports the narrative and characters' motivations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of dense, evocative imagery and literary devices (e.g., "rusted accordion," "iron gargoyles," "moulting gull") creates a strong impact and distinct literary style, effectively conveying subtext and theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly original in its synthesis of elements and distinct voice; however, the consistently ornate and concentrated figurative language, while often striking, occasionally borders on self-conscious "purple prose," and Larken's swift behavioral change pushes believability for an "aloof" character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and creative synthesis of assigned elements into a thematically resonant narrative that lingers; the ambitious style and dense imagery are largely successful, defining the story's unique quality.</comment>
