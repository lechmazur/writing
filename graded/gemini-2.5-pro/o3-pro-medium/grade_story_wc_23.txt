<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization is exceptional, defined by a purpose that is both mystical and deeply embodied. Her motivation to answer the call of grief is established through specific, tactile actions rather than summary. The final choice of Earned Stasis—to become a permanent steward—is a powerful culmination of her journey, with the cost of her own freedom made palpable and poignant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances not through causal turns but through a deepening of purpose, culminating in a resonant and emotionally earned closure. The final decision (an Earned Stasis) reconfigures Marrow's identity with a clear, felt cost: departure is foreclosed by the very machine she built to offer it to others. The lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the story's mechanism. The "starlit signal station" is rendered with evocative, specific details that serve the plot directly. The failed hydraulics and scavenged parts, particularly the censer foot, are not mere descriptions but constraints and resources that shape Marrow's actions and charge the final, sacrificial image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story establishes its dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—and deepens it masterfully. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, escalating as Marrow's understanding of her purpose solidifies. The final choice to stay presents an unmistakable cost, trading her own potential "reverse migration" for the solace of others, making the abstract stakes deeply personal and concrete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Thematic handling is superb, exploring grief and memory through the central metaphor of "reverse migration" without a single line of overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the story's strange and beautiful machinery. The final image of Marrow as a "stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light" provides a profound, non-literal resolution that resonates long after reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and utterly distinct, maintaining a consistent tone and psychic distance throughout. The prose itself becomes a reflection of Marrow's patchwork nature, stitching together the mechanical and the mystical with a unique perceptual signature. The narrative control is unwavering, creating an immersive and singular reading experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high-density, purposeful sentences and a strong, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and consistently reinforces the story's core concepts ("constellations... rearranged themselves like letters on a grief-struck page"). There is no verbal scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the accumulative momentum toward the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is a brilliant synthesis of science fiction, fantasy, and literary fiction, resulting in a premise that feels entirely fresh and vital. It transforms familiar tropes of lonely station operators and mysterious signals into a poignant exploration of grief. The conceptual and imagistic risks taken are substantial and pay off with a powerful, emotionally authentic vision.</comment>
