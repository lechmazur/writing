<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dr. Moret's "skewed visionary" attribute is effectively established and drives his actions; however, the "skewed" aspect feels more like an external descriptor than a deeply explored psychological facet. The narrator possesses a distinct and evolving voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is remarkably coherent and achieves a complete arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the core action. The method of temporal travel, while fantastical, serves the narrative well, though the initial "click into alignment" is a slight convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are exceptionally well-realized, with specific and evocative sensory details (e.g., "rain-slick cobblestones and burnt parchment," "conscious fireflies") that create a deeply immersive and fitting mood for the concept of "mundane miracles."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive and the premise highly original, avoiding formulaic writing.
