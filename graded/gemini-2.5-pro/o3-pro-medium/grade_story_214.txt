<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Internal transformation feels somewhat rapid and overly dependent on the mystical event, though motivation ("to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt") is clear and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc and effective use of the "recommence" action, but the fantastical resolution of internal conflict via the inward beam feels convenient, slightly undermining character agency despite its thematic fit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid and original setting ("floating observatory," "between shifts") that perfectly supports the story's "gritty whimsy" tone and themes; sensory details are a significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich in striking imagery and literary devices, with a clear theme ("the upside of loss"). However, the relentless density of figurative language and overtly stated themes (e.g., "absence leaves outlines...") can feel heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, and metaphors are often fresh. However, the pervasive ornateness of the prose, while distinctive, occasionally feels forced or self-conscious, straining for effect rather than achieving effortless authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imaginative and thematically resonant with strong integration of assigned elements. Stylistic over-enrichment and a convenient, magical resolution prevent it from reaching 'flawless' for a top-tier publication.</comment>
