<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lin’s motivation is viscerally clear and his core trait as a "constellation tattooist" is masterfully integrated into the climax, transforming his craft from an external art to an internal map for redemption. The final earned change, from haunted creator to clean archivist, is profound. The internal conflict is embodied in phrases like "circuits inside him twitch," showing rather than telling his struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal structure. The discovery of the letters provides a perfectly motivated path to the climax, and the closure is a Decisive Change with a palpable cost—the "absence" that rushes in. The final beat, where Lin prepares instructions for the next person, provides a resonant and satisfying narrative frame, elevating a personal story into a cyclical one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" is an exceptional, evocative setting that perfectly mirrors the protagonist's internal state. Key objects, especially the amber, are not mere props; the amber becomes the vessel of the conflict and its final state—glowing like a night-light—charges the story's resolution with immense symbolic power, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful, personal stake—atonement for a technological sin—and escalates the pressure through the discovery of a dangerous, arcane solution. The protagonist's agency drives the climactic choice to perform the ritual, and the cost is immediately felt in the shift from overwhelming guilt to a clean, unsettling emptiness. The resolution is earned entirely through this on-page action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Themes of technological hauntings, the archiving of error, and the possibility of atonement are woven together with subtlety and power. The story avoids any moralizing, instead offering the final image of the glowing amber and the laughing baby as a complex, resonant answer to its central problem. The act of writing new instructions deepens the theme from personal salvation to shared responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly controlled, and the narrative voice possesses a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture that is maintained from the first sentence to the last. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, filtering the world through Lin's preoccupation with orbits, code, and silence. The syntax and rhythm shift appropriately to reflect the building tension of the ritual and the final, quiet release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and precise, poetic imagery ("ink had faded to the color of dried tears," "a cathedral after bells"). There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwriting. The language propels the narrative forward while simultaneously building a thick, immersive atmosphere, demonstrating complete mastery of line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core concept of "haunted firmware" translating baby cries into parental regrets is brilliantly inventive and emotionally potent. Its synthesis with an almost alchemical, ritualistic solution involving constellations and amber creates a story that feels entirely unique. This is a high-risk concept executed with confidence and artistic integrity, transforming a familiar guilt trope into something unforgettable.</comment>
