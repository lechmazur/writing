<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's defensive "mocking affection" and journey to "privately open" are clear and well-traced; however, the initial expression of his guardedness feels slightly less nuanced than the later revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc within the word limit, effectively driven by the character's internal quest; however, the "holographic yolk" coordinate reveal borders on overly convenient for a pivotal plot point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid and original world-building (e.g., "interstellar orchard ship," "cider nebulae") creates a unique, immersive atmosphere that strongly supports the narrative and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and thematic depth are evident, particularly regarding self-acceptance; the very high density of figurative language, however, occasionally risks overwhelming the narrative rather than purely enhancing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Demonstrates striking originality in concept and a distinctive poetic voice, with generally fresh metaphors ("kissing a mirror"); the pervasive stylistic richness, while individual, constantly tests the boundary of becoming overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The assigned elements are woven together with remarkable creative cohesion into a thematically resonant whole; the ambitious, highly concentrated style is largely successful but its sheer density demands significant reader focus and slightly impedes effortless absorption.</comment>
