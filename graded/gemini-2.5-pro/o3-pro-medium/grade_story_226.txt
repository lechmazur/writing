<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength in the "gloomy orchardist" identity being well-woven into her perspective and actions; weakness in "craftsman's pride" feeling like a momentary observation rather than a deep attribute, and the final altruistic shift is somewhat rapid given initial moral compromises.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc and effective pacing within the tight word limit, achieving a sense of completeness; however, the assigned concept of "craftsman's pride" has minimal impact on the overall plot's direction beyond a single, minor action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressive overall cohesion, skilfully weaving numerous disparate assigned elements into a resonant, imaginative, and emotionally poignant narrative that feels deliberate in its brevity and impact.</comment>
