<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters are more archetypal/functional than deeply developed; the narrator's internal "fractures" remain abstract, and the advisor is primarily a plot conduit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A coherent experiential arc is present, though the final revelations (e.g., reversing sunrise) feel like a rapid, somewhat abstract expansion of the initial mission's scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong; the "time-dilated zone" and "orchard of centuries" are vividly realized, with sensory details creating a palpable, integral atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and impactful imagery ("holographic" decay, "hieroglyphs of sap"); however, the relentless density of figurative language occasionally risks obscuring emotional nuance for poetic effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>A distinct, highly lyrical style, but marred by a notable textual oversight (repetition of "centuries-old coin" in close proximity) and prose that sometimes strains into the overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Creatively integrates its many assigned elements into a unique and thought-provoking narrative, but the stylistic intensity and minor textual flaws prevent "flawless" status for top-tier publication.</comment>
