<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The woodsman character is functional but lacks depth; his transition to truth-seeker feels abrupt, triggered too conveniently by his mother's death. The 'artfully messy' attribute connection is tenuous and superficial. Motivation is clear but lacks nuanced development within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses rapidly from A to B, achieving a basic arc. However, the method (echo measurement) strains credulity, and the resolution feels somewhat rushed. Coherence is maintained, but the cause-effect chain relies on convenient discoveries rather than organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The 'radio wave garden' setting is evocative and well-integrated, creating a strong atmosphere of decay and hidden signals. Sensory details like ozone and static are effective. The contrast between the hospital and the industrial decay works reasonably well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story employs symbolism (hairbrush, tracks) and decent imagery ("iron flowers"). However, the emotional impact is hampered by stated emotions ("despairing cheer") rather than purely shown nuance. The ending provides closure but lacks profound resonance. The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (disappeared parent, hidden conspiracy) without significant subversion. The echo measurement and hairbrush short-circuit feel contrived. Some phrasing ("despairing cheer braided like tracks") borders on purple prose. Lacks a truly unique voice or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements within the tight constraint; some feel forced (echo measurement, 'artfully messy'). While showing ambition, it doesn't fully transcend feeling like an exercise in combining prompts. Lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication.</comment>
