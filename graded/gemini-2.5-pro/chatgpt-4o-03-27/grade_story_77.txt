<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits (introverted empath) feel asserted rather than deeply demonstrated through action or internal monologue; motivation is clear but lacks strong internal grounding for Mira herself initially, feeling inherited from her brother.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While achieving a basic arc within the word limit, the plot resolution via the marionette's dance feels abrupt and overly symbolic, lacking sufficient build-up for its profound effect on the pirates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Strong initial setting description ("asteroid hideout") is significantly undermined by the near-total absence of the assigned tone ("drowsy enthusiasm"), making its inclusion feel arbitrary and disconnected from the prevailing mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of central symbolism (marionette, starfish) but occasionally hampered by slightly overwrought prose ("velvet dark," "obviously hidden wisdom") and reliance on stated concepts rather than fully earned emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells and combining elements interestingly, the story uses familiar tropes (lost sibling, magical artifact) and struggles to integrate awkward phrasing like "obviously hidden" naturally, hinting at constraint-driven writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Successfully incorporates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative, but the integration feels strained by weaker or awkwardly phrased prompts ("mountain wisdom," "obviously hidden," "drowsy enthusiasm"), hindering overall organic flow and impact.</comment>
