<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("embody his values, whatever that meant anymore") is present but feels vague and intellectually imposed rather than deeply felt. The transformation is abrupt, lacking sufficient internal grounding within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from setup (arrival) to action (ritual) to consequence (transformation), but the initiating method (discoloration) feels arbitrary and lacks narrative weight. The connection between the protest and the ritual remains tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting effectively creates atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details (rosemary, dust, moonlight). However, the "uniquely generic" darkness feels slightly conceptual rather than viscerally atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery ("eyes like extinguished stars," "spine of vines") and symbolism (mirror). The tone of "flippant solemnity" is well-executed. However, the central theme of embodying values feels somewhat asserted rather than fully explored through the narrative action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s and uses some fresh phrasing ("regret and rosemary"). The concept of "uniquely generic" darkness is original, though its execution borders on paradoxical. The writing style feels distinct, avoiding obvious AI patterns or purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story manages to weave most elements together, but the integration isn't seamless; the protest element, in particular, feels somewhat peripheral. The narrative feels slightly constrained by fitting the elements rather than flowing entirely organically from them.</comment>
