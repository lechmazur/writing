<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character portrayal feels somewhat superficial. "Impassive" and "personally impersonal" are stated but not deeply explored or convincingly demonstrated, especially given the tears at the climax which lack sufficient internal justification against the established impassivity. Motivation is clear but lacks strong grounding in the deputy persona beyond the acceptance of the fantastical premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, effectively using the 'stretch' action as a climax. However, the pacing feels slightly rushed, particularly the vision sequence, and the initial setup linking oil changes to bee communication feels abrupt and somewhat arbitrary, weakening the overall logical flow despite the internal consistency of the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core strength lies here. The setting is highly imaginative, evocative, and central to the story's unique atmosphere. Sensory details related to the orchard are effective. The tone of 'cautious bravery' aligns well with the exploration of the mystical setting and concept. The 'during oil changes' timeframe feels like the least integrated element, existing primarily as backstory justification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through vivid imagery and compelling symbolism (bees, orchard, grace). It successfully evokes wonder and presents a unique perspective. However, the impact is slightly lessened by telling character traits ("impassive") rather than consistently showing them, and the emotional core of the climactic vision feels observed rather than deeply experienced by the character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, avoiding predictable templates by blending disparate elements (deputy, bees, cathedral). Metaphors are generally fresh. However, some phrasing ("personally impersonal," "cautious bravery") feels slightly mannered or overly constructed. The handling of emotion remains somewhat surface-level, relying on stated traits and a climactic reaction (tears) that isn't fully reconciled with the established impassivity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable cohesion despite the eclectic mix of assigned elements, most of which feel purposeful within the narrative's unique logic. The imaginative combination and evocative atmosphere are significant strengths. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though minor weaknesses in character depth and the integration of one or two elements prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
