<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("anchor the ephemeral") is stated rather than deeply felt or demonstrated through nuanced action beyond placing the object. Echo-9 is conceptually interesting but its "uniformly peculiar" nature feels more like a label than a fully realized character trait influencing interactions. Lira remains somewhat passive, primarily reacting to Echo-9's interpretations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core action ("drain") via the wax method provides a clear structure for the central scene. However, the framing narrative ("eve of a bold discovery") feels disconnected from Lira's internal journey, weakening overall coherence and making the beginning/end connection feel slightly forced within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strongly evoked through sensory details (wax, ozone, candlelight) and effectively supports the "merry bitterness" tone and the therapy method. The immediate setting (chamber) is well-realized, though the broader "secret agent training facility" context is less developed. The timeframe ("eve of a bold discovery") feels extraneous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (charger, wax shapes) and evocative language creates impact. The central conflict of confronting past trauma is clear. However, the ending with the "perfect square" feels slightly too neat, potentially simplifying the complex process of dealing with trauma. The theme of memory and resilience is evident but relies heavily on Echo-9's pronouncements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concepts (hive-mind therapist, wax decoding) offer significant originality. While the language is generally fresh, some phrases ("whispering of missions gone wrong," "sealed with silence") verge on familiar tropes. Emotion is conveyed more through atmosphere and symbolic action than deep character interiority, avoiding simplistic statements but lacking profound nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements serviceably, particularly the therapist, object, and method within the central scene. The core concept is creative. However, the cohesion is marred by the poorly integrated timeframe ("bold discovery"), which feels tacked on rather than essential, slightly undermining the sense that the length is a deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
