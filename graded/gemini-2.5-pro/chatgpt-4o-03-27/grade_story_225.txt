<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (tracking butterflies for patterns) feels slightly arbitrary for an apothecary, though his past adds intrigue. Lys's character is underdeveloped, serving primarily as a romantic counterpart. The 'unjustly fair' attribute feels applied rather than organically arising from character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from observation to communication to warning, driven by the Morse code method. However, the resolution (surfacing to 'infect' the world) feels abrupt and slightly underdeveloped given the build-up and word limit. Pacing is swift but sacrifices depth, particularly in the romance and crew dynamics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly realized and atmospheric, strongly supporting the 'battered marvel' tone and the core action/method (observation, Morse code via pipes). The 'between broken treaties' timeframe effectively contextualizes the retreat below. Sensory details are well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a unique, melancholic mood and uses symbolism effectively (butterflies, dry highlighter). The central conflict (finding meaning/connection amidst chaos) is clear. However, the emotional impact of the romance and the crew's transformation feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept is original, blending steampunk, biology, and coded communication. However, some phrasing ("heart stitched from regrets," "love, like infection") borders on overly stylized or potentially clich√©. The rapid development of the romance via Morse code leans towards a familiar trope without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, albeit brief, narrative. The style is generally strong and evocative. While constrained, the length highlights a specific moment of discovery and decision. The core idea of communication transcending conventional means is creative and resonant.</comment>
