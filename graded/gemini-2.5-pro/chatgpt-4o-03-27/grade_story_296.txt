<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains largely an archetype; the 'hatefully adored' dynamic lacks sufficient demonstration through interaction or internal conflict, rendering Kiro more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc but relies heavily on mystical convenience for progression; the crew's shift from mockery to awe feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong initial atmosphere effectively uses the setting for contrast, but the submarine environment itself isn't explored with enough specific sensory detail beyond serving as a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effectively employs symbolism (chopsticks, cookbook) and establishes a clear theme, but the ultimate impact on the crew remains abstract ("changed in ways they couldnâ€™t name"), slightly undermining the 'show, don't tell' principle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept offers originality, some phrasing ("hatefully adored," "eyes held galaxies") and the mystical resolution lean towards familiar tropes, lacking truly surprising or nuanced execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive vignette, but the piece ultimately feels somewhat slight, prioritizing concept and atmosphere over deeper narrative resonance or character complexity.</comment>
