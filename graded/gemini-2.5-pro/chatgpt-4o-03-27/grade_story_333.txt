<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (preserving traditions) is clear and drives actions. However, the "sincere rebel" attribute feels somewhat asserted rather than fully demonstrated through nuanced action or voice; the characterization relies heavily on internal monologue and exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, but the assigned action "theorize" is used merely as character exposition ("She theorized that fear...") rather than actively driving the narrative forward. Pacing is adequate, coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent integration of setting ("haunted secret passage"), timeframe ("between storms"), and atmosphere. Sensory details effectively establish mood, supporting the character's motivation and the story's themes of memory and decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sticky note, names on stone) and effective evocation of mood. The theme of remembering/preserving is clear and consistent. Craft is generally high, though some emotional states are stated directly rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The writing avoids obvious AI pitfalls but lacks a truly distinctive voice or groundbreaking originality. Some phrasing ("pressed like a held breath," "erosion of...") feels competent but familiar. Metaphors are functional but not exceptionally fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The elements are woven together cohesively, serving the narrative well. The brief length feels purposeful, focusing on a single moment of quiet defiance. It demonstrates thoughtful combination but doesn't quite reach the level of unforgettable impact required for the highest tier.</comment>
