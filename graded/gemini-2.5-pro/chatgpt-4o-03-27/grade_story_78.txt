<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and tied to the sister/spyglass, but the 'late-blooming hero' attribute feels asserted rather than fully demonstrated within the narrative's scope. 'Softly militant' is effectively, if subtly, portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot coheres atmospherically, but the assigned action 'coerce' is used only abstractly and doesn't drive events. The 'scouring attics' method effectively leads to the key object, providing structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vividly rendered and intrinsically linked to the character's actions and the story's melancholic, searching atmosphere. Sensory details are effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance regarding loss and understanding; effective use of symbolism (spyglass, farm). The central conflict is internal and well-suited to the length, creating thoughtful impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While possessing a distinct voice, some phrasing ("constellations of loss and gravity," "celestial architecture") borders on overly stylized or purple prose. Core tropes are handled with sensitivity but aren't radically subverted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive, melancholic mood, integrating most elements well, particularly the spyglass and setting. The brief length feels appropriate for this contemplative vignette, leaving a lingering sense of quiet purpose.</comment>
