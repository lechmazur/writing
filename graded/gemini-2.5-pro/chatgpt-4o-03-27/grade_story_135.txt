<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (loyalty, dialects), but the 'ambitious brewer' trait feels superficial and disconnected from the core linguistic quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but relies on a passive core action ('withstand') and a highly improbable method (bruise deciphering).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are combined creatively, but minor weaknesses in character integration and plot mechanics prevent seamless cohesion required for top-tier publication.</comment>
