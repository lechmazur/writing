<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'exorcist with stage fright' concept is intriguing but underdeveloped; the stage fright is mentioned then seemingly overcome too easily, lacking impact. Motivation is clear, but the character's internal conflict feels shallow for the gravity implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent (approach, entry, climax) and the key turning action drives the conclusion effectively within the word limit. However, the central conflict (confronting lies) is established but not resolved, ending on potential rather than completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of orbital debris/space station with pressed wildflowers and toy assembly lines creates a unique and evocative atmosphere. Sensory details ("ambient temperature dropped," "mechanical whispers") enhance the mood effectively, strongly supporting the concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wildflowers, toys) and a clear theme of confronting generational trauma. The writing craft is generally good, but leans towards stating themes ("transform the weight of inherited silence") rather than purely showing them. Impact is intellectual more than deeply emotional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The sci-fi/familial exorcism blend offers originality. However, some phrasing ("calcified into a toxic inheritance," "narrative reborn, defiant and unafraid") borders on clich√© or overly literary abstraction. Emotional nuance feels stated rather than deeply inhabited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The elements are integrated reasonably well, creating a cohesive if slightly overwritten piece. The core concept is strong, but the execution feels somewhat constrained, ending just as the primary action (unveiling the truth) begins. It hints at depth but doesn't fully deliver within the word count.</comment>
