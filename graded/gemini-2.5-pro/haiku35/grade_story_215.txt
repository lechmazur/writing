<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'rattled exorcist' aspect feels asserted rather than demonstrated; her actions align more with a standard investigator. 'Inwardly social' is stated but doesn't significantly impact observable behaviour or choices within this short piece. Motivation is clear but lacks deep integration into her immediate actions beyond the puzzle-solving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure (clue -> puzzle -> reveal) is coherent and effectively driven by the puzzle method. It achieves a sense of completeness within the word count, moving from setup to resolution. Pacing is adequate, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting works well, but the 'amid dance lessons' timeframe feels somewhat arbitrary, providing atmospheric contrast but little narrative necessity. Sensory details are present ("sterile corridor," "sepia-toned image," "echoed distantly") but lack exceptional vividness or specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (postcard, puzzle pieces) effectively. The central conflict (unlocking the room) is clear and resolved. However, the theme of entwining science and wonder is explicitly stated rather than subtly woven. Showing vs. telling leans towards telling, particularly regarding character traits and motivations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (hidden room, mysterious artifacts, science vs. supernatural). Phrases like "whisper secrets," "intricate puzzle," and "threshold between known and unknown" feel somewhat clich√©. The "coy aggression" feels tacked on and inconsistent with the described internal processing. Emotional description ("rattled nerves now calm") is stated directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but some (exorcist background, dance lessons, coy aggression) feel less organically integrated than others (postcard, puzzle, setting). The narrative serves the elements reasonably well, but the brief length highlights the challenge of making every component feel essential and deeply connected.</comment>
