<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'lovingly detached' attribute is stated multiple times but insufficiently demonstrated through nuanced action or internal conflict; the swordsman aspect feels largely symbolic and disconnected from the primary collage-making activity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit simple, arc driven by the collage assembly. Coherence is maintained, but the transition to 'prophecy' feels slightly abrupt within the tight constraint. Pacing is adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center setting is effectively evoked and contrasts well with the historical/tactile nature of the collage and sea pottery, enhancing the theme of memory vs. progress. Sensory details are present but could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (recycling, pottery, sword) and a clear theme of narrative preservation create intellectual impact. The craft shows promise with evocative imagery, though the emotional resonance is somewhat muted by the character's detachment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core concept is relatively original, blending disparate elements. However, some phrasing feels slightly formulaic ("precisely because," "narrative that had been systematically erased"), and the character's detachment borders on generic coolness rather than deeply explored nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements reasonably well, particularly the setting, object, and action. The core theme is clear and the vignette format suits the length. The swordsman element feels the least integrated into the immediate narrative action.</comment>
