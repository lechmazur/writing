<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'seasoned woodsman' attribute feels underdeveloped; the character acts more like a technician. While motivation (mapping railways linked to sister) is clear, the connection to the 'honesty' concept feels abstract and abruptly introduced rather than organically arising from character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (search -> discovery) within the word limit. The method (radio receiver/water tower echo) is functional, but the 'short-circuit' action feels underutilized. The link between the hospital memory and the present action is present but lacks deep integration into the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The 'radio wave garden' setting is vividly imagined and atmospheric ('artfully messy', 'electromagnetic whispers'). The connection between the object (hairbrush) and setting (conduit) is intriguing. The 'despairing cheer' tone is stated but could be more deeply woven into the sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story uses evocative imagery (railways like veins) and explores themes of loss and connection. The ending provides a sense of resolution. However, the 'honesty' theme feels explicitly stated rather than shown, weakening its impact. The central conflict is clear but resolved somewhat conveniently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept (electromagnetic archaeology of grief) is original and avoids common tropes. Language is mostly purposeful, though phrases like "despairing cheer" risk feeling slightly overwrought. The blend of technology and emotion is distinctive, avoiding purely formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements reasonably well, particularly the setting, object, and method. However, the 'woodsman' trait and 'honesty' concept feel less integral, suggesting the story is somewhat constrained *by* the elements rather than seamlessly incorporating them. It shows creative thinking but lacks flawless cohesion.</comment>
