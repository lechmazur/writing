<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation (universal patterns) is clear and drives the plot, but her role as an "uneasy emissary" feels stated rather than demonstrated. The coathanger connection to redemption is explained rather than organically revealed through action or deeper introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from routine observation to potential discovery, driven by the debris's "consistently surprising" movement ("lurch"). The story achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the inciting incident feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital tracking station setting is effectively established with atmospheric details like the rustling postcards. The tone of "accidental wisdom" permeates the discovery. The coathanger feels slightly less integrated into the setting itself, more of a character prop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery (orbital ballet) and symbolism (patterns, coathanger as talisman). The story evokes wonder and intellectual curiosity, exploring themes of communication and discovery. The ending is purposeful, leaving the reader at a threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of debris communication is intriguing, but the prose occasionally dips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("elaborate dance of accidental wisdom," "trembled with the promise"). The coathanger/redemption symbolism feels somewhat generic and explicitly stated, lacking deep nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story generally feels cohesive, integrating most elements reasonably well, though the coathanger/redemption theme feels less organic than the core scientific discovery plotline. The brief length works, focusing tightly on the moment of potential contact.</comment>
