<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'disappointed archer' attribute feels largely metaphorical and underdeveloped, weakly connected to her core motivation as a documentarian. Her 'anxious calm' is stated rather than convincingly portrayed through action or internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot is minimal, essentially static observation and reflection triggered by the 'unplanned stop'. The 'confront' action is purely internal, lacking narrative drive. While coherent, it lacks a compelling arc or progression within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting (inverted waterfall) and timeframe (celestial alignment) are highly evocative and work synergistically to create a strong, unique atmosphere that effectively mirrors the character's internal state and thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (waterfall, comb) and a clear theme of hidden resilience. However, the reflective style lacks narrative tension, and the ending feels more like a restatement of purpose than a satisfying conclusion. Relies heavily on telling internal states.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central image is original, but the prose occasionally borders on overwrought ("intricate tapestry," "nuanced revolutions"). Some metaphors feel repetitive (waterfall = social movements). Emotional nuance is stated ("anxious calm," "passionate disinterest") rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated, though the archer aspect feels extraneous. The story successfully establishes mood and theme but sacrifices narrative momentum. It feels like a strong vignette but lacks the completeness required for top-tier publication.</comment>
