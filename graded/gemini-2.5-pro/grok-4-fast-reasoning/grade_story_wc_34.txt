<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is established clearly and consistently ("as a balladeer who had always sung for the overlooked"), but its arrival feels more like a declared statement ("Her motivation ignited like a spark...") than a choice emerging from embodied internal conflict. While her actions align perfectly with her motives, the interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate it to top-tier characterization for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story presents a clean, legible causal structure under a Causal lens, moving from discovery to a decisive change at the climax. The closure, where the ghost is freed, is unambiguous and earned. The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe acts as a persistent constraint, effectively tightening the narrative and charging the final moments, satisfying the requirements for a very high score, though prose artifacts prevent it from reaching the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and highly functional, providing the canvas for the climax (weathered walls), the tools (luminescent pigments), and the story's core mood. The environment directly constrains and enables the protagonist's choices, particularly in how she uses the stone surfaces. The final image of the courtyard as a "beacon in the mist" shows the setting transformed by the story's action, making it integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating the ghost's needs—is signaled early and escalated effectively by the ticking clock of the storm. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution in a clear climax that pays a visible, albeit emotional, cost by transforming her from "seldom-heard" to heard. The pressure is coherent and builds to a satisfying and earned conclusion, showing a meaningful change in the protagonist's state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from the protagonist's core identity and her actions, rather than from direct statement. The story's final image of the transformed courtyard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of being unheard. The integration of character, action, and outcome creates a coherent and satisfying thematic arc without resorting to moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The point of view is stable and the voice has a distinct lyrical texture, but it is hampered by repetition. The reuse of phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" feels like a textual artifact rather than a deliberate stylistic choice, slightly flattening the voice's uniqueness and control. While the prose is ambitious, these recursions detract from its overall effectiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but suffers from overwriting and repetitive artifacts. Phrases like "driftingly alert" are used as a label-like loop, and the sentence structures can be overly dense, slowing momentum. This density and repetition, especially of key thematic phrases, measurably dulls the impact of an otherwise strong story, representing its most significant area for improvement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of disparate elements—a fantasy balladeer, a coded ghost, a steampunk artifact, and graffiti art—is highly original and compelling. The story transforms familiar tropes into a fresh and memorable concept. While the line-level execution has flaws, the core vision and the ingenuity of its premise are exceptional, offering a non-obvious and engaging narrative.</comment>
