<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation to uncover the truth is strong, but the "forgotten noble" aspect feels more like an ornament than a core driver of his actions. The "obligation to remember" is stated, not deeply felt in the prose until the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally well-structured for the word count, with the incoming texts serving as a brilliant pacing device that builds tension. The narrative arc from discovery to decision is clear and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is superb. The imagery of a scorched, abandoned lab, pierced by the high-tech drone and an impossible fluorescent light, creates a potent and memorable mood that perfectly supports the story's themes of memory and decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's craft is its greatest strength, particularly the powerful symbolism of the drone (untainted memory), the stubs (fragmented truth), and the final match (combustive revelation). The ending is resonant and purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original premise and execution. However, the phrase "mysteriously obvious" is a writerly crutch that feels synthetically clever, slightly breaking the otherwise immersive prose and hinting at an authorial shortcut rather than organic observation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An impressive and cohesive piece that skillfully integrates most of its disparate elements into a tight, atmospheric narrative. It feels deliberate and deep, leaving a lasting impression despite minor weaknesses in the full integration of one or two prompts.</comment>
