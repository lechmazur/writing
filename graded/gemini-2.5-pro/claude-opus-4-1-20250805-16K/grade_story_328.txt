<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While competently written, the narrative follows a predictable "trapped-in-VR" template and relies on common genre clich√©s (memory as the key) without sufficient subversion or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story shows impressive technical skill in cohesively integrating its many required elements, but this mechanical precision makes the narrative feel more like a well-solved puzzle than an organic work of art.</comment>
