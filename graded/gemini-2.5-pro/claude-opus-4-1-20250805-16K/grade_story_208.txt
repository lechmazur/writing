<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is a compelling sketch, but the guard's attribute, "complexly deceptive," is a critical flaw. It's stated but never demonstrated; his final lines portray him as a kindred spirit, directly contradicting the label and leaving a significant character element feeling arbitrary and unresolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The emotional arc is complete and effective for a vignette. However, the plot mechanism of the landlord changing the locks feels like a convenient, last-minute exposition dump to force the character's situation, slightly cheapening the story's otherwise organic feel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The postal facility as a "cathedral of lost connections" is a masterful choice, with sensory details that perfectly externalize the internal themes of automated indifference and forgotten correspondence. The atmosphere is potent and inseparable from the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is largely superb, rich with symbolism (pen, suitcase) and potent imagery. The piece is marred by the guard's final line, "We sort everything here except our own lives," which is too on-the-nose, explicitly stating the theme the story had already beautifully implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central conceit is highly original, and the prose avoids clich√© for the most part. The narrative feels fresh and specific. The aforementioned issue with the guard's unearned attribute and his overly thematic dialogue are the only elements that hint at a formulaic need to tie things up neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive and resonant piece that uses its assigned elements in service of a powerful central idea. It functions perfectly at its brief length, achieving the feel of a deliberate, polished vignette. It leaves a lingering feeling, succeeding as a work of literary fiction despite minor flaws.</comment>
