<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's motivation is powerfully established, but the final character shift from a lifetime of duty-bound stoicism to integrated enlightenment happens too suddenly. The epiphany feels more intellectually summarized than emotionally earned in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is elegant and complete, using the recurring knocker as a brilliant framing device. However, the resolution—the literal transformation of the prison and disappearance of the door—is an abrupt shift into overt fantasy that feels slightly incongruous with the preceding psychological realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The fusion of the physical setting (lighthouse prison) with the psychological space (mirrored reflection) is seamless and deeply symbolic, creating a potent mood of haunted liminality. Every detail serves the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with powerful central symbolism. The impact is blunted by the final two paragraphs, which explicitly state the theme ("The knight understood then that..."). This 'telling' undermines the 'showing' that was so effective earlier, failing to trust the reader to grasp the subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story cleverly subverts the "duty vs. love" trope by integrating them, and the central metaphor is fresh. The weakness is the resolution, which feels like a predictable "epiphany" template, where complex trauma is resolved too neatly and cleanly in a single moment of understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a tight, resonant narrative. Its primary flaw, preventing it from reaching the highest tier, is a reliance on explaining its own theme at the conclusion rather than letting the potent imagery complete the work.</comment>
