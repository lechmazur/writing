<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina is a compelling sketch, but her core motivation feels more professional than personal; the captain's shift from hardened pirate to hopeful brother is too swift to be fully credible, making him more of a plot device than a character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is exceptionally tight and complete for the word count. However, the core conflict resolves with a suddenness that slightly undermines the established tension; the captain's capitulation feels more convenient than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is a masterclass in economy, juxtaposing the grime of the brig with the cosmic sublime. The details are specific and evocative ("diaries from the Great Exodus"), creating a deep sense of history and place with very few words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose is the story's greatest strength. The use of fresh, precise metaphor ("hope cracked his voice like lightning splitting stone") and potent symbolism (the chipped die) elevates the narrative into literary territory. The ending is both conclusive and expansive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "psychic genealogist" concept is highly original, and its fusion with a space opera setting feels fresh. While using a "gruff exterior, pained interior" archetype, the unique context and high-level prose prevent it from feeling clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, with every assigned element serving a crucial narrative and thematic function. It feels deliberate and artful, achieving a powerful emotional resonance that lingers well beyond its brief length. A standout piece.</comment>
