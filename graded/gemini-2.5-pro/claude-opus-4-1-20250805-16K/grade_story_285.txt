<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character feels more like a functional archetype than a nuanced individual; his internal journey from hesitant to purposeful is explained rather than organically embodied, making him a vessel for the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear for the word count, but the resolution—filing evidence in "living memory"—is conceptually abstract and lacks a tangible, satisfying narrative impact, weakening the story's conclusion.</comment>
