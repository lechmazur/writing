<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is more of a highly competent functionary for the plot than a fully realized person. Her defining trait, "uniquely literal," is well-executed, but her personality ("bright-eyed," "brazen calm") is stated more than it is deeply inhabited, leaving her feeling slightly thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and logical for its length, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. The causality is clear and the pacing is excellent, though the convenience of the ghosts' help and the notes' exact function leans into expediency over organic discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a post-apocalyptic water-scarce future with a haunted, anachronistic lighthouse is the story's greatest strength. The atmosphere is rich and specific, with every element of the setting serving a distinct, meaningful purpose in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly in its use of symbolism (the obsolete key, the water-bearer constellation) and its ability to convey a grand, world-saving conflict through a small, focused scene. The central theme of finding literal truth in the metaphorical past is potent and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality by blending disparate genres (ghost story, sci-fi, espionage) into a cohesive whole. The core conceit—ghosts assisting with interstellar communication—is fresh, and the prose avoids cliché in favor of specific, evocative imagery like "memories of rain."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkable cohesion, skillfully weaving its many required elements into a narrative that feels intentional and elegant. The elements serve the story, not the other way around, resulting in a piece that is resonant and feels complete despite its brevity.</comment>
