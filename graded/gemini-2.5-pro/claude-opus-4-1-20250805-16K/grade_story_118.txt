<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is an intriguing concept, but her characterization is almost entirely expositional. The 'uniformly peculiar' attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated, and Morrison is a stock grieving agent, making the emotional core feel more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is a clean, procedural arc that functions well within the word count, but its straightforward A-to-B-to-C structure lacks subtlety or surprise. It's competent, but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the core concept creates a unique mood, the 'secret agent facility' setting feels like generic window dressing. The story fails to meaningfully integrate its fantastical elements with the supposed grit of its spy-fi world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's central conceit and its symbolic execution are highly original and impactful. However, it occasionally undermines its own craft by explicitly explaining its symbolism, distrusting the reader to connect the dots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concepts are commendably unique, but the narrative structure relies on familiar beats, such as the mentor explicitly stating the story's theme. It feels more like a clever assembly of original parts than a truly organic, surprising whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story exhibits impressive technical cohesion, skillfully weaving its disparate elements. However, the emotional arc is simplistic and the resolution overly tidy, making the piece feel more like a clever conceptual exercise than a profound narrative.</comment>
