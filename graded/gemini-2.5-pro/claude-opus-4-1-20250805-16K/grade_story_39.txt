<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is a model of economy, achieving a complete and satisfying arc within the word count. The central action, 'reverberate', is not merely included but serves as the critical, logical pivot for the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is exceptionally well-realized; the setting elements (scarred biodome, water-damaged books) are not passive backdrops but are fundamentally integrated into the story's central technology and atmosphere.</comment>
