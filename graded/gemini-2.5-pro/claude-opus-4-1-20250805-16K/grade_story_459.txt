<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's core concept and motivation are exceptionally strong and well-integrated. The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute, while present, feels slightly more stated than organically woven into the entirety of her being, a minor contrivance in an otherwise nuanced portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The internal plot arc is superb for this length, achieving a full emotional resolution. However, the specified 'method' of staking out ghost tours is merely mentioned as backstory and does not drive the present action, feeling like a tacked-on requirement rather than an integral plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The primary setting is brilliantly original and thematically resonant. The contrast between the sterile, quiet lab and the haunted, singing elevator shafts creates a powerful atmospheric engine that drives the story's central metaphor. The world feels both specific and symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The craft is of the highest caliber. The central metaphor is potent and sustained, the symbolism is layered without being overwrought, and the final lines deliver a profound, earned emotional and intellectual impact. The piece demonstrates a masterful control of theme and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is startlingly original, combining disparate concepts into a cohesive and unique narrative. It skillfully subverts ghost story tropes in favor of a quiet, melancholic exploration of empathy. The voice and execution feel entirely authentic and author-driven, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An outstanding piece of flash fiction that weaves its elements into a cohesive, poignant whole. It transcends its constraints to feel deliberate and deep, leaving a lingering emotional resonance. Its only significant flaw is the perfunctory inclusion of one plot element, which slightly mars an otherwise near-flawless execution.</comment>
