<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character concept is strong and well-realized symbolically, but her internal journey from considering flight to embracing her role feels slightly rushed, making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a fully nuanced individual in the brief space provided.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and complete arc within the word limit, but the central conflict (leave vs. stay) is resolved philosophically almost as soon as it's introduced, which slightly lessens the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's most significant strength. The "acid rain forest" is rendered with specific, potent, and deeply atmospheric sensory details that are perfectly integrated with the story's character and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, particularly the use of prose and powerful, consistent symbolism. However, the final line of dialogue states the theme a bit too explicitly, slightly undermining the subtle "show, don't tell" approach that otherwise dominates the piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is highly original, subverting post-apocalyptic tropes with a quiet, philosophical focus. The voice is distinct and the imagery is fresh, avoiding clich√© with the minor exception of the phrase "ember of choice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An evocative and cohesive piece where the elements serve the narrative beautifully. It demonstrates profound creative thinking and leaves a lingering emotional impact. It is a hair's breadth from flawless, held back only by a few moments of thematic over-explicitness.</comment>
