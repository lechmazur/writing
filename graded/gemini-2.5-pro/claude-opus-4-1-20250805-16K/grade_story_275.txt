<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is a functional archetype for the theme but lacks a distinct voice or personal depth. The motivation is clear, but the assigned attribute "theoretically rebellious" is an awkward, intellectual label for what is presented as a deeply intuitive and practical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear and satisfying arc, but the pacing of the resolution—shoots emerging in a matter of hours—is jarringly fast and undermines the "deliberate" tone. The repetitive use of the phrase "Throughout moving" feels like a structural tic rather than a polished narrative choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The fusion of the "ghostly orchard" and the "burning comet" creates a potent, spectral mood, which is expertly rendered through specific sensory details like "scorched grass" and soil "cold for three winters."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly the central symbolism of translating celestial light via broken objects. However, the impact is slightly blunted by moments of telling over showing (e.g., explicitly stating her notion was "rebellious" or her choices "mindful") where inference would be more powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is highly original, the execution shows signs of formulaic construction. The triple repetition of the transitional phrase "Throughout moving" is a significant flaw that reads as algorithmic. The narrative logic is almost too neat, lacking the messiness of human discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable creativity in weaving its disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant whole. Its primary weakness is a lack of final polish; awkward phrasing and a rushed climax prevent it from reaching the flawless standard required for immediate publication in a top-tier journal.</comment>
