<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's core trait ("overzealous") is a clever lynchpin for the plot's resolution, but Mika herself remains more of a functional archetype than a deeply rendered individual. Her internal journey feels prescribed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a satisfying arc, but its progression relies on overly convenient "chance encounters" that serve as undisguised exposition, sacrificing narrative subtlety for mechanical efficiency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional and evocative; the central image of the highway orchard is memorable and potent. The "no dreams" concept adds a powerful, melancholic layer, though its implications remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's central metaphor—the orchard as an acoustic instrument—is brilliantly executed. The craft is strong, but marred by functional, non-naturalistic dialogue that exists only to convey information.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept is highly original and fresh, skillfully avoiding genre clichés. The combination of post-apocalyptic rewilding, acoustic architecture, and forgotten deities feels singular and inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A remarkably cohesive and resonant piece where the elements serve a unified, powerful theme. It achieves a sense of wonder and leaves a lingering impression, succeeding despite a few minor mechanical flaws.</comment>
