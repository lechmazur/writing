<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's core attribute (mathematically challenged) is brilliantly integrated as a metaphor for her fragmented identity, but her foundational motivation for becoming a dream thief feels slightly underdeveloped, relying on a brief, potentially post-hoc rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and effective for flash fiction, creating a complete and resonant arc. However, the prosecutor's ability to recognize a stolen "muscle memory" requires a significant logical leap, even within the story's fantastical context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted, with the setting and timeframe creating a palpable sense of lonely, post-human stillness. The world-building is evocative, though the introduction of the "last human" feels like a glimpse into a larger, underdeveloped mythology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is superb, with rich, consistent symbolism and an impactful final line. The central conflict is clear and the resolution is thematically powerful. The "show, don't tell" principle is expertly applied to convey the character's internal state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is highly original, combining disparate concepts into a unique and memorable narrative. It successfully avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, presenting a fresh take on the "fragmented self" theme with language that feels specific and authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements into a seamless and impactful whole. The brief length feels deliberate and powerful. Its only minor flaw is a reliance on a few points of narrative convenience to connect key plot points.</comment>
