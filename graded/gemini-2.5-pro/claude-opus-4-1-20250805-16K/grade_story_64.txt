<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's core actions are resolute and decisive, which directly contradicts the assigned attribute "uncertain." While her motivations are clear, this fundamental disconnect between her label and her portrayal is a significant flaw in an otherwise well-realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is nearly flawless for its length, achieving a complete and satisfying arc. The use of the verdict as a framing device is masterful, allowing for efficient exposition and a powerful climax. The pacing is impeccable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are exceptionally rendered. The floating marketplace is not just a backdrop but a powerful, integrated metaphor for the story's theme. Sensory details are specific, and the tone of "mundane miracles" is maintained with remarkable consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates superior craft, using symbolism (the untethered market, the cracked scale) and subtext to explore its theme with depth and nuance. The central conflict is internal and compelling, and the resolution is both earned and thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>While the "immortality is a curse" theme is not new, its execution is highly original. The unique combination of setting, method, and a quiet, personal resolution feels fresh and distinctive. The prose is elegant and purposeful, avoiding clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is a model of cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a seamless and impactful whole.
