<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "never tardy" attribute is mentioned twice but is narratively inert; it adds nothing to the plot or character's methods, feeling like a superfluous label rather than a meaningful trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot progression relies on extreme conveniences, particularly discovering passwords on discarded airplanes. This undermines the protagonist's meticulousness and makes the resolution feel too easy and contrived for a top-tier thriller.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the setting is original and thematically linked, the atmosphere is more described than felt. The facility lacks sufficient sensory detail to feel like a tangible space beyond its function as a stage for the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating key emotional shifts ("sardonic glee finally giving way to grief") instead of allowing them to emerge purely through action and subtext, which flattens the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central conceit is highly original, but it's scaffolded by tired tropes: the conveniently careless villain (passwords on paper) and the "uploaded to WikiLeaks" finale, which reads as a predictable, modern deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story feels like a remarkably clever solution to a writing prompt. The elements are combined skillfully, but their cohesion feels engineered rather than organic, preventing the narrative from transcending its mechanical origins.</comment>
