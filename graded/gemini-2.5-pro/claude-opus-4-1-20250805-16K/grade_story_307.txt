<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a symbolic vessel for the theme than a nuanced individual. Her motivation is stated directly ("The old guard of cynicism ruled...But Maya understood") rather than revealed organically, which lessens its impact and makes her feel slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story possesses a remarkably complete and satisfying arc for its length. The pacing is masterful, moving from macro to micro and back again. The only minor weakness is the slightly tenuous connection between the scratched DVD's rhythm and the actual flickering of the signs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its atmosphere. The tone of "ethereal grit" is perfectly realized through potent, specific imagery ("confetti settled...like dead stars," "methodical erasure of joy"). The setting and timeframe are not just a backdrop but are integral to the story's central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, with a powerful central metaphor and resonant subtext. However, it relies on telling the reader the central conflict and the character's role ("She was the neighborhood's spirited guardian") instead of trusting the otherwise excellent "showing" to carry the full narrative weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—a revolution fought with fairy lights and neon affirmations—is highly original and subverts the typical rebellion trope. The prose is stylish and distinct, avoiding cliché and creating fresh, memorable metaphors ("dead lights like a defeated flag").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An evocative and skillfully constructed piece that succeeds in its ambition. The elements are woven together with near-perfect cohesion. It falls just shy of flawless due to a slight over-reliance on direct thematic statements, which a final polish could render more subtle.</comment>
