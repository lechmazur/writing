<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The 'shy' attribute is stated ("shy mind") but feels underdeveloped and somewhat at odds with the character's immense power and decisive action; the internal conflict between the trait and the duty is not fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete and coherent within the word count, but the discovery/investigation phase is conveyed through summary ("She recognized the pattern") rather than shown, slightly accelerating the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the underwater setting, the temporal concept, and the melancholy tone is the story's greatest strength, creating a tangible, deeply resonant, and thematically perfect atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's central moral dilemma is profoundly impactful and is supported by superb literary craft ("letters to dead addresses"), though the ending's impact relies more on the stated consequences than on a deeply felt internal resolution from the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core conceit—detecting timeline fractures through social media—is exceptionally original, subverting genre tropes and grounding a high-concept sci-fi/fantasy idea in a fresh, contemporary context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and creative story where all elements serve a singular, powerful theme. It demonstrates near-publishable quality, held back only by the slight disconnect in the character's primary attribute.</comment>
