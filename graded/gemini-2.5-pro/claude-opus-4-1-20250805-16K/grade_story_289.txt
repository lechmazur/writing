<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is more of an archetypal vessel for the plot than a character with discernible depth. Her "awkwardness" feels like an applied trait rather than an organic part of her personality, and her internal world remains entirely unexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies on an unearned deus ex machina. The central obstacle (the drone) is dismissed with a single line of bureaucratic jargon, and the final civilization appears instantly, removing any sense of earned discovery or struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's strongest feature is its atmosphere. The juxtaposition of a high-tech future with organic, ancient mystery is evocative and the setting is well-realized, doing most of the work to create a sense of wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story telegraphs its theme instead of allowing the reader to experience it. The final sentence, in particular, over-explains the central idea, undermining the subtext and demonstrating a lack of confidence in the narrative's own power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is novel, the execution falls back on familiar tropes: the lone scholar who understands the past better than her contemporaries, and the hyper-advanced, peaceful hidden race. The prose contains several stock phrases ("cascading light") that dull its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is a competent and clever exercise in prompt-fulfillment, but it lacks genuine narrative tension. It reads like a beautiful, self-contained vignette where the conclusion is foregone, ultimately feeling more intellectually neat than emotionally resonant or artistically necessary.</comment>
