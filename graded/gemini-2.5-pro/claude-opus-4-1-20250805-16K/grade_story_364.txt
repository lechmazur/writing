<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character serves as an effective lens for the story's concept but lacks a distinct voice or internal complexity; her acceptance of impossible phenomena feels more like a plot necessity than a developed psychological reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is logical and achieves a complete arc, but the pacing is rushed. The narrative makes huge conceptual leaps in very little space, making major revelations feel unearned and more like a summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength, effectively blending the scientific setting with the artisanal, mystical discoveries. The tone of "mundane miracles" is well-established and supported by tangible, evocative details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's thematic depth and the originality of its central metaphors are its greatest assets. However, it leans too heavily on stating its conclusions directly rather than allowing the reader to infer them through action and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise, which combines temporal physics, botany, and disappearing crafts, is exceptionally original and avoids common tropes. The narrative feels fresh and demonstrates a unique authorial vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is a highly cohesive and imaginative proof-of-concept, let down primarily by the narrative compression required by its length. The idea is stronger than the execution, which feels more like a brilliant synopsis than a fully realized story.</comment>
