<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character's central conflict—exorcist with stage fright—is a compelling hook, but its resolution is too abrupt. The transition from "voice cracked" to "steadier now" and the complete dissolution of her fright feels told rather than earned, lacking the nuanced psychological struggle expected for publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and complete arc, which is commendable for the word count. However, the plot structure is formulaic and the central conflict with the demon is resolved too quickly and easily, which significantly lowers the stakes and the sense of accomplishment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's strongest feature. The juxtaposition of cold, dead orbital debris with the organic, terrestrial magic of wildflowers creates a potent and memorable atmosphere. The imagery of dead satellites as an audience is particularly effective and elevates the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>There is strong symbolic craft (flowers vs. void, toys as hope), but the impact is blunted by telling instead of showing the emotional climax ("her stage fright dissolved"). The demon's dialogue is a generic taunt, missing an opportunity for more specific, unsettling psychological warfare.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept of a sci-fi exorcist using Earth botany is brilliantly original. However, the execution relies on a very familiar narrative template: a hero confronts a manifestation of their fear and overcomes it. The originality of the components is not quite matched by the originality of the plot's architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece is remarkably cohesive, weaving its disparate elements into a functional whole. Its ambition is clear. However, it feels like a high-quality proof-of-concept that solves its internal and external conflicts too neatly, lacking the grit, ambiguity, or lasting resonance required for a top-tier publication.</comment>
