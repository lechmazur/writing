<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is more of a thematic vessel than a deeply nuanced individual. Core attributes like "fiercely gentle" are stated more than they are compellingly demonstrated through varied action, making her feel slightly underdeveloped beyond her role in the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly constructed with a clear, resonant arc that is perfectly suited to the word count. The inciting incident (notepad) logically propels the narrative to its thematic resolution, demonstrating excellent coherence and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength, creating a highly evocative and memorable atmosphere. The blending of the sterile vacuum of space with the living, memory-filled garden is masterful and central to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the prose is often beautiful and the symbolism is potent, the craft is weakened by moments of "telling" emotion ("were overwhelming") and a tendency toward sentimentality, particularly in the final paragraph ("mixed her tears with the pigments").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's concept is a fresh synthesis of familiar ideas, but authenticity is undermined by a few clich√©d ("leap of faith") or overly poetic phrases ("signed the painting with dirt from Earth and starlight from beyond") that feel more writerly than genuine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally cohesive, weaving its assigned elements into an organic whole. However, its high polish and earnest sentimentality, while appealing, lack the friction or raw unpredictability that would elevate it from very good to undeniably exceptional.</comment>
