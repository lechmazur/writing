<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character is a compelling archetype, but lacks the psychological depth or surprising internal conflict required for top-tier literary fiction; she is too perfectly suited for her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot progression is logical but hinges on a "deus ex machina" button that conveniently solves the protagonist's exact problem, making the resolution feel unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on familiar tropes (the noble renegade, the all-powerful artifact) without offering significant subversion, feeling more like a repackaging than an original creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the piece is cohesive and atmospheric, its conventional, frictionless plot and archetypal character prevent it from achieving the distinction required for this level of publication.</comment>
