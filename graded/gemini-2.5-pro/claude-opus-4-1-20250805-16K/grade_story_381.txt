<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character is a well-designed vehicle for the plot, with interesting traits that serve the narrative's unique mechanics. However, she lacks a deeper internal life beyond her function, making her feel more like a collection of concepts than a fully realized person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length. The core mechanism (using films to organize ghosts) is a creative and effective driver of the narrative. The pacing is masterful, achieving a complete arc efficiently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's most significant achievement. The synthesis of a crystalline cave and a buried cinema is both visually and conceptually stunning, creating a unique and memorable atmosphere that is absolutely integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with an intelligent central theme and clever use of subtext (e.g., specific film titles as warnings). The impact is more intellectual than emotional; the story is admired for its ingenuity but doesn't achieve a profound emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is remarkably original. The core conceit—a geologist-necromancer using shared cinematic taste to map a cave—is fresh, inventive, and executed with flourishes (like the Kubrick/Kurosawa debate) that feel distinctly human-authored and not algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and intelligent story where the required elements feel purposefully chosen for one another. It demonstrates exceptional creativity in its synthesis of genre and concept, leaving a strong, lingering impression. It is on the cusp of top-tier publication.</comment>
