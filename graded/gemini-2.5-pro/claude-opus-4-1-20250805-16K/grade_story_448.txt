<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is explicitly stated rather than felt, rendering her more of a functional cipher for the plot than a psychologically complex individual. Her defining attributes are told to the reader, not shown through nuanced action or inner thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a commendably complete and coherent narrative arc—setup, rising action, climax, and resolution—within the severe word constraint, with the character-driven inciting incident being a particular strength.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength; the concept of "soot alchemy" within a chimney sweep guild hall is exceptionally original, creating a rich, evocative atmosphere where the setting is integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies almost entirely on exposition. It tells the reader about the character, her methods, and the stakes, rather than immersing them through dramatized scenes. This lack of "showing" is a critical flaw for literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the central concept is highly original, the prose itself lacks a distinctive voice. The declarative, explanatory style feels more like a (well-written) summary or lore entry than a piece of authored fiction, dulling the impact of its inventiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A brilliant, high-concept premise is underserved by a prose style that is more functional and explanatory than literary. The story feels like an outline of a masterpiece rather than the masterpiece itself.</comment>
