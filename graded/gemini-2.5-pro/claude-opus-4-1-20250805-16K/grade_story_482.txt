<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Morrow’s motivation is clear, but her characterization feels thin. Key emotional states like her "frolicsome regret" and seven-day insomnia are stated rather than deeply inhabited, making her more of a functional narrative device than a fully realized person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendably complete arc within the word limit, but the climax is disappointingly brief. The Mayor's defeat is too swift and easy, lacking a final, tense moment of confrontation to make the resolution feel truly earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's triumph; the arboreal mushroom workshop is a fantastic, evocative setting. The primary weakness is the integration of the "frolicsome" tone, which appears as a single phrase at odds with the overwhelmingly grim and desperate atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with excellent use of symbolism (the hat) and a clear, impactful theme. However, the story relies on telling key backstory ("He'd discovered the truth too late...") which feels like an expository shortcut in an otherwise well-shown narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality. While the premise of soul-stealing art is a known trope, the unique execution—the mushroom setting, scrying method, and the specific twist of trapping *hunger*—feels fresh and imaginative, avoiding predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and imaginative piece that skillfully weaves its elements together. It falls just short of publishability due to a rushed climax and minor tonal inconsistency, feeling like an excellent draft that needs one more pass to sharpen its final, crucial moments.</comment>
