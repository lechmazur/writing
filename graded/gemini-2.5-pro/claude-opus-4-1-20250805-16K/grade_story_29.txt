<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core character attribute ("cleverly naive") is explicitly stated rather than demonstrated through action or subtext, a significant flaw that reads as a narrative shortcut and undermines the character's dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and coherent arc within the word count. The pacing is swift and purposeful, moving from setup to resolution without a single wasted moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The world and atmosphere are rendered with potent, specific sensory details (humming, aching teeth, gleaming fruit) that seamlessly integrate the setting, tone, and central concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the "Regret Engine" is powerful and the imagery is consistently strong. However, the craft is marred by the previously mentioned instance of "telling" instead of "showing," which holds it back from true excellence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>While built on a recognizable quest framework, the specific concept of the Regret Engine and its method of destruction are highly original. The metaphors feel fresh and specific, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements into a unified and resonant whole. It feels less like an exercise in fulfilling prompts and more like a singular, deliberate artistic vision.</comment>
