<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's core conflict—the tension between her fraudulent public life and her burdensome genuine gift—is compelling. The motivation is clear. However, her internal state of "peaceful anger" is more stated than demonstrated through action or difficult choice; her path is remarkably linear and unhesitating for someone supposedly furious with her gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent, with a clear and satisfying arc. The pacing is masterful for the word count. The only point of weakness is the curator's immediate compliance; it feels like a narrative convenience required by the length, slightly undermining the realism of the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph. The rain-swept Prague, the unmarked door, the dusty archive of dead languages—all work in perfect concert to support the theme and mood. The connection between the setting and the story's core mystery is seamless and deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the central metaphor of "planting languages." The story's impact is intellectual and profound. It falters only slightly on the final sentence, which feels like an unnecessary summary of a theme that the story had already beautifully implied, trading subtlety for directness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original. The premise avoids cliché by grounding the supernatural gift in a character who has profited from fraud, creating a nuanced emotional landscape. The prose is fresh and purposeful. The concept of linguistic creation via ritual is a genuinely novel and memorable idea that elevates the entire piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is a model of cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a narrative that feels both inevitable and surprising. The brevity is a strength, concentrating the story's power. It succeeds not just as a fulfillment of a prompt, but as a standalone piece of high-quality flash fiction that leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
