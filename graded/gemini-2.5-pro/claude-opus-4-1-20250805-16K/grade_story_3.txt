<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character is a strong archetype and his voice is distinct, but he functions more as a very effective vessel for the story's concept than as a character with deep internal nuance. His 'surliness' is stated more than demonstrated in a complex way.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and complete for its length, presenting a clear problem-and-resolution arc. The pacing is masterful. Its only minor weakness is the magnate's immediate, unquestioning acceptance of a supernatural solution, a convenience for the sake of brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The fusion of the graveyard setting, the liminal timeframe, and the core concept is the story's greatest strength. The atmosphere is thick, purposeful, and profoundly resonant, with the setting itself acting as a key thematic element (a library of expired data).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The craft is superb, built on an intelligent and sustained central metaphor. Lines like "information expires like fish" are memorable and potent. The story’s primary impact is intellectual, leaving a lingering philosophical impression. The ending verges slightly on 'telling' the theme, but it's a minor flaw in an otherwise masterful execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's originality is its defining feature. The synthesis of market theory, maritime mysticism, and knot-divination is fresh and compelling, avoiding genre clichés. The prose is distinct and purposeful, showing no signs of formulaic or machine-like construction. The narrative frame is familiar, but its contents are not.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An excellent, cohesive piece of flash fiction where all assigned elements serve a singular, powerful theme. The story feels deliberate and dense with meaning, achieving significant intellectual and atmospheric impact within a small space. Its focus is so intensely on its central conceit that character depth is slightly sacrificed, preventing it from reaching absolute perfection.</comment>
