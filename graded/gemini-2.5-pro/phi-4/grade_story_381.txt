<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The core assigned trait 'necromancer' is entirely absent from the character's actions, thoughts, or methods, rendering it completely superficial. Motivation (mapping) is clear but disconnected from the supposed necromancy. The character feels underdeveloped beyond the surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot is minimal, essentially pausing the main action (mapping) for reflection during a movie. The action 'dominate' is weakly interpreted as 'map'. While coherent, the structure lacks meaningful progression or conflict within the word count; the beginning, middle, and end are present but lack substance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is effectively evoked and works well with the solitary character and the mapping task. The 'futuristic nostalgia' tone is adequately established through the drone/old movies contrast, creating a distinct atmosphere. Sensory details related to light and sound are present.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on stating emotions ('sound of resolve') rather than showing them. Literary devices are present but not particularly impactful or original. The central conflict is vague and internal, lacking tension. The theme of purpose/exploration is clear but handled superficially. Overall craft is competent but lacks depth or strong emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The 'necromancer' element feels entirely tacked on, suggesting difficulty integrating disparate prompts rather than authorial choice. Phrases like 'sound of resolve' and 'futuristic nostalgia' are repeated and feel somewhat formulaic. While not overtly clich√©-ridden, the story lacks a truly unique voice or surprising interpretation of its elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is significantly hampered by the unintegrated 'necromancer' element. The story feels constructed *around* the elements (especially the setting and motivation) rather than using them organically. While the length suits the simple scene, the overall execution lacks the creative spark and depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
