<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated but feels somewhat imposed; the 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is mentioned but barely demonstrated or integrated into the core narrative events, weakening character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the 'staking out ghost tours' method feels entirely disconnected from the central discovery and resolution, creating a coherence issue. Pacing is adequate for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The 'sand castle preservation lab' setting offers initial intrigue but remains underdeveloped atmospherically; its unique aspects don't significantly influence the core interaction beyond providing a backdrop for an old elevator.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt," "understanding") rather than showing. While symbolism (crown) is present, the theme of finding peace in silence is delivered explicitly, lacking subtlety and deep resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable trope (finding peace via gentle ghost). Phrases like "symphony of silence" border on clich√©, and the emotional development feels formulaic rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Several assigned elements (clumsiness, ghost tours, specific setting details) feel superficially layered onto the core story rather than organically integrated, hindering overall cohesion and suggesting the constraints dictated the narrative path too obviously.</comment>
