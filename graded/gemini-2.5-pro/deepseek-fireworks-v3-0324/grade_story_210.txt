<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character is functional but lacks depth; "amiable" is stated but not demonstrated, and the "doubly singular" motivation feels abstract and somewhat imposed rather than organically arising from a distinct personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word count, but the resolution (writing a new story) feels slightly unearned and lacks specificity. The timeframe element ("waiting room once good news arrives") is confusingly integrated and disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric writing effectively uses the haunted lighthouse setting and sensory details (groaning timbers, shadows) to create mood, though the "waiting room" aspect feels disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story employs symbolism (crossword, lighthouse) and explores a clear theme, but relies too heavily on stating emotions and insights ("He felt a strange calm," "his understanding deepened") rather than showing them through action or nuanced internal thought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, introspective scholar) without significant subversion. Phrases like "whispers of the past" and the overall narrative arc feel somewhat predictable and lack a truly unique voice or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While cohesive in atmosphere, the integration of some elements (particularly "doubly singular" and the timeframe) feels forced. The story achieves a mood but lacks the striking originality and depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
