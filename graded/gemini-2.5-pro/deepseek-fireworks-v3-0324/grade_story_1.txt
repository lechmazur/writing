<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'phobia-ridden' aspect is central, but the 'stunt double' feels entirely superficial, adding little beyond an ironic label. Motivation ("dance on the edge of madness") is stated clearly but feels somewhat generic and melodramatic. Character voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear symbolic arc (confronting fear via the net leads to 'triumph'), but the initiating action (finding a map at garage sales) feels contrived and disconnected from the core pyramid narrative. Pacing rushes the transformation; the cause-effect logic relies heavily on unexplained magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The pyramid library setting is evocative and works well with the character's phobias and the 'echoes' concept. However, the 'mundanely spiritual' attribute feels underdeveloped and doesn't strongly colour the atmosphere. Sensory details are present but not exceptionally vivid or unique.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (net=fears, mirrors=self-reflection) is overt and lacks subtlety. The story relies more on stating emotional shifts ("heart pounding not with fear," "phobias lighter") than showing them convincingly. The final line ("Like learning to fly") feels abrupt and unearned, disrupting the established tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable "confronting inner demons" template. Phrases like "shedding a layer of herself" and "dancing on the edge of madness" lean towards clich√©. The combination of elements feels somewhat arbitrary rather than organic, lacking a truly unique authorial stamp or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While managing to incorporate the elements, several (stunt double, garage sales, mundanely spiritual) feel poorly integrated or superficial, hindering overall cohesion. The story feels constructed *around* the elements rather than using them organically. Lacks the depth and polish for top-tier consideration.</comment>
