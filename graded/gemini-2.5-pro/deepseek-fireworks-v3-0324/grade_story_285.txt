<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's assigned traits (hesitant, awkward) are stated but not deeply woven into actions beyond initial stillness. The shift from uncertainty to readiness feels abrupt and insufficiently motivated by the crab observation alone. Motivation ("restore traditional systems") remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot arc (hesitation to resolve) exists but is minimal and driven more by internal shift than external action. The connection between the "final piece of evidence" and the tundra scene is tenuous. The hermit crab symbolism ("emerge") serves as the main catalyst, which is conceptually interesting but lacks strong narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting ("frigid tundra orchard dotted with geothermal vents") is vividly rendered and effectively creates an atmosphere of cold isolation contrasted with underlying life/warmth, supporting the story's themes. Sensory details are generally well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (crabs, postcard, vents) to explore themes of change and emergence. However, the emotional impact is muted by the somewhat abrupt character shift and the abstract nature of the conflict. The craft shows promise, but the subtext doesn't feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is somewhat unique, the prose occasionally dips into familiar phrasing ("weight of his task," "enormity of his mission"). The character's internal change relies on a fairly standard symbolic observation rather than nuanced psychological development. The emotional shift feels more stated ("felt ready") than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts to weave disparate elements together, with moderate success. The setting and the hermit crab metaphor work well, but the character's motivation and the "evidence" backstory feel less integrated. The vignette style suits the length, but the overall cohesion feels slightly strained by the required components.</comment>
