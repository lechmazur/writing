<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character feels more like an archetype fulfilling a function than a deeply realized individual; reliance on telling ("nervous," "rarely sincere") over showing nuanced behaviour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable escape trajectory; while coherent within the word limit, it lacks significant narrative tension or originality beyond the basic setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The unique setting potential ("bacteria-powered") is largely squandered, functioning as mere backdrop rather than deeply influencing plot or character; atmosphere relies on generic tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Technically competent but lacks significant emotional resonance or intellectual depth; the writing rarely rises above proficient execution of basic elements and standard imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on genre clich√©s (minstrel, mysterious photo, star navigation) and predictable narrative beats undermines originality; lacks a unique authorial voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The story fulfills the prompt's requirements adequately but fails to achieve genuine distinction or leave a lasting impact; feels competent but ultimately forgettable and unsuitable for top-tier publication.</comment>
