<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains largely archetypal; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced development beyond the central regret. The "joyful agony" feels stated rather than earned, bordering on melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, and the action 'appreciate' serves as a functional turning point. However, the progression feels somewhat predictable and reliant on symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are effectively rendered with evocative details (salt, decay, storm). The lighthouse as a symbolic space works well, but the "mirrored reflection" is poorly integrated as a 'timeframe'.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism is present (mirror, items, lighthouse) but heavy-handed, lacking subtlety. The theme of accepting regret is clear but delivered without significant depth or fresh insight. Emotional impact is present but muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on familiar tropes (burdened knight, symbolic journey/setting) without subversion. Language occasionally dips into clich√© or purple prose ("joyful agony"). Lacks a distinctive voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are technically integrated, but the result feels more like a competent thematic exercise than a vital, original story. Cohesive but lacks the spark required for top-tier publication.</comment>
