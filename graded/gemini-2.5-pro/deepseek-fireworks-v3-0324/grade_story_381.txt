<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The necromancer concept is intriguing, juxtaposed nicely with the cap, but the motivation ("map cave systems") feels underdeveloped for such a character. The "shared love for old movies" as the sole partnership reason strains credulity and feels like an artificial graft rather than organic character development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from exploration to discovery, using the fissure effectively as an inciting incident. However, the transition feels abrupt, and the story ends just as the core conflict begins, lacking a complete arc within the word count. The "dominate" action is stated but not fully demonstrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered with effective sensory details (drip, fungi glow, prismatic light). The juxtaposition of ancient formations and high-tech gear works well. The "futuristic nostalgia" tone is present but feels slightly underdeveloped and inconsistently woven through the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the "sound of resolve" as a recurring motif and symbol. Imagery is generally strong ("crystalline teeth"). However, the dialogue is merely functional, and the ending feels more like a chapter break than a satisfying conclusion for a short piece. Subtext regarding the necromancer's past is hinted at but remains vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the necromancer/spelunker pairing in a crystal cave offers some novelty, the underlying plot relies on the familiar trope of discovering a hidden danger deep underground. Phrases like "weight of centuries" lean clich√©. The reason for the partnership feels formulaic rather than authentic character interaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion, integrating most elements adequately, though some (like the movie connection) feel forced. The atmosphere is the strongest aspect. The brevity works reasonably well as a vignette, establishing mood and character, but it sacrifices plot resolution and deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
