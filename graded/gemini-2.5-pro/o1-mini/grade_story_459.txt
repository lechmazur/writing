<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (liberation) is clear but generic; the 'elevator tech' aspect is irrelevant, and 'elegantly clumsy' feels asserted rather than convincingly portrayed or integrated beyond a single plot device moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot arc exists but feels rushed and reliant on coincidence. The 'staking out ghost tours' method is poorly integrated, seemingly contradicted by the climax occurring at the lab during lunch. Cause/effect leading to the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting is intriguing and works adequately with the lunch break timeframe. However, the 'dissonance of silence' concept isn't atmospherically established; sensory details are sparse, weakening the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (crown) is present but heavy-handed. The story attempts emotional depth but the resolution feels unearned due to brevity and limited character/ghost interaction. Relies more on stating emotional shifts ('dissonance lift') than showing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The combination of elements has potential originality, but the execution leans on somewhat formulaic emotional beats and slightly overwrought phrasing ("dissect the dissonance of silence," "profound understanding of mutual loss"). Lacks nuanced emotion and fresh language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements; some feel forced (elevator tech, ghost tours method) rather than organic. The brevity hinders deep exploration, making the resolution feel superficial despite aiming for profundity.</comment>
