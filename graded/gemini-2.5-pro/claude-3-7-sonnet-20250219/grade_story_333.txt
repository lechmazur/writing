<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving tradition) is clear and consistent, but the portrayal of the 'sincere rebel' lacks depth and nuance beyond the label. Her internal conflict and fear feel stated rather than deeply inhabited, making her reactions somewhat generic for high literary standards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (setup, confrontation, discovery, escape) within the word limit, but relies on convenient tropes (ghost points the way). The 'theorize' action is present but doesn't strongly drive the core plot compared to finding the plans. Coherence is maintained, but the structure feels predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create adequate mood and urgency. However, the 'constantly changing' attribute is only superficially applied to shadows, lacking deeper integration. Sensory details are present but lean towards standard haunted passage descriptions rather than uniquely evocative imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story lacks significant emotional resonance or subtext. Literary devices are functional but not striking. The final message appearing on the note feels contrived and overly explicit, undermining potential thematic depth. Conflict is clear but resolved too neatly via supernatural aid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on familiar tropes (haunted school, benevolent ghost, dismissed mentor, evil administration) without offering fresh subversion. Character reasoning is straightforward, lacking human complexity. The magically appearing message and convenient ghost interaction feel formulaic and detract from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story integrates the assigned elements competently, but they feel somewhat assembled rather than organically woven. It lacks a distinctive voice or style, reading more like a functional response to constraints than a piece demanding publication based on unique artistic merit. The brief length feels adequate for the simple plot, but the overall impact is slight.</comment>
