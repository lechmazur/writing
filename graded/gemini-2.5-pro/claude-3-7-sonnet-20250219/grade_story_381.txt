<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and poignant, strongly tied to the object (cap) and memories (movies). However, the 'necromancer' aspect feels underdeveloped; his powers seem irrelevant to the core action and emotional drive, existing more as flavour text than a functional character trait within this specific narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is sound for a short piece, establishing the goal (mapping), the stakes (shifting cave, lost partner), and a moment of tension/resolve. The core action (mapping) drives the narrative effectively within the tight word count, achieving a sense of a snapshot within a larger ongoing effort. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered and integrated with the futuristic technology and nostalgic tone. Bioluminescence, echoes, and humming crystals create a strong, eerie atmosphere that enhances the character's isolation and the story's blend of sci-fi and poignant memory. Sensory details are effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes pathos through the juxtaposition of advanced technology and deep personal loss. Imagery (crystals, holograms, cap) is strong, and the theme of memory versus oblivion is palpable. The central conflict (man vs. environment/grief) is clear. It effectively 'shows' emotion through memory and action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of necromancy, sci-fi mapping, and retro-futuristic nostalgia offers a degree of originality. While the core grief narrative is familiar, the specific execution avoids major clich√©s. Language is generally purposeful, though phrases like "testament to his determination" lean slightly formal. Emotion feels mostly earned through context rather than explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, weaving the disparate elements (necromancy, baseball cap, quantum mapping, old movies, cave shifts) into a unified emotional and narrative whole. The elements largely serve the story's core theme of memory and loss. The brevity works, offering a poignant glimpse into the character's world and mission.</comment>
