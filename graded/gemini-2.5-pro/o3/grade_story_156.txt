<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character's 'confusion' feels more stated than demonstrated, and the shift from detachment ('Esc' key) to presence is somewhat abrupt given the story's brevity. Motivation evolves quickly from external assignment to internal realization, lacking deeper exploration of the initial state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc (arrival, observation, transformation) within the word limit, driven effectively by the 'liberalize via birds' action. However, the core mechanism (bird patterns as legislation) borders on whimsical, potentially straining credibility without further grounding, and the connection between choir, wisdom, and birds feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean salt mine setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details ("sulphur lights," "salt lanterns," "glittered like inverted cathedrals"), creating a unique atmosphere. The 'eerie' quality gives way effectively to wonder, supporting the narrative shift. The 'during bus rides' timeframe provides neat framing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story employs striking imagery and symbolism (key, mirrors, birds), prompting thought. However, the symbolism, particularly the 'Esc' key and the final bird formation ('doorway opening inward'), feels somewhat heavy-handed. The theme of alternative wisdom is clear but perhaps articulated too explicitly by the mayor, reducing subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and avoids common clich√©s but occasionally tips into overly ornate language ("avian punctuation," "scribbling algebra") that feels self-consciously literary rather than organically evocative. Phrases like "timidly bold" and the repetition of "joyfully tragic" feel slightly artificial or forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive, imaginative whole. The brevity feels intentional, creating a vignette-like experience. The core strength lies in the creative synthesis of concept, setting, and character arc, leaving a memorable impression despite stylistic concerns.</comment>
