<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The agoraphobia is central and effectively shapes the character's limitations and the plot's inward turn. Motivation is clear, but the internal shift resulting from rewriting the charter feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped for such a deep-seated condition within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (setup, inciting incident, climax, resolution) effectively driven by the 'crack' action and rain rhythm method. However, the climactic act of rewriting the charter feels somewhat summarized rather than fully depicted, slightly rushing the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent integration of setting (dunes, city hall, catacombs) and atmosphere. Sensory details (sand, rain, mildew, dust) are evocative and effectively ground the narrative, strongly supporting the character's internal state and the story's mystical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Demonstrates strong literary craft with effective imagery ("acoustic mirror," "shy applause") and symbolism (snuffbox, map, catacombs). The central conflict is clear, and a theme of internal change affecting external reality emerges. However, occasional metaphors border on overly stylized for truly seamless prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Largely avoids clich√©s and AI tells, employing mostly fresh language and specific details. The narrative voice is consistent. However, some phrasing ("realistically fanciful," "origami thunder") feels slightly self-consciously literary or conceptual rather than entirely organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The assigned elements are integrated cohesively, serving the narrative well. The story demonstrates creativity in combining the constraints, particularly the agoraphobia and the internal quest. The brief length feels purposeful, though the slightly rushed climax prevents it from achieving flawless execution.</comment>
