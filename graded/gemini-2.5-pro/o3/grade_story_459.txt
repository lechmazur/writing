<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a ghost-seeing technician is compelling and the first-person voice is distinct. However, the 'elegantly clumsy' attribute feels somewhat imposed, described rather than fully demonstrated or integrated into the core conflict/resolution beyond the initial mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, driven effectively by the 'dissect' action. The primary weakness is the 'staking out ghost tours' method; its connection to discovering this specific, non-touristy lab feels contrived and slightly weakens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting is highly original, evocative, and thematically resonant. Sensory details are specific and effectively build an atmosphere that strongly supports the concept ('dissonance of silence') and the character's internal state. The contrast with the mundane timeframe works well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional craft is evident in the use of imagery, symbolism (sand castles, flower crown), and the development of the liberation theme. The story successfully evokes emotion and achieves a resonant, satisfying ending through showing rather than telling. The central conflict is clear and well-resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates significant originality in its premise and execution, skillfully avoiding clich√©s and formulaic writing. The prose style is distinctive and fresh, metaphors are generally inventive ('tripping feathers', 'hourglass snow'), and emotional nuance is handled effectively. Feels authentic and unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story is highly cohesive and impactful, successfully integrating most elements into a resonant narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, showcasing concision and depth. Despite a minor logical flaw in the plot progression (the method), the creative combination of elements and strong execution make it memorable.</comment>
