<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gregor's insecurity is palpable and drives his actions, particularly his need for Dahlia's validation. However, the assigned attribute 'clearly ambiguous' feels somewhat awkwardly applied to his internal state ('mimicked Morse code yet spelled nothing decipherable') rather than emerging organically from his actions or deeper psychology. His motivation is clear, but the transition to his final decision feels slightly abrupt given the established insecurity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient for the word count, moving from setup (return to HQ) through rising action (search) to climax (discovery) and resolution (decision). The assigned action 'jab' is integrated plausibly, albeit retrospectively. The core concept 'dreamer's calling' feels underdeveloped and less integral compared to Gregor's core motivation. Pacing is well-managed, creating tension towards the reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The 'simmering future' timeframe and 'secret agent headquarters' setting mesh effectively to create a strong atmosphere of decayed grandeur and lingering secrets. Sensory details ('hush', 'echoed like a seashell', 'blue emergency bulbs', 'humming glass') are evocative. The 'fractured idyll' tone permeates the setting and Gregor's recollections, strongly supporting the narrative mood and character's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery ('glass tanks like planets', 'wires coiled like serpents') and symbolism (pigeons as 'scattered ciphers'). It successfully evokes a sense of unease and explores themes of dependence, power, and legacy. The central conflict is clear and the ending is purposeful, leaving lingering questions. Showing generally outweighs telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While using the 'brain in a jar' trope, the story imbues it with sufficient character focus to feel reasonably fresh. The language is often vivid, though phrases like 'simmering future' or 'scattered ciphers' border on being slightly overwrought. Character reasoning avoids simplistic logic, capturing human ambivalence. Generally avoids obvious AI tells, maintaining a consistent, albeit slightly melancholic, style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, integrating most elements effectively into a compelling narrative miniature. The assigned elements largely serve the story's atmosphere and Gregor's dilemma, rather than feeling like a checklist. The brevity feels deliberate, focusing tightly on Gregor's crucial moment of decision. It leaves the reader with a distinct mood and unresolved tension.</comment>
