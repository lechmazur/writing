<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Marlow's "overly curious" trait drives the plot, but the mortician aspect feels like flavour rather than deeply integrated motivation. His actions align, but the character lacks a truly distinct voice or profound internal depth beyond the stated curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear, albeit simple, arc within the word limit. The core action (imitate) and method (footprints) are central, but the resolution feels slightly convenient. Pacing is adequate, but lacks exceptional tension or narrative complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth setting and dawn timeframe create a strong, unique atmosphere, effectively enhanced by sensory details (jasmine, ozone, salt). The tone of "polite anarchy" is well-realized, though some descriptions border on overly lush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story uses evocative imagery (living morgue drawer, moonlight/kelp journals) and explores interesting themes (memory, death, respect). However, the emotional impact feels somewhat muted, and the subtext could be more resonant for top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept is original, avoiding major clich√©s. However, the density of specific, slightly unusual assigned phrases ("polite anarchy," "loudly serene," "rustle of revelation") feels somewhat artificial and constraint-driven, slightly hindering a fully organic narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves good cohesion, integrating most elements effectively. The brevity works, and the combination of elements shows creativity. However, the slight forcing of certain phrases slightly detracts from seamlessness, preventing it from feeling entirely effortless.</comment>
