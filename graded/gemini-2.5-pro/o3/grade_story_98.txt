<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Halden's 'fainthearted' trait is established but resolves too abruptly with the final revelation, making the character arc feel slightly unearned. Motivation is clear, but the dog's role feels more like a plot device than a deep character interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, effectively driven by the tapestry method. However, the final resolution feels somewhat rushed, slightly diminishing the impact of the preceding build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong, effectively using the setting (chamber, fog) and sensory details (wax, muffled echoes) to support the tone and concept. The 'dog walking' timeframe provides contrast but feels slightly less integrated than the core setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (ruler, tapestry, mirrored script) and explores a clear theme about security and narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional shift feels slightly sudden. Craft is generally strong, showing promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While containing original elements like the ruler and mirrored script, some phrasing ("wax dripped like stalled minutes," "woven night") borders on overly ornate. The core concept avoids clich√©, but the execution isn't entirely free of slightly mannered prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion, integrating most elements effectively, particularly the ruler and tapestry. The brief length feels appropriate for the vignette style, leaving a lingering thematic thought, though some elements feel more 'placed' than organic.</comment>
