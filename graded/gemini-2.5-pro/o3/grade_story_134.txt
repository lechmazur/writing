<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'obnoxiously polite' attribute feels superficially applied, particularly during the apology sequence, rather than deeply integrated into the character's core or consistently influencing actions beyond that moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot coherence suffers slightly from the arbitrary connection between oak whispers and salt memories; the mechanism lacks sufficient internal logic, even for a fantasy setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>High conceptual originality is present, but execution includes potentially formulaic adherence to the 'polite' trait and language that sometimes borders on purple prose, slightly undermining its freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements reasonably well, but the aforementioned weaknesses in character trait integration and logical connection prevent it from feeling truly seamless or achieving flawless cohesion.</comment>
