<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The 'tense bodyguard' attribute is asserted initially but isn't consistently demonstrated through action or internal monologue beyond the opening; motivation is clear but character voice feels slightly overwritten rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit; the method (listening) logically enables the escape, though the appearance of Mara feels somewhat convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly realized and effectively contrasts with the desired Earthly freedom, enhancing the atmosphere and character motivation; sensory details are generally well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (photograph, seeds, tunnel) elevate the narrative, but some phrasing ("serenity cloaks that hum in slow anger") borders on overly stylized, slightly diminishing the overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells, the story leans on familiar tropes (escape from oppressive control) and some language feels constructed ("serendipitously stubborn," the repeated "serene anger") rather than organically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story integrates the required elements reasonably well, achieving cohesion, but occasionally feels constrained by them; the style is ambitious but sometimes sacrifices clarity for effect.</comment>
