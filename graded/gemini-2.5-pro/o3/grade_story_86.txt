<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'usually exceptional' attribute feels asserted rather than demonstrated, undermined by the focus on apprehension without deeper exploration of this contrast. Motivation is clear but the character's internal state lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is present, but the resolution hinges on the drones' abrupt, convenient change of behavior, weakening coherence. The backstory delivery via hot air balloon feels forced and tonally inconsistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere blending cyberpunk sterility with organic/legacy elements (candle, bones). Sensory details are present, though the 'ancient timeline' aspect feels more like flavour text than a deeply integrated world element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, arrow, cycles) and some striking imagery (mandalas). However, the theme of compassion is stated too explicitly, lacking subtlety expected at this level. The drone resolution feels unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Some originality in the candle-key concept and archer protagonist, but marred by occasional purple prose ("bled saffron light") and reliance on a convenient trope subversion (compassionate AI) without sufficient groundwork. Feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Integrates most elements adequately, but the story strains under the weight of some forced inclusions (hot air balloon) and plot conveniences (drones), preventing it from feeling truly seamless or achieving flawless execution.</comment>
