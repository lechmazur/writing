<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aristea's motivation is clear, but her character feels more symbolic than deeply explored; her internal landscape beyond 'regret' and 'duty' remains underdeveloped within the constraints. Orric is functional but static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc (setup, action, resolution) effectively within the word count, but the Lighthouse Council interaction feels abrupt and underdeveloped, slightly straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atom-punk lighthouse setting is vividly realized and atmospheric, strongly supporting the tone and themes. The timeframe "line that never moves" is evocative but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of evocative imagery and symbolism (tablecloth, lighthouse, blood). The craft is strong, though some poetic phrasing ("bruised gold," "catapult your promise") borders on excessive richness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept blends genres uniquely, avoiding obvious clich√©s. However, the sheer density of high-concept elements risks feeling slightly contrived or formulaic in its assembly under harsh scrutiny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated serviceably, creating a cohesive, poignant snapshot. The density of unique concepts packed into the short form is ambitious, mostly successful, but pushes the limits of seamless integration.</comment>
