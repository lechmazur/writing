<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character arc feels compressed; the foundational "righteously flawed arrogance" isn't sufficiently demonstrated before the rapid shift near the end. Voice is distinct, but internal change lacks convincing development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on convenient discoveries (tile surfacing, organ activating glyphs); pacing is efficient for the word count but risks feeling slightly rushed, glossing over potential nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere and sensory detail, but the "lonely church organ" feels slightly dissonant within the Roman bath setting without further context. The 'throughout concerts' timeframe integration is weak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High level of craft with effective imagery and thematic clarity (knowledge vs. fear, resonance vs. extraction). However, it lacks groundbreaking depth or a truly unforgettable emotional punch for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original combination of elements avoids obvious AI tells, but the prose occasionally borders on overwrought ("spectral ribbons," "resonant subcurrents"). Relies on familiar genre elements (ancient secrets, alien intervention) despite fresh synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally cohesive and creative integration of disparate elements. Weakened slightly by the underdeveloped timeframe element and plot mechanics that lean towards convenient resolution rather than earned discovery.</comment>
