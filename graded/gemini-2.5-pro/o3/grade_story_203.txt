<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stage fright is established as central, but its resolution triggered by the key sound feels somewhat convenient and externally imposed, rather than a fully earned internal shift. Motivation is clear, but the character's internal processing of the trigger feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the 'exorcism'. However, the core transformation (orbital debris greening instantly) relies on a fantastical leap that feels abrupt, needing more grounding or foreshadowing even within a speculative context. Pacing is effective but rushes the climax slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of orbital debris and organic life (flowers, greening) creates a potent atmosphere. The setting is vividly realized and integral to the theme and action. Sensory details like the metallic click and luminous pollen are effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (flowers, debris, exorcism). The story evokes hope and defiance effectively. The theme of truth vs. lies is well-integrated. However, some phrasing ("amen of chlorophyll," "metal remembers it was once a root") borders on being overly poetic or self-conscious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept and blend of sci-fi with organic/mystical elements feel original. Language is generally fresh, avoiding obvious clich√©s. However, the reliance on a somewhat external trigger and a near-magical resolution slightly lessens the feeling of deep authenticity in the character's journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most elements into a cohesive and evocative whole. The style generally supports the narrative, and the brevity feels purposeful. The combination of elements shows creativity, leaving a lingering sense of fragile hope. Minor weaknesses in plot mechanics prevent a higher score.</comment>
