<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation is clear and her final action aligns, but her defining "uncertainty" feels more stated than deeply woven into her actions until the climax. Argos, while functional, borders on being a convenient oracle rather than a fully fleshed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is remarkably tight and coherent for the word count, achieving a clear arc. The central action drives the narrative effectively, though the "reading scuffs" method requires significant suspension of disbelief, feeling slightly contrived as the sole verification method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating marketplace setting is highly original and atmospheric, synergizing well with the "mundane miracles" tone and the precariousness of Garnet's quest. Sensory details are evocative, strongly enhancing the mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (scale, tilting floor) and evocative imagery. The story successfully explores its theme, prompting reflection. The ending is purposeful, though the marketplace's reaction ("steadied as if honoring her choice") feels slightly too on-the-nose symbolically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept and setting feel fresh, avoiding major clich√©s. Language is mostly strong, though a few phrases ("syntax of wear") lean towards being slightly ornate. The core emotional arc feels earned, though Argos's wisdom delivery is a familiar narrative pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, integrating disparate elements into a meaningful narrative. The brevity feels intentional, focusing the impact. It successfully uses its unique components to serve a resonant theme, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
