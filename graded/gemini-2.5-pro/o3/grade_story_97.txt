<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the initial action, but the "desperately casual" attribute feels asserted rather than consistently demonstrated through nuanced action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent, albeit rapid, arc from entry to transformation; the assigned action and method are integrated effectively, though the final steadying feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The unstable dimension setting is vividly rendered with strong imagery ("broken equations," "mirrored meadow") that effectively enhances the atmosphere and character's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses evocative literary devices and explores a clear theme (logic vs. empathy), but the language occasionally borders on overwrought, slightly diminishing the overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While featuring some fresh metaphors ("arithmetic sorrow"), the core conflict is familiar, and certain phrases ("optimistic desperation," "luminous remorse") feel slightly self-consciously ornate rather than truly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves reasonable cohesion with its assigned elements and demonstrates creative ambition, but minor stylistic excesses and a somewhat predictable thematic arc prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
