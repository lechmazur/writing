<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation is established as both professional (“methodically curious”) and deeply personal (“visceral,” linked to her grandmother), creating a compelling and consistent interiority. Her final emotional catharsis (“wept, not from sorrow, but from recognition”) is earned by the meticulous intellectual journey preceding it, perfectly satisfying the 9+ test for an earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate, and the narrative builds density through layered observations toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure, where the torn map shifts from a "wound" to an "invitation." The final image of the shadow-chapel provides a resonant "after" state with a clear felt cost, fully satisfying the requirements for publishable work under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with the setting acting as a direct constraint on the climax. The henge is not a backdrop but a participant, its stones forming the "enduring grammar" that makes the discovery possible. The specific detail of the setting—from the "weeping" condensation to the angle of the last light—is integral to the plot's mechanics and the final, charged image of the silhouette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conflict is subtle, internal, and powerful. The stake—to witness a presence that defies conventional proof—is established early and pursued with clear agency. The key deepening occurs when the shadow's path is revealed as a deliberate "choreography," transforming the investigation from speculation to confirmation. This escalation, driven by the protagonist's method, leads directly to the resolution with a palpable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging with profound resonance from the central conceit. The idea of silence as a "vessel" rather than a "void" is explored through concrete action and imagery, not didacticism. The final image of the "whispered chapel" offers a non-literal, deeply moving answer to the story’s questions about memory, loss, and how we bear witness to the erased.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and impeccably controlled, establishing a distinct perceptual signature from the first line. The close third-person POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, blending methodical observation with rich interiority. The elevated, almost incantatory rhythm of the prose perfectly matches the protagonist’s reverent, scholarly pursuit without a single lapse in register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, yet remains clear and purposeful. While walking the line of overwriting, it succeeds by ensuring each metaphor (the "cartographic wound," the "grammar" of the stones) serves the central theme and advances understanding. The sentences are elegantly constructed with varied rhythms, propelling the quiet narrative forward with grace and precision; there are no loops or wasted words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original. The central premise—using comparative analysis of shadows in archival footage to rediscover a non-physical structure—is ingenious and fresh. It transforms the familiar trope of the archaeologist/historian into something deeply poetic and modern, synthesizing technology, myth, and personal memory into a seamless, unforgettable vision.</comment>
