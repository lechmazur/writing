<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is both unique and deeply felt, established immediately and driving every action. Interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic specifics ("a sliver of suspended time that clung like pollen to the inside of her ribs"), avoiding cliché. The final acceptance of her role is an earned endurance that provides a powerful sense of closure without needing a dramatic change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure is a simple, elegant ritual arc that builds atmospheric pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands beautifully on the page, with the conceptual cost felt in the final image of the cottage unclinching its "ghostly fingers" and the protagonist's quiet continuation of her endless task. All orientation and structural elements are seamless for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric specificity, functioning as an active participant in the story. Details like "reeds whispered secrets to the tide" and "silence pooled like spilled ink" establish a potent mood. The bay itself is a crucial element of the ritual, providing the threshold and the means of the shard's dissolution, directly constraining choice and charging the final, resonant images.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict is subtle, internal, and conceptual—pitting the protagonist’s intentional remembrance against the "creeping normality"—and is perfectly suited to the story's aims. The stake (the spiritual peace of a forgotten place) is clear. Pressure deepens effectively during the ritual sequence ("The hush deepened"), leading to a resolution where the cost is the release of a precious object and the acceptance of a perpetual, solitary mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory and reverence for the forgotten emerges organically and powerfully from the central action. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, particularly the line, "Some houses feel alive because they are loved beyond their walls, beyond their time." This explicit statement slightly lessens the resonance that was already masterfully built through image and subtext, constituting a minor thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is the story's greatest strength: singular, poetic, and flawlessly maintained. The third-person limited POV has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a unique lens ("streetlights daydreamed," "windows blinked like half-asleep eyes"). Psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into the protagonist's quiet, intense inner world with confidence and grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful. The only minor weakness is a slight turn toward template cadence in the final two paragraphs (e.g., "not to preserve, but to honor. Not to stop the creep, but to walk beside it..."), which introduces a hint of scaffold-like structure into an otherwise fluid piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a "creeping normality noticer" who sanctifies forgotten places with displaced resonant objects is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The story transforms familiar themes of memory and loss into something fresh and specific. Its quiet, confident vision feels authentic and memorable, avoiding cliché and offering a genuinely new perspective.</comment>
