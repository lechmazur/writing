<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—to resolve her own guilt by healing the machine's—is clear and compelling. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through her craft, and her actions, particularly the final ritual, are a direct and earned consequence of her established skills and past failures. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice of healing over destruction that feels both inevitable and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. It builds pressure through a series of discoveries and symbolic acts that cohere perfectly. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where both the protagonist and the machine are transformed, not just fixed. The final cost—her blood, her confronted grief—is legible and proportionate, landing with significant emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" is a masterclass in world-building through specific, evocative detail. The atmosphere is established immediately and maintained with exceptional control. Crucially, the setting is not decorative; key objects like the cradle, the amber, and the Model L-7 machine directly constrain action and charge the final, transformative image. This is setting as an active, indispensable force in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stakes are deeply personal and metaphysical, signaled early and escalated with precision. The conflict deepens from an atmospheric haunting to a direct confrontation with specific, personal guilt (the grieving father). The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, using her unique skills to face the conflict. The cost is clear and the transformation earned, fulfilling all requirements for a high-impact narrative arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, memory, and redemption are woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric through image and action. The final image of the "Cradle Major" constellation is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The piece just misses a higher score due to a few lines that verge on stating the theme directly, such as "silence wasn’t peace—it was suffocation," which slightly lessens the power of the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with virtuosic control, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the story's tone. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through the tattooist's specific worldview. Psychic distance shifts appropriately with emotional intensity, drawing the reader in without ever breaking character or control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense, musical, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is inventive and consistent with the story's internal logic ("broken gramophones spun static into symphonies"). The piece avoids prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, maintaining momentum and clarity despite its stylistic richness. Every sentence serves a purpose, building a cohesive and immersive whole.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is built on a foundation of remarkable originality, synthesizing elements of fantasy, gothic tech, and emotional realism into something entirely new. The core concept of a constellation tattooist who mends souls is fresh, and its execution is specific and confident. The resolution—redeeming haunted technology rather than destroying it—is an ingenious and emotionally resonant turn that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
