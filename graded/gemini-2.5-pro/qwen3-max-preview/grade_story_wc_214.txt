<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a well-defined backstory that justifies his present actions. His interiority is specific and his philosophy of empathic observation is demonstrated, not just stated. The final choice—to return to sweeping—is a powerful act of renunciation that perfectly captures the character's earned peace, satisfying the criteria for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The narrative deepens from a baseline state to a moment of profound confirmation (the comet's "efflorescence"), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the janitor's worldview is validated. The closure lands on the page with a clear felt cost—tears of recognition reaffirming his solitary path—making the final image of him sweeping both quiet and potent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric specificity and function. The forgotten station is not just a backdrop but the necessary crucible for the character's philosophy. The yellow lantern glass acts as a perfect micro-setting, a tool that constrains perception and charges both the climactic scene and the final image. Every detail, from "analog dials" to "star-dust," serves the story's central theme and deepens the sense of reverent isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's central conflict is internal and handled with nuance and depth. The dominant stake—the janitor’s spiritual peace—is tested and deepened by the arrival of the rogue comet. This event serves as the single, meaningful intensification required for an Accumulative design, forcing a crystallization of his stance. The resolution is earned through his agency of attention and empathy, and the cost of his philosophy (isolation, being "mad") is made palpable in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty and strength in collapse ("flourishing stillness") is woven deeply into the story's fabric through imagery and action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary, such as, "His motivation had never been glory or discovery; it was simply to find strength in vulnerability." This direct statement slightly weakens the subtext, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is the story's crowning achievement—lyrical, meditative, and entirely consistent. The close third-person POV maintains a perfect psychic distance, allowing for deep interiority without ever feeling unmoored. The perceptual signature is distinct; the world is filtered through the janitor's unique lens of empathy for impermanence. The prose rhythm matches the deep-space breathing mentioned in the opening, demonstrating superb control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished, poetic, and demonstrates high information density without feeling cluttered. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, as in "vulnerability wearing its most radiant armor." The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, and its sentence structures vary to create a compelling, hypnotic rhythm that supports the meditative tone. The line-level craft is exceptional and serves the story's aims at every turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "cosmic janitor" who practices empathy with dying stars is highly original, transforming a sci-fi trope into a profound spiritual meditation. The story avoids cliché by grounding its abstract philosophy in concrete actions and a specific, memorable character. The synthesis of astronomical phenomena with themes of vulnerability and acceptance feels both fresh and, in hindsight, inevitable. It's a thoughtful and unique piece of fiction.</comment>
