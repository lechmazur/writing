<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character attributes (overqualified, dreamy) are stated rather than deeply demonstrated through action or voice; motivation ("restore lost faith") feels generic and lacks specific personal grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a predictable arc (stagnation -> intervention -> renewal) resolved too neatly within the word count; the overcoming of skepticism and the fireflies' reaction feel convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is adequately established but relies on standard descriptions; the specified tone ("bruised exhilaration") is explicitly mentioned but not effectively evoked through narrative detail or character experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes and emotional states; symbolism (chalkboard, fireflies) is present but lacks subtlety, and the overall impact is pleasant but superficial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Significant reliance on clich√©s ("lost its luster," "passion was contagious," small-town stagnation trope) and generic phrasing undermines originality; lacks a distinctive voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the elements are technically incorporated, the story feels constructed around them rather than organically emerging; it achieves coherence but lacks the depth, nuance, and artistic spark required for top-tier publication.</comment>
