<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core contradiction (exorcist with stage fright) is stated but not deeply explored or convincingly demonstrated within the text; motivation is clear but feels somewhat generic ("confront the lies of her past") without unique nuance tied specifically to *this* character's blend of traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is present (stasis, trigger, resolution) but relies on a slightly contrived trigger (recorded key sound). The metaphorical use of "submerge" works, but the overall progression feels predictable rather than revelatory within the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and effectively contrasts with the character's internal state and the wildflowers, creating a strong atmosphere of isolation and quiet defiance. Sensory details are present and contribute well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (toys, key, wildflowers) is employed effectively, and a central conflict/theme is clear. However, the writing sometimes tells rather than shows (e.g., the impact of the lies, the nature of the stage fright) and leans on slightly overwrought phrasing ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the core concept has originality (space exorcist, toy making), the execution relies on familiar tropes (shattering childhood discovery, confronting past trauma). Some phrasing feels slightly generic, lacking a truly distinctive authorial voice or unexpected narrative turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but their synthesis doesn't feel entirely seamless or inevitable; the connection between exorcism, stage fright, and toy-making in space feels conceptually interesting but not fully realized organically. It functions as a vignette but lacks profound depth.</comment>
