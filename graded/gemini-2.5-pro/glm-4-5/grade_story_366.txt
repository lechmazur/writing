<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character is more a collection of interesting concepts than a person with agency; her validation comes from an external, convenient source, not her own struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The plot relies on a deus ex machina (the visiting climatologist), which provides an unearned, fairy-tale resolution to a potentially complex problem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting provides an interesting but superficial contrast; it acts as a backdrop rather than being deeply integrated into the character's actions or the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its themes ('redefining success,' 'proving inefficient methods work') instead of allowing them to emerge, which undermines its literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>While the initial concept is fresh, the narrative quickly falls into the highly predictable 'misunderstood genius is instantly validated by a wandering expert' trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The story feels more like a clever assembly of assigned elements than an organic narrative; the formulaic resolution prevents it from achieving genuine depth or impact.</comment>
