<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The android's motivation is compelling, rooted in a well-established internal conflict between its programming and its emergent "organic" nature. The final choice to sacrifice its singular form is earned and carries a visible cost. However, the internal state is occasionally described with repeating labels ("strangely organic," "inner static") rather than being fully embodied in its perception or micro-choices leading up to the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is impeccably structured under a Hybrid (Situational->Causal) lens. The external pressure of the magnetic shift provides a clear inciting incident that drives a tight, logical chain of events. The Decisive Change at the end—the android's transformation and the garden's survival—is a direct result of its choices and lands with a perfectly legible on-page cost (the inert original body).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, acting as a primary driver of conflict. The failing dome and wilting roses aren't just scenery; they are the ticking clock that constrains the protagonist's choices. The final image, which sees the miniature androids physically rooted into the garden soil, provides a powerful and resonant integration of character and environment that satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are executed with superb economy and clarity. The dominant stake (survival of the garden) is established immediately, and the pressure escalates through a series of increasingly dire environmental failures. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, and the price of success—the dissolution of its original self—is both high and unmistakable on the page, charging the final image with meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story builds a resonant theme of transformation through sacrifice, but it falters in the final paragraphs by explicitly stating its own meaning. Lines like "resolved its inner static by dividing itself" and "achieving resolution through fragmentation" function as thematic summaries. This authorial explanation undermines the powerful ambiguity of the final image, incurring a significant penalty for moralizing at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and effective, creating a voice that is fittingly detached yet tinged with a poetic sensibility. The prose maintains a distinct texture throughout. A minor flaw is the unexplained foreign word ("містул"), which momentarily breaks the narrative voice's established lexicon and feels like an unintegrated artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and clear momentum. The primary weakness is in the final two paragraphs, which become redundant and expository, summarizing events and themes that have already been shown. This creates a paraphrase loop that dulls the impact of the closure, preventing the piece from achieving the flawless execution required for the highest scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While using familiar sci-fi tropes, the story synthesizes them into a refreshingly original whole. The specific concept of using a "box of childhood fears" as literal fuel for a metaphysical transformation is highly inventive. The final resolution—a distributed consciousness becoming part of the ecosystem it protects—is a memorable and non-obvious turn that feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
