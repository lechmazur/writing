<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The character is more of a twee archetype than a person; the key attribute "usually unusual" is told directly to the reader rather than demonstrated through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The "flash mob" is a deeply implausible and tonally jarring plot device that fractures the narrative's coherence and feels entirely contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create a potent, contemplative atmosphere, but this strength is severely undermined by the illogical plot event that shatters it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>An original core concept is executed with tired tropes (the clumsy meet-cute, the wise eccentric) and feels formulaic, especially in its neat, summarized ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The story feels reverse-engineered to accommodate its assigned elements, resulting in a critical failure of plot logic that prevents the narrative from achieving genuine cohesion.</comment>
