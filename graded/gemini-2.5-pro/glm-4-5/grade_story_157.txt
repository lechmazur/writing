<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The strong, evocative atmosphere of the lighthouse library is shattered by the jarring and tonally dissonant inclusion of "tailgating," a flaw from which the world-building cannot recover.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on telling over showing, explicitly stating its themes ("awakening a dormant connection") and motivations, which strips the story of potential subtext and nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The story feels like a mechanical exercise in fulfilling a checklist of prompts rather than an organic narrative, with disparate elements clashing rather than cohering into a publishable whole.</comment>
