<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is clear and consistent, effectively bookending the narrative. However, her interiority lacks texture; the critical choice to "weave truth carefully" is presented as a solved problem rather than a dramatized internal conflict with palpable risk. The character reads as a highly competent functionary for the plot, but her personal struggle or any contradictory impulses remain unexplored, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective two-shard structure with a strong Causal drive. The plot progresses logically from discovery to investigation to resolution without any breaks in causality. Closure is achieved on the page through a Decisive Change (the spirit's release) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the globe clearing), with the cost felt by the descendants, making the ending earned and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The settings of the underwater wreck and the glacier shrine are rendered with evocative, purposeful detail that establishes a potent atmosphere. The "melted snow globe" functions as a perfect micro-setting, a recurring object whose physical state directly constrains the plot and charges the final image. Its transformation from warped and warm to glowing and clear provides a powerful visual anchor for the story's resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving justice to salvage purity—is signaled early and escalates effectively from a physical quest to a moral challenge. The key tightening occurs when Elara discovers the truth and must decide *how* to reveal it, a choice driven by her agency that directly shapes the outcome. The resolution is earned through her actions, and the cost, while handled gently, is legible in the descendants' need to absorb a difficult truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging purity from lies is potent and well-integrated into the plot, culminating in the resonant final image of the cleared snow globe. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly ("to salvage something pure," "salvage what was pure"). The final two paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with overt moralizing, incurring a penalty for thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, establishing a distinct lyrical and ethereal tone. Elara's perceptual signature as a "ghost whisperer" feels coherent, filtering the world through a supernatural lens. The prose is controlled and confident, though it doesn't take significant risks in form or style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on a few key figurative phrases ("borrowed starlight") to the point of repetition. The final paragraphs become too abstract, summarizing action and theme rather than grounding the conclusion in a final, concrete moment ("healed a rupture between worlds... weaving truth carefully until it became something beautiful"). This prose artifact slightly dulls the otherwise sharp impact of the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wreck-diver with a ghost whisperer is an inventive and memorable starting point. While the "ghost seeks justice" plot is a known trope, the story transforms it through its unique mechanics (dream cameos) and its thematic focus on gentle, restorative truth-telling instead of vengeance. The specific details create a fresh and authentic vision that feels distinct.</comment>
