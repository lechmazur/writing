<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'streetwise' attribute is told, not shown, rendering the character a generic archetype driven by the plot device rather than a distinct personality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While technically cohesive, the story reads like a mechanical exercise in prompt-filling, where the required elements dictate a predictable plot rather than serving an original vision.</comment>
