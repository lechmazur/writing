<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character feels like a collection of assigned traits; the "performer" identity is asserted but not meaningfully explored, leaving her feeling more like a symbol than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story achieves a complete emotional arc, the coherence is undermined by overt repetition of key terms, making the structure feel formulaic and transparent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels highly formulaic, marked by excessive repetition of key phrases and adherence to a predictable emotional trope, lacking a unique authorial voice or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story feels reverse-engineered from its assigned elements; their constant, verbatim repetition makes the author's scaffolding visible and prevents the narrative from feeling organic or inspired.</comment>
