<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is compelling and drives the narrative effectively. His internal conflict, born from his profession, is palpable and the final emotional release feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally veers into diagnostic language, particularly in the final beats (e.g., "understood what he had been quelling all these years—the knowledge that..."), which slightly summarizes the emotional state rather than fully embodying it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through reflection and ritual until a pattern-break discovery. The two-shard structure (terrace to shore) is clean and purposeful. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the grandfather's carving redefines Martin's entire history of guilt, landing with the visible cost of "tears he hadn't allowed himself to shed for years." Causality is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and evocative, with the "cobalt terrace at dusk" and "forgotten shore" perfectly matching the character's internal state. The story excels by using objects as a micro-setting; the driftwood carvings are not just backdrop but the very medium of the conflict and climax. The discovery of the grandfather's specific carving among the others constrains the character's delusions and forces the final, resonant choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central stake—Martin's need for reconciliation with his past—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. Pressure deepens effectively through his nightly, obsessive search. The key turn, finding the unexpected carving, is a direct result of his sustained agency and forces a confrontation that pays a clear emotional price: the weight of decades of unnecessary guilt. This is a well-executed escalation for a story of this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of authentic versus manufactured history is brilliantly woven into the character's profession and personal crisis, culminating in the resonant image of the two watch hands reconciled. The story avoids easy moralizing for most of its length. However, the final sentence ("sometimes the most valuable inheritance is... what we finally choose to acknowledge") is an explicit thematic statement that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene by articulating the moral the reader has just inferred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is maintained with skill and confidence, and the psychic distance shifts smoothly between external action and internal reflection. The narrative voice has a distinct, melancholic texture that is consistent and controlled under pressure. The character's perceptual signature is strong; he views the world, particularly the carvings, with the practiced eye of his trade, which makes the final discovery more impactful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and precise for the most part, with strong imagery ("sieved hush," "cobalt terrace"). However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts, including the repetition of key phrases like "sieved hush" and "tempered regret," and a conceptual loop around the word "weight." While the writing is high-quality, these redundancies create a slight echo that keeps the line-level craft just shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of a "guilt-ridden black market genealogist" is fresh and compelling, offering a unique angle on the familiar theme of confronting one's past. The story avoids cliché by focusing on a quiet, internal resolution rather than a more predictable thriller plot. The integration of the unique profession with the specific, tangible method of resolution (the driftwood carvings) feels both original and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
