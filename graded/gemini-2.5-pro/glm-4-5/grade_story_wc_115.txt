<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation is clear, but the core internal conflict between his "religiously skeptical nature" and his actions is asserted rather than dramatized. The skepticism dissolves too easily in the face of the psychic phenomena, making his final acceptance feel less earned. The character arc is present but lacks the friction of a genuine, on-page struggle with his established worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a clear closure. The radio call serves as a well-timed catalyst, leading to a Conceptual Repricing where the "ghost shift" is re-contextualized. The ending provides a resonant shift in understanding with a felt personal cost, fulfilling the requirements for this story length and mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and functional, but the beaded valve wheel elevates this category significantly. Functioning as a micro-setting, the object is not merely described but actively constrains Marcus's attention, acts as a conduit for the story's climax, and directly charges the final thematic image. Its tangible presence grounds the supernatural elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central stake—finding the "swallowed truth"—is established early and pursued consistently. The radio confession provides a single, effective tightening of pressure that leads directly to the climax. The protagonist's agency lies in his choice to surrender to the experience, and the resolution has a legible, internal cost: the acknowledgment of his own unspoken truths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken truths is developed organically for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statements, particularly the psychic's line and the narrator's summary of what Marcus has learned. This over-articulation ("Thematic Echo") slightly undermines the resonance by explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting the final image do the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice effectively captures the blend of a practical explorer with a hidden sensitivity to the uncanny. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during the visionary climax without losing narrative clarity. The voice is distinct and serves the story's aims well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean and propulsive for the most part. However, the final two paragraphs contain some summary and scaffolding that could have been rendered through image ("he realized he'd found what he came for... an understanding that..."). This tendency to summarize the emotional and thematic takeaway in the final beats slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise strong ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept, which synthesizes urban exploration with supernatural investigation via talk radio, is highly original and engaging. While the story employs some familiar ghost-story elements (a haunted object, a tragic secret), the specific method Marcus uses to "appraise" the phenomena provides a fresh and memorable angle on the genre.</comment>
