<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's core motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the assigned attribute "elegantly clumsy" feels more like a twee assertion than a demonstrated trait, and his profession is mere set-dressing to grant access to the setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story has a remarkably complete and coherent arc for its length, but it is marred by the inclusion of the "ghost tours" method, which is delivered as a single, awkward line of exposition rather than being integrated into the plot's momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The sand castle preservation lab is a brilliant, original setting that is thematically resonant, creating a powerful atmosphere that perfectly supports the narrative's core concepts of impermanence and preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (crown, sand castles) to build its theme, but it undermines its own craft by repeatedly and explicitly stating its message, distrusting the reader to grasp the subtext. This heavy-handedness lessens the potential for a truly profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise subverts the standard ghost trope in a thoughtful way, the narrative's emotional journey feels overly neat and logically structured. Phrases like "complex simplicity" and the tendency to state themes directly lend it a slightly formulaic quality, lacking a distinctive, idiosyncratic authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and intelligent story where the core elements (setting, object, theme) work in near-perfect harmony. However, it is held back from excellence by a lack of subtlety and the clumsy integration of one or two minor elements, making it feel skillfully engineered rather than organically inspired.</comment>
