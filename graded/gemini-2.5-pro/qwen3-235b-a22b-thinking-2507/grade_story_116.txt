<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character serves as a thin archetype for the story's theme; his assigned attribute 'subjectively rational' is stated explicitly rather than revealed organically through action or thought, making his motivation feel more like an instruction than a genuine trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A strong, self-contained internal arc is achieved within the word count. The plot is coherent and driven effectively by the central action, but it remains entirely static and intellectual, lacking any tangible stakes or external tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The evocative atmosphere of the sky-lounge is a strength, but it is critically undermined by the jarring and almost completely unintegrated 'amid garden secrets' element, which appears once and breaks narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambitious imagery is marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., the double use of 'bled') and a tendency toward overwrought, self-conscious lyricism that repeatedly explains its own symbolism instead of trusting the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative feels reverse-engineered from its constituent prompts. The mechanical repetition of keywords ('subjectively rational,' 'excavate,' 'drawn boundaries') gives it an artificial, formulaic quality that stifles any sense of authentic authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While built on a compelling central metaphor, the story fails to seamlessly integrate all its core elements and suffers from strained, repetitive prose. It reads as a clever exercise rather than a fully realized, publishable work of fiction.</comment>
