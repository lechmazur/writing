<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, fitting the story's length and focus. The characterization is competent, but lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses needed for the highest tier; her function as a dispassionate archivist is consistent but limits deep emotional engagement. Her 'change' is a logical deepening of her mission rather than a difficult, costly choice, which feels appropriate for her non-human nature but less dramatically compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses logically from one discovery to the next, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of Elara’s mission. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—a solitary, unending task—encapsulated in the final paragraph, making the before/after state of her purpose perfectly legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the "reclaimed silo library" and the hearth room providing a tangible, resonant space. Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, masterfully established by the concept of "bronze quiet." The key objects—the diaries and the tapestry—are not just props but active elements that constrain Elara's investigation and charge the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against absolute silence—is established immediately and holds firm. The conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens by deepening, rather than reversing; the realization that the tapestry holds planetary trauma raises the stakes from human history to geological history. The cost is made clear in Elara's final, crystallized commitment to her unending task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory and its various forms of record—textual, artistic, geological—is woven together with subtlety and intelligence. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of synthesis as its answer to the central question of what endures. The line "perhaps all stories were warnings" provides a lingering, complex thematic echo that elevates the piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly suited to a non-human historian—precise, formal, and slightly detached. The point of view remains stable, with psychic distance modulated effectively to convey both procedural focus and dawning insight. The prose possesses a unique perceptual signature, particularly in its sensory details like the "filament-thin manipulator" and the "thrumming" resonance of the tapestry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is largely elegant and evocative. However, a significant flaw occurs with the line "Bronze quiet: the term described the atmosphere perfectly," an authorial intrusion that explains the metaphor it just deployed, breaking narrative immersion. This specific misstep, along with some minor "telling" at the start ("Her motivation was singular"), prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier, despite its many strengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the post-human archivist is a known trope, the story transforms it through a highly specific and ingenious synthesis of elements. The concept of a medieval tapestry encoding seismic data readable by a future historian is fresh and compelling. The story avoids cliché and builds a memorable world through its particular details, achieving a strong sense of originality.</comment>
