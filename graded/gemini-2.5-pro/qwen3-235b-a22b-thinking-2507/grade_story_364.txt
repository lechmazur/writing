<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is a flat vessel for the theme; the "skewed visionary" trait is asserted, not demonstrated, and she lacks a distinct voice or internal life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot relies on a series of extreme conveniences and a magical resolution that undermines any established tension. The cause-and-effect chain is tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The story feels reverse-engineered to include its required elements, resulting in a lack of cohesion between its sci-fi premise and its artisanal-philosophical resolution.</comment>
