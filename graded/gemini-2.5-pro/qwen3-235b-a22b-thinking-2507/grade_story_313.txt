<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The character's core conflict between remorse and defiance is well-realized, but the "unusually normal" attribute is stated more than demonstrated, feeling like a missed opportunity for subtler characterization through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story presents a remarkably complete and coherent emotional arc within the word count. The plot is driven by a clear internal cause-and-effect, creating a tight and satisfying narrative vignette.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength. The sensory details are concise, specific, and evocative, creating a bleak atmosphere that perfectly mirrors and enhances the character’s internal desperation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, particularly the use of the empty tape dispenser as a multi-layered symbol for the character's profession, guilt, and coping mechanism. The central theme of managing remorse rather than conquering it is nuanced and memorable.</comment>
