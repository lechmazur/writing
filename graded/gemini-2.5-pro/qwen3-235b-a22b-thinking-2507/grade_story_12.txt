<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character's initial "aloofness" feels more like a convenient label than a demonstrated trait, and the emotional shift from intellectual detachment to profound acceptance is too abrupt to be fully credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is structurally complete and coherent for its length, but the central epiphany and resolution occur with a swiftness that sacrifices emotional nuance for narrative efficiency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stark contrast between the sterile, futuristic mall and the vibrant, natural memory of the river is masterfully executed and serves as the story's strongest atmospheric and thematic pillar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While rich in symbolism, the narrative relies too heavily on telling the reader the character's emotions ("his resolve hardened," "he felt eager resignation") rather than showing them, which undermines the potential impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative combination is intriguing, but the execution leans on familiar tropes (a symbolic object healing grief; sterile future vs. natural past) and emotionally overwrought language that feels formulaic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story succeeds in cohesively weaving its many elements into a unified whole, but this technical success comes at the cost of subtlety, resulting in a narrative that feels more like a tidy exercise than an authentic human experience.</comment>
