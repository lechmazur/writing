<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation—to pursue non-violence—materializes too abruptly. It feels like an intellectual decision stated by the author rather than an earned, organic psychological shift for the character herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The internal plot arc is clear, but the pacing of the central epiphany is rushed. The leap from realizing the source of the whispers to dedicating herself to non-violence is too swift to be fully credible within the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully rendered and consistent, effectively linking the external grime of the city with the protagonist's internal state. The attic, in particular, is a potent symbolic space that grounds the story's central metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's central symbolism—the botanical samples as a map of violence—is exceptional and thoughtfully developed. The craft is high, though it occasionally over-explains its own metaphors, slightly diminishing the reader's work of discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the reinterpretation of "eliminate" is original, the story leans on familiar literary tropes (the sensitive poet-observer, the haunted attic as a psychological space) without fully subverting them, which slightly tempers its uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its disparate elements into a sophisticated thematic exploration. However, the intellectual ambition of the conclusion is not fully supported by the emotional journey, making the final vow feel more like a thesis statement than a lived resolution.</comment>
