<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aris is more of a function than a fully-realized character. While the internal state ('merry bitterness') is compelling, the character exists almost entirely to service the high-concept plot, leaving them feeling more like a vessel for the story's ideas than a person with discernible life beyond the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but overly linear and predictable. It follows a simple procedural arc (problem -> process -> awaited outcome) without surprise or reversal. The breakthrough feels inevitable rather than earned through a struggle against genuine, uncertain odds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strong but relies on some heavy-handed jargon ("psychic residue," "latent memory vault"). The central descriptive phrase, "uniformly peculiar," is an awkward and self-conscious construction that detracts from the otherwise evocative prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story's craft is commendable, but it over-explains its own symbolism (e.g., explicitly defining the wax shapes). This robs the narrative of potent subtext, trusting the reader too little and stating its themes too plainly for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the core concept is highly original, the execution has minor flaws that betray a formulaic underpinning. The repetition of key phrases ("slow drip," "scuffed charger plug") feels less like a deliberate motif and more like a constraint of vocabulary, preventing the prose from feeling truly flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in element integration, but it feels like a brilliant exercise. The seams are visible; the narrative seems constructed *around* the assigned parts rather than flowing from a deeper narrative necessity, making it feel impressive but emotionally and artistically constrained.</comment>
