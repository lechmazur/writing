<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is fierce and clear, and his defining trait—being “logically emotional”—is demonstrated effectively during the climax. He both calculates the necessary frequency and feels the Tower's pain, creating a compelling synthesis of skill and empathy. The characterization is strong, but slightly undercut by the explicit labeling of his internal state rather than allowing it to emerge purely from his actions and perceptions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The setup, escalation, and resolution follow a tight because/therefore logic from the faltering harmonics to the final earned stasis. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with a clear felt cost in Aris's exhaustion, and the final image of the restored Tower provides powerful resonance. The plot is perfectly scaled to the word count, demonstrating excellent structural control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not merely a backdrop but the story's primary antagonist, its "destructive harmonics" directly threatening the protagonist's goal. Sensory details like the "subsonic thrum that vibrated up... into his bones" are vivid and purposeful, grounding the conflict in a tangible, hostile environment. The setting actively constrains every choice, elevating it from description to a central narrative force that charges the final image of peaceful stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes—the shattering of the sacred lattice—are established immediately and feel immense. Pressure escalates effectively under a Causal lens through the "fleeting golden sunset," which serves as an excellent ticking clock. The conflict is resolved through the protagonist's direct agency and specific skill, and the cost is made legible in his final, slumped exhaustion. The tension is sustained beautifully from the first sentence to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of achieving harmony through precise adaptation rather than force emerges organically from the plot. However, the final line—"found absolution not for sins, but for the world's raw, trembling fragility"—is a thematic statement that borders on authorial moralizing. This over-articulation slightly diminishes the power of the resonant final image, stating what had already been powerfully implied and landing as a Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively modulate to match the rising tension of the scene, particularly during the ascent of the stairs. Aris's perception is convincingly filtered through his expertise as an engineer, making his internal experience specific and authoritative. There is minor friction from moments of over-explanation, but the voice remains compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often lands with vivid imagery ("azure coat flapping like a wounded bird"). However, it suffers from overwriting in several key moments, with dense clusters of adjectives and adverbs. There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as "His adaptation wasn't guesswork; it was precise vibrational matching," which state the same idea twice. These artifacts slightly blunt the story's momentum, particularly during the high-stakes climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a sonic lighthouse battling the resonant frequency of ice is highly original and well-realized. It transforms the classic "lonely guardian" trope into something fresh and conceptually fascinating. The story commits fully to its unique physics and resolves the conflict using the established rules, resulting in a narrative that feels both inventive and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
