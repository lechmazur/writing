<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and demonstrated through action rather than just statement. The concept of his "weightless burden" is established early and paid off effectively in the final lines, showing a credible change. His competence is balanced by the quiet sorrow of his gift, creating a well-rounded and compelling protagonist for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens; each discovery logically propels Silas to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change—freeing the spirit—that is earned entirely on the page through the protagonist's actions. The cost, the emotional weight of his gift, is legible and provides a resonant 'after' state for the character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is superb, functioning as both an atmospheric backdrop and an integral part of the plot's puzzle. Details like the "dust accumulation patterns" and the "smudge on a high shelf" are not mere description but are crucial clues. The environment actively constrains and enables the character's choices, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing the trapped spirit—is signaled clearly and escalates logically from a general investigation to a specific, personal task. The tightening is driven by Silas's agency as he deciphers the ghost's need. The resolution feels earned, and the story avoids coincidence, grounding the conflict in the protagonist's unique skills.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of releasing hidden sorrows is woven skillfully through the narrative, culminating in a powerful final image. While the "cracks in the façade" metaphor is slightly explicit, the closing beat—the ghost ascending "to see what ceilings truly hid"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a sophisticated thematic execution that avoids a simple moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, creating a narrative voice that is both observant and melancholic, perfectly suiting the character. Silas's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the decaying world through the lens of a technician diagnosing a failure. The prose has a controlled, consistent rhythm that reflects his methodical nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "the architecture of decay" and the sound of the bird's wings like "distant applause" are memorable and effective. While overwhelmingly strong, a few phrases like "lies beneath the painted smiles" verge on the familiar, a minor point in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's ingenuity lies in its synthesis of the ghost story with a blue-collar, problem-solving sensibility. The concept of an elevator technician whose diagnostic skills apply to the supernatural is a fresh and compelling transformation of the genre. The specific, grounded details of the puzzle prevent the story from feeling like a template, creating a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
