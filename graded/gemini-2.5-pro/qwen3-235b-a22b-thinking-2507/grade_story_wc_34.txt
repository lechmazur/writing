<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, and her arc from a silenced balladeer to a singer who bridges two worlds is earned and resonant. The internal conflict between her grief-induced silence and the ghost's plea for connection is compelling. However, interiority occasionally relies on summary, such as "Her motivation crystallized," which tells rather than embodies the shift, slightly undermining an otherwise strong and emotionally coherent character portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative-to-Causal structure, building atmosphere and knowledge before locking into a tight causal chain. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, on-page and with a clearly felt emotional cost for Elara. A persistent constraint—the ghost's ephemerality—drives the tactics involving the bolt plate, perfectly satisfying the conditions for exceptional structure at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, with the "misty courtyard" not just providing atmosphere but actively constraining the plot, as symbols are only visible when the vapor thins. The "flower press bolt plate" functions as a perfect micro-setting, a tangible tool that constrains and enables choice, acting as the physical anchor for an ephemeral being. Its presence is indispensable to the final, resonant image of the song taking form.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional control over conflict and stakes. The central stake of connection is signaled early and deepens beautifully, escalating from a simple need (*hunger*) to a profound, human desire (*Teach me to sing*). This escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency and choices, and the resolution is earned at the visible cost of overcoming her own years of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of connection, loneliness, and art's power to give voice to the unspoken emerge organically from the story’s central conceit. The subtextual parallel between the ghost's isolation and Elara's grief-choked silence is potent and resolves beautifully. The final image of the harmonizing song is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, though the final sentence slightly over-articulates the thematic conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, distinct, and maintains a consistent, close third-person POV that perfectly suits the story's tone. The narrator's perceptual signature is specific, focusing on the tactile and the ephemeral. The only minor friction is the repetition of the phrase "driftingly alert," which stands out in a piece of this length and feels slightly less economical than the surrounding prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. However, a few minor artifacts prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The repeated compound noun "Tinkersong wonder" and the summary phrase "Her motivation crystallized" are small instances of telling that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's originality lies in its superb synthesis of familiar sci-fi and fantasy elements into something fresh and emotionally resonant. The concept of a digital ghost communicating via ancient graffiti, requiring a physical, antique key for stabilization, is highly ingenious. This core premise feels specific and memorable, transforming a universal story of connection into a unique and compelling vision.</comment>
