<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character serves more as a vessel for the story's theme than as a nuanced individual. His motivation is explicitly stated rather than organically revealed, making him feel less like a person and more like a walking thesis statement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but almost entirely internal, culminating in a symbolic gesture rather than a significant narrative event. It functions more as a static vignette or character sketch than a story with compelling momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane, threadbare human scale with the cosmic grandeur of the nebula creates a powerful, contemplative atmosphere that is the story's most significant strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story suffers from being overly didactic. Its theme is stated and restated with such force that it sacrifices the subtlety and subtext expected of high-level literary fiction, telling the reader what to think rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution feels formulaic. The heavy-handed theming and forced, repetitive inclusion of key phrases (e.g., "impersonally personal") give the piece a self-conscious, engineered quality that undermines its authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story is a formidable exercise in cohesion, weaving its many parts together. However, this very tightness makes it feel like a sophisticated response to a prompt rather than an organic work, prioritizing its intellectual architecture over narrative spontaneity.</comment>
