<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is established early and drives her actions consistently. Her interiority is specific and her methods align with her character. The final epiphany feels earned by her process, but its articulation verges on over-explanation, slightly weakening the embodied nature of the change by summarizing it too neatly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building from observation to experiment to a climactic test. The structure is elegant and effective for the length. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing ("The living ones weren’t haunted; they were held"), which lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost—the weight of this new understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with evocative, specific sensory detail that creates a potent atmosphere. More importantly, the environment directly constrains and enables the plot: the bay provides the "displaced objects" (sea stone, orris root) that are the tools for her ritual. The cottages themselves function as the narrative's central challenge, making the setting indispensable to the story's core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stake—to understand the nature of a house's "spirit"—is clear and personal. The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens, moving from a null result (yellow cottage), to a positive confirmation (cedar bungalow), to the high-stakes test of the "dying" Finnegan place. This progression deepens the pressure and makes the final, fragile success feel earned, with the cost being the emotional weight of her discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of human care animating the inanimate is resonant and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters at the climax by explicitly stating its central discovery in a block of summary: "The understanding washed over her... houses felt alive because they were sanctified by the displaced objects of human care." This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext, explaining the moral rather than allowing the final image of the waking house to convey it alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature that perfectly matches the protagonist's characterization as a "noticer." The point of view is controlled with no psychic distance errors. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the building tension, particularly in the final scene at the Finnegan house, showing a high degree of narrative control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and striking images ("streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). However, there is a tendency toward over-writing, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes slows momentum. A sentence like "The contrast was stark, profound, yet she hadn’t sought it; it revealed itself inadvertently as she worked" reads as authorial scaffolding that could be trimmed for greater impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's central premise—sanctifying spaces with "displaced objects" to reveal their connection to human care—is a highly original and ingenious transformation of the haunted house trope. It synthesizes magical realism with a deep emotional truth. The execution feels particular to this character and world, creating a memorable and non-obvious narrative.</comment>
