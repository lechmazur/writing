<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a vessel for the story's high-concept theme than a fully realized individual. Motivation is clear, but the 'singularly plural' attribute is explained rather than embodied, leaving her feeling more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story executes a clean, coherent arc within the word count. However, the core mechanism—transmuting a DNA sequence into a shame-breaking vibration via a brass bell—is a work of techno-magic that strains credulity, even for the genre. The radio broadcast deadline feels arbitrary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength, with evocative, specific sensory details creating a potent cyberpunk mood. The setting is actively integrated into the climax, with the neon orchard responding to the change, which is a sophisticated touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly the central metaphor of shame as a genetic pattern. The story shows a clear theme and achieves a satisfying, quiet resolution. However, the prose, while skillful, occasionally verges on being overly explanatory of its own symbolism ("testament to passionate subtlety").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central concept is brilliantly original. However, the execution feels almost too polished, lacking the idiosyncratic voice of a singular author. Some phrases ("singularly personal yet universally imposed") read like thematic summaries, giving it a slightly sterile, formula-perfected quality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story succeeds in cohesively weaving its many disparate elements into a functional and imaginative whole. The core weakness is that it reads like a masterfully executed response to a prompt, where the cleverness of the integration slightly overshadows the raw, human element.</comment>
