<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The character's philosophical shift is the story's core, but it occurs too rapidly, feeling more like a convenient plot device than an earned, nuanced development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story executes a complete and coherent arc within the word limit, but the resolution relies on an overly convenient memory trigger that undermines the buildup of tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of a high-tech crystal embassy and humble, naturalistic elements creates a strong initial atmosphere, though the world itself remains a shallow backdrop for the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story's impact is severely weakened by a didactic approach that explicitly tells the reader the moral, rather than showing it through subtle action and subtext, which is a significant craft failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a predictable "logic vs. emotion" trope without subversion, and its structure feels formulaic, as if executing a template rather than demonstrating unique authorial insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the assigned elements are woven together into a cohesive whole, the story feels more like a well-executed technical exercise than a work of profound creative depth, lacking the subtlety for top-tier publication.</comment>
