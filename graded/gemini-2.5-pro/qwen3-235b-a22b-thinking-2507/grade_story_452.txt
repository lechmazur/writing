<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "detective" profession serves only as a generic cyberpunk backdrop rather than being meaningfully integrated into his personality or the central action. His core struggle is entirely separate from his stated job.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and well-paced, but the plot's turning point—a projector being realigned by finger-tracing and floor-pressing—requires a significant suspension of disbelief. This core mechanism feels more like convenient sentimentality than sound internal logic, weakening the entire structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest feature, effectively contrasting the sterile cyberpunk city with the dusty, sacred space of the planetarium. However, the depiction of the city relies heavily on established genre shorthand ("neon-drenched," "sterile chrome") without adding much novelty to the aesthetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, with powerful, consistent symbolism (buckle, stars, weaving). The central theme is clear and resonant. However, the story occasionally over-explains its own metaphors, particularly in the final paragraphs, which slightly diminishes its impact by not fully trusting the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the prose is polished and avoids formulaic pitfalls, the story's foundation is built on familiar tropes (hopepunk rebellion in a dystopia, the sad cyberpunk detective). The originality is in the quietness of the execution, not in the core concepts, and the resolution feels more like a fable than a fresh narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece is remarkably cohesive, weaving its disparate elements into a unified, evocative whole. The brevity feels intentional and effective. Its primary failing, preventing it from reaching the highest tier, is the sentimental and physically implausible plot resolution, which feels too 'soft' for its otherwise gritty and melancholic world.</comment>
