<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative, but the assigned role of "lookout" feels discordant with her actual duties of cleaning, mending, and emotional intervention. Her actions, while thematically consistent, verge on melodramatic (the phone-crushing), making her feel more like a symbolic vessel for the theme than a fully nuanced individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story presents a clear arc, but its central plot mechanism is logically tenuous. The connection between "analyzing fleeting glimpses" of digital activity and the solution of "physical mending" is purely metaphorical. The plot asks the reader to accept that one magically solves the other without establishing any coherent cause-and-effect, which undermines its structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The juxtaposition of an ancient Roman villa with the anxieties of a digital detox center creates a potent, original atmosphere. Sensory details are specific and evocative, masterfully building a world where the tension between the tangible past and the spectral present is palpable. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the story's central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is undeniable, with strong, resonant metaphors (digital poltergeists, server farm sanctuary) and memorable phrases ("ruthless kindness"). However, the story's theme is so foregrounded that it borders on being didactic. It sacrifices subtlety for impact, functioning more as a beautifully written parable than a layered narrative, which slightly lessens its staying power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept of digital anxiety manifesting as a literal haunting is highly original and executed with a distinct authorial voice. The language is fresh and avoids clich√©. The primary weakness is the character's hyper-competence and the plot's overly tidy resolution, which feels formulaic in its neatness and detracts from the messy, nuanced reality the story otherwise seeks to champion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A cohesive and conceptually brilliant piece of flash fiction that is slightly let down by a central plot point that relies on metaphor rather than logic. While the prose is sharp and the atmosphere is superb, the convenient resolution and the aforementioned logical gap would be significant points of contention for publication at the highest level. It's memorable and intelligent, but not flawless.</comment>
