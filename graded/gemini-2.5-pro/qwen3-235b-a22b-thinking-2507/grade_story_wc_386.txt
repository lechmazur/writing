<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “salvage something pure” is compelling and provides a strong throughline. Her interiority is concrete, and her emotional arc culminates in the embodied response of “Tears froze on Elara’s cheeks,” which feels earned. The final choice to place the globe in the shrine is a perfect physical expression of her internal resolution, demonstrating a meaningful change with a clear felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal drive. Each dream fragment serves as a premise leading to a specific deduction, building a logical chain that culminates in the climax. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the snow globe is re-framed from a broken relic to a vessel for a pure memory, landing with the distinct emotional cost of the tragic truth. The structure is tight, efficient, and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both crucible and character. The "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" creates a potent atmosphere of stillness and cold reverence that mirrors Elara's work. Crucially, the melted snow globe acts as a micro-setting that is not merely described but actively constrains the central investigation and charges the final, resonant image, making the environment indispensable to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central stake—uncovering the true reason for the sinking to grant peace—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict escalates internally as Elara’s knowledge deepens, with each dream fragment acting as a tightening of the mystery. The final revelation is a powerful turn driven entirely by her agency, and the cost is the palpable weight of the crew's collective shame, made legible in Elara’s tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging purity from shame is beautifully developed through the central symbol of the snow globe. The final image, where the globe "looked like a promise," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is warranted for the last paragraph's tendency to state its own conclusion ("She had woven the fractured narrative into something whole"), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that feels both intimate and slightly mythic. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical texture ("crushing dark," "borrowed starlight") that perfectly matches the story's tone without becoming overwrought. The prose rhythmically supports the contemplative and revelatory beats, demonstrating a high level of control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong, evocative imagery ("cloudy amber tear," "piano wire, snapping taut"). However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final paragraphs by sentences that summarize the story’s effect rather than letting the final image do the work (e.g., "The ghosts below would rest easier now, their secret exposed..."). This explanatory impulse is the primary weakness in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" with the novel mechanic of analyzing "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" is highly original and compelling. The story fully commits to this premise, using it to transform a familiar maritime tragedy into something fresh and psychologically insightful. The result feels unique and inevitable, showcasing significant ingenuity.</comment>
