<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The 'lovelorn' aspect is well-realized through the recipe obsession, but the 'spy' identity feels like underutilized backstory rather than a fully integrated, active trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a compelling, self-contained arc within the word count, using the climactic siren as an effective pivot point from introspection to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, using potent sensory details (taste of noodles, sound of sirens) to create a thick, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The piece is elevated by its strong use of symbolism (label, reflection) and a central, resonant metaphor (the avalanche) that unifies the internal and external conflicts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While using familiar cyberpunk tropes (cyber-eyes, neon slums), the story repurposes them to serve a poignant, human narrative of grief, avoiding a purely formulaic feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving disparate elements into a thematically unified whole, though the 'spy' component feels less essential than the others.</comment>
