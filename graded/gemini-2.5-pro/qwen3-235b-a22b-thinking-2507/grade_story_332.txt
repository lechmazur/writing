<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's arc is clear and emotionally resonant, but the motivation for her change—the station's decommission order—feels like an external convenience forcing an internal breakthrough, rather than a purely organic evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and coherent arc within the word count. However, its structure is so classically perfect that it verges on the predictable, lacking the structural risk or innovation expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere of 'intimate separation' is masterfully rendered, with the exo-garden serving as a potent symbol. The core metaphor of a fragile biosphere mirroring the protagonist, while effective, is a familiar sci-fi trope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the use of symbolism. Its only minor flaw is a tendency to explicitly state its themes (e.g., "resuscitation of self"), momentarily telling the reader what was already being powerfully shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the prose is elegant and avoids cliché, the story's core narrative—the blocked artist finding their authentic voice through a final catharsis—is a well-worn trope that isn't subverted in a truly original way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally cohesive, with all elements serving a unified purpose. It is a work of immense polish and craft, but its very perfection and adherence to a classic emotional arc makes it feel safe rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
