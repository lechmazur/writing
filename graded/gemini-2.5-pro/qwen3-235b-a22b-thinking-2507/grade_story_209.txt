<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but his internal journey is overwrought and explicitly stated ("the admission finally surfaced," "Grief... surged") rather than shown, which robs the character of nuance and depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete for the word count, but the climax—hearing a ghostly voice in the echo—is a sentimental contrivance that undermines the story's grounded, gritty emotional core.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" is a superb, original setting. The atmosphere is thick with sensory detail (ozone, static, bruised twilight) that powerfully externalizes the character's internal state of decay and confused signals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the use of symbolism is strong, the craft falters at key moments. The explicit declaration of emotional states and the clichéd resolution (the forgiving ghost-voice) prevent the story from achieving genuine emotional resonance, settling for sentimentality instead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story's core concept and setting are wonderfully original, but it collapses into trope at the climax. The "I know" from a ghostly presence is a tired device that feels unearned and detracts from the otherwise unique narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates a remarkable ability to weave disparate elements into a cohesive whole, but it lacks the final measure of discipline. It sacrifices gritty emotional truth for a convenient, sentimental ending, which is a critical failure for a work aspiring to this level.</comment>
