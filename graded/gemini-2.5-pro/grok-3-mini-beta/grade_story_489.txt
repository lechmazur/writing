<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'unseen observer' remains entirely abstract, lacking tangible presence or development beyond stated attributes like 'aggressively kind' and 'brazen calm', which feel asserted rather than demonstrated. Motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or nuanced connection to the symbolic action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a symbolic action triggered by an external event (whale call), creating a loose cause-effect chain. However, the connection between the dancer's memory, the eroding traditions, and the whistle-fling feels conceptually overloaded and lacks narrative inevitability within the compressed space. The arc is present but feels rushed and overly reliant on abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is effectively evoked with strong atmospheric details ("dim, fog-shrouded," "spectral winds"). The contrast between the ancient setting and the "basic plastic whistle" creates an interesting, albeit slightly jarring, symbolic tension. The atmosphere strongly supports the mystical and urgent tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story attempts significant symbolic weight (whistle, dancer, whale song, wisdom) and uses elevated language, but often veers into telling rather than showing ("observer understood," "wisdom revealed itself"). The central conflict (loss of tradition) is clear, but its resolution via whistle feels allegorical rather than narratively earned. Impact is intellectual rather than emotional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive, somewhat artificial phrasing ("undercurrent of wisdom," "brazen calm," "aggressively kind") and a tendency towards ornate description that feels generic rather than specific ("spectral winds whispered secrets"). The abstract character and symbolic action lack human nuance, feeling closer to an algorithmic assembly of concepts than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story struggles under the weight of its assigned elements; they feel more like constraints dictating the narrative than integral parts of an organic whole. The density of abstract concepts and symbolic actions within the brief word count hinders clarity and emotional resonance, leaving a feeling of forced significance.</comment>
