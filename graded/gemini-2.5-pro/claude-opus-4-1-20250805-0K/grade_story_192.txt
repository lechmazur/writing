<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character attribute "lookout" is a poor fit for Marcus's actions, which are more archival and introspective. His sister's "ruthless kindness" is an intriguing concept but remains underdeveloped, rendering her more a plot device than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete and coherent within the tight word limit. The central mechanism—analyzing poltergeist activity—is high-concept but follows its own internal logic, driving the narrative from mystery to a clear and satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength. The "bio-integrated architecture" is not mere setting but the central engine of the plot, creating a unique and deeply resonant atmosphere where the environment itself becomes a character and a repository of memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates excellent craft, particularly in its use of the central symbolism of the breathing villa and the sewing box. The final moment achieves genuine emotional impact, successfully translating the high-concept premise into a tangible, human resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the prose is polished and the combination of elements is unique, the core theme of human connection versus digital alienation is a well-worn trope in speculative fiction. The story's execution is fresh, but its foundational idea lacks groundbreaking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story feels exceptionally cohesive, with the disparate assigned elements integrated so seamlessly that they appear to have been conceived together. The narrative functions as a potent, self-contained vignette, using its constraints to create focus rather than feeling limited by them.</comment>
