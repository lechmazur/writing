<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivation is expertly established and sustained through her meticulous, embodied actions. Her character is revealed through her competence and the subtle internal conflict shown when she sees the good futures she must also sacrifice ("loves that would never bloom"). This glimpse of cost adds significant depth, earning the final image of solitary peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through the intensification of a single, continuous process. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the cost of lost potential futures made explicit on the page. The final image of footprints being washed away acts as a perfect Conceptual Repricing of her ephemeral, vital work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but is an indispensable tool for the plot's resolution. The "nocturnal haven" is her source of power, and the brook is the active mechanism for dispersing the prophecy. This integration of setting and action is seamless, elevating the environment from a backdrop to a core narrative component, satisfying the 9+ gate with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are handled with masterful subtlety. The dominant stake—preserving the present's balance—is clear, and pressure escalates as the prophecy actively "struggled against her work." The protagonist's agency is absolute, and the resolution is earned directly through her efforts, with the cost of her victory being poignantly and explicitly rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict, exploring the weighty responsibility of choosing between a known present and an unknown, potentially greater future. The piece avoids simple moralizing, embracing the complex cost of the summoner's choice. The final image of the brook offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about legacy and unseen guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical, confident, and perfectly sustained, establishing a tone of ancient competence and tranquility. The POV is flawlessly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through the lens of her unique craft (e.g., "Moth-thoughts and owl-dreams"). The prose rhythm and diction are masterfully aligned with the character's focused, ritualistic actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Figurative language ("pockets of concentrated quiet that hung in the air like invisible fruit") is both beautiful and precise, enhancing meaning rather than merely decorating the prose. The piece is entirely free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts, reading as polished and deliberate from start to finish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of redirecting or "silencing" a prophecy, rather than destroying or succumbing to it, is an ingenious and fresh angle on a classic fantasy trope. The originality is cemented by the specific, nature-based magic system that feels both novel and deeply intuitive. The story takes the risk of being quiet and procedural, and the payoff is a unique and memorable narrative experience.</comment>
