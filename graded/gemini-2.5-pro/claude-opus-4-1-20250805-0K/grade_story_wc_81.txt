<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her competence is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The characterization is strong, though it stops just short of greatness because her internal state, while consistent, lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse. The phrase "dappled resolve, neither entirely certain nor wholly doubtful" provides a welcome touch of complexity to an otherwise seamlessly proficient character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's causal chain is flawless and elegant. The blackout enables the inciting incident, the discovery of a sophisticated forgery method tightens the plot, and the returning power provides a perfect ticking clock. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with a clear, felt cost: the work is incomplete, and the struggle is ongoing. This structure is a model of economy and impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a triumph of world-building through specific, functional detail. It's not just atmospheric; it's the engine of the plot. The phosphorescent algae provide the necessary light for the special ink, the "reclaimed stillness" enables the protagonist's core skill, and the submerged nature necessitates the vacuum-sealed books. The environment is an active and indispensable constraint that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The conflict escalates with precision. The stakes move from a general task (verifying books) to a specific discovery (sophisticated forgeries) and finally to a moral imperative (uncovering a corporate conspiracy). The time pressure from the returning generators is executed perfectly, forcing a climax where the cost—an incomplete but meaningful victory—is palpable. The protagonist's agency drives every beat of this intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of analog persistence versus digital fragility is beautifully integrated without a single line of overt moralizing. It emerges organically from the contrast between the ancient stamp and the failed databases, and the patient, sensory work versus the "constant noise" of the electronic world. The final image of glowing ink hidden beneath a fully-powered surface world provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, controlled, and perfectly matched to the protagonist's "tranquilly perceptive" nature. The close third-person POV is maintained without flaw, creating a distinct and immersive perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is measured and elegant, modulating slightly as the time pressure increases, demonstrating excellent control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and evocative phrasing ("sang a different frequency," "reclaimed stillness"). Each sentence serves a clear purpose, advancing the narrative with a clean, propulsive rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought metaphors, resulting in a piece that is both beautiful and surgically precise at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept—a librarian who "listens" to the authenticity of books in a sunken city—is brilliantly original. It synthesizes sci-fi, archival procedural, and a hint of the mystical into a fresh and memorable premise. The story fully commits to its unique logic, transforming a familiar "saving knowledge" trope into something specific, tangible, and deeply resonant.</comment>
