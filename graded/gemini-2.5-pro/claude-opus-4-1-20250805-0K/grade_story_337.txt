<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as a strong symbol for the theme but lacks the deep, personal interiority needed for a top-tier character; she feels more like an archetypal sage than a unique individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a masterfully executed vignette, achieving a sense of completeness and a clear arc within the severe word constraint; the pacing is excellent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion with all elements serving the central theme, but its lack of narrative subtlety holds it back from immediate, flawless publishability.</comment>
