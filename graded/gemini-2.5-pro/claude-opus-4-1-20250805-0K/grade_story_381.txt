<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character is exceptionally consistent; her 'hushed' nature informs her entire methodology. However, the portrayal prioritizes dedication over a deeper internal complexity, leaving her emotional state just shy of fully transparent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The structure is a masterclass in miniature. It presents a complete narrative and emotional arc within the tight word count, using the subtle interpretation of 'dominate' as the quiet, inevitable conclusion to her work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is seamless, blending futuristic sci-fi, fantasy, and mundane nostalgia into a single, cohesive atmosphere. The crystalline cave is not mere backdrop but an active participant in the story's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the use of subtext and symbolism (the cap, the movies). The story's true conflict is internal—legacy and grief—and the ending lands with immense thematic weight by turning a world-building detail ("the sound of resolve") into the character's defining moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise is startlingly original, defying genre conventions by applying necromancy to a scientific, non-violent pursuit. The voice is distinct and the emotional beats are earned through nuanced interaction, not formulaic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is a rare example of constraint-based writing where the elements feel discovered rather than assigned. The story is a cohesive, emotionally resonant whole that feels deliberate and impactful, leaving a lingering sense of melancholic purpose.</comment>
