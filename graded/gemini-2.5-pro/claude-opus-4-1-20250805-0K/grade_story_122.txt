<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The character is a functional archetype who serves the plot but lacks genuine interiority; his defining trait ("patiently frantic") is stated rather than demonstrated through action, diminishing its impact and making him a mere vessel for the story's concepts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendably complete arc within the word count, but the pacing is so accelerated that the climax lacks dramatic weight, feeling more like a summary of a pivotal event than a lived, tense experience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its atmosphere; the fusion of ancient mysticism (sky burial) and high-concept sci-fi (cyber-templar) creates a powerfully evocative and original world, grounded in specific, resonant sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative craft suffers from a critical failure to 'show' rather than 'tell.' It repeatedly and explicitly states its complex themes and the character's emotions, sacrificing narrative subtlety and reader discovery for blunt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the conceptual blend is highly original, the execution feels synthetic. The prose relies on overwrought emotional descriptors ("tears of electric joy") and a tendency to explain its own cleverness, which suggests a formulaic construction rather than an organic narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>An ambitious and creative synthesis of disparate elements is ultimately undermined by an execution that prioritizes explaining its premise over immersive storytelling, leaving the piece feeling like a compelling pitch for a story rather than the story itself.</comment>
