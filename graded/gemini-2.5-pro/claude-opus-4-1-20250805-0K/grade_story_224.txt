<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's core contradiction ("openly private") is a strong concept, but it is explicitly stated rather than purely demonstrated, a small instance of telling that slightly undermines the characterization for a top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and resonant arc within the word limit, with effective pacing that moves from stillness to chaos and back to a magical stasis. The structure is nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a standout strength, using the contrast between the chaotic scale of the giant's world and the minstrel's quiet purpose to create a palpable and immersive sense of tension and wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's craft is excellent, using layered symbolism and a powerful central metaphor for artistic purpose. Its impact is only slightly lessened by a few declarative sentences that tell the reader what to think ("he understood").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates high originality, combining familiar fantasy elements in a fresh and unexpected way. The magical system, based on the memory of a meteorite's texture, is particularly inventive and memorable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally cohesive, with all assigned elements seamlessly integrated in service of a profound central theme. It feels like a deliberate and polished prose poem, leaving a lingering, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
