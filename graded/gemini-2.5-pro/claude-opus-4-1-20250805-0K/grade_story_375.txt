<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is a compelling archetype, but her internal world is asserted rather than shown; the "fury" and connection to the star feel like lore, not a lived-in psychological state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The world is a significant strength, providing a powerfully evocative and thematically resonant canvas. The atmosphere is thick and purposeful, directly serving the core concept.</comment>
