<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but the core attribute "righteously flawed" is asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the internal conflict feeling underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete for the length, but the resolution is too swift and tidy, lessening the impact of the twelve years of established fear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conceptual blend is highly original, but the execution relies on stating emotional shifts rather than showing them through nuanced action, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The components are integrated with exceptional skill, but the piece reads more like a high-concept summary than a nuanced literary work due to a lack of subtlety in conveying character and theme.</comment>
