<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character concept is superb, but the stated motivation ("preserve ancient practices") is slightly less compelling than the demonstrated emotional driver ("jubilant remorse"), creating a minor dissonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a tightly constructed and complete micro-arc. Its primary weakness is that the external conflict with tech companies is entirely backstory, lacking immediate narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph, born from the masterful juxtaposition of ancient ritual and digital decay. The server room setting could have been rendered with slightly more sensory detail to heighten this contrast even further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft is sophisticated, with a memorable central theme and potent imagery. It is slightly weakened by a single sentence that explicitly tells the reader the core emotion ("This jubilant remorse powered her work") instead of relying solely on showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept is exceptionally original, brilliantly blending genres and subverting tropes. The synthesis of ancient magic and near-obsolete technology feels entirely fresh and visionary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An excellent, cohesive piece of flash fiction that feels deliberate and impactful. It successfully transforms its required elements into the very fabric of a unique narrative, leaving a profound, lingering impression.</comment>
