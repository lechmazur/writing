<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's core assigned attribute, "mild zealot," is stated but not convincingly demonstrated; his actions read as melancholic and academic rather than zealous, making his portrayal feel more like a vessel for the theme than a fully realized personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surprisingly complete and satisfying arc within the word count, moving from contemplation to a firm resolution. The external pressure of the investors provides a clear, effective stake that drives the internal conflict to a conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength. The "Strange Attractor Laboratory" is a highly original, evocative setting that perfectly merges scientific and philosophical themes, creating a powerful, immersive atmosphere that is integral to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly in its use of symbolism (the currencies, the attractors) to explore a profound theme. The narrative operates on multiple levels of meaning, and the ending provides a thoughtful, resonant closure to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels highly original due to its unique synthesis of chaos theory, economics, and legacy. The prose is distinctive and avoids clich√©, successfully subverting the "lonely genius" trope with a fresh intellectual and emotional context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its disparate assigned elements into a seamless and purposeful whole. It feels less like an exercise in fulfilling prompts and more like a deliberate, polished work of flash fiction with a lingering intellectual and emotional impact.</comment>
