<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and his professional competence ("skillfully observant") is demonstrated through action, not just stated. His progression from investigator to the bearer of a legacy is earned. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier by a lack of sharp internal conflict; his path to discovery is linear and competent, with minimal self-doubt or contradictory impulses shown in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Causal lens. Every beat follows logically from the last: the light fails, which reveals the ghost, whose repetitive action provides clues, which leads to the journal. The closure is a powerful combination of a Decisive Change (Marcus has a new mission) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghosts fade), with the felt cost of the "weightless burden" he now carries. This is an exceptionally well-structured piece for its length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and integral to the plot. Details like the loose floorboard and the ceiling tiles are not mere description but active components of the discovery process. The horologist's mainspring barrel serves as a perfect micro-setting/charged object, its state changing at the climax to constrain and confirm Marcus’s understanding. The environment directly enables the story's resolution, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind systemic corruption—is signaled early and escalates perfectly from a single haunting to a city-wide conspiracy involving Marcus's own family. The deepening is driven entirely by his agency and choices. The cost is clearly articulated in the final beats as the responsibility he inherits, a burden that gives the resolution its weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of exposing hidden truths ("cracks in the facade") is woven seamlessly through the plot. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from concrete actions and images. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme with "every broken thing could still be fixed," but frames it as the mainspring's "whispered promise," skillfully pulling it back into character perception rather than authorial statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on mechanical details and the subtle language of the dead. The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and has a melancholic rhythm that perfectly matches the story's tone. Minimal dialogue is used for maximum impact, particularly the line, "You were buying silence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Images like the "dying wasp trapped in glass" and "pages yellow as old teeth" are vivid and precise. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, and the rhythm of the sentences effectively carries the story's momentum from investigation to quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a mechanic who sees ghosts drawn to mechanical failures is a highly original and ingenious synthesis of the supernatural and the procedural. It re-contextualizes a common trope into something specific and logical within its own world. The execution feels entirely fresh, particularly the clever use of dust patterns as a forensic tool, making the story memorable and distinct.</comment>
