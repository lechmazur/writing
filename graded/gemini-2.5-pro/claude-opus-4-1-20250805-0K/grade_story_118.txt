<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character concepts are brilliant and unique (a hive-mind therapist), but the execution remains slightly more intellectual than deeply emotional. Their motivations are clear, but the inner life feels sketched rather than fully inhabited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in narrative efficiency, presenting a complete and coherent arc within the severe word constraint. The central action (drain) is used thematically to drive both character and plot forward with impressive sophistication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph. The world-building is evocative and seamlessly integrated, using specific sensory details like the dripping wax and the cutting plug prongs to make its high-concept reality feel palpable and immediate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, particularly the use of potent symbolism (the wax code, the charger plug) and a final sentence that is both poetic and thematically resonant. The dialogue is sharp and purposeful, wasting no words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, combining disparate, strange concepts into a cohesive and fresh narrative. The prose avoids clich√© and establishes a unique voice, particularly in its central conceit of "the sound of hindsight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements together not just competently but synergistically. The brevity feels like a deliberate, impactful choice, creating a vignette that is dense with meaning and lingers long after reading.</comment>
