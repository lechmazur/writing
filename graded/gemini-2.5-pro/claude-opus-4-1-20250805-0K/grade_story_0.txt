<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's 'sheepish' nature is well-realized, but the 'analytically creative' attribute is merely stated, not demonstrated; his solution relies on a magical heirloom, not a clever puzzle-solving process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a remarkably complete and satisfying arc within the word count. The pacing is excellent, moving from infiltration to confrontation and resolution with no wasted words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core irony of the setting—a data analysis center oblivious to the mythic pattern beneath it—is brilliantly conceived and executed, creating a superb, layered atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong and the voice distinct, but the central theme, while clear, is delivered with a slightly heavy hand (e.g., "symbiotic relationship abandoned when streaming services made storytelling cheap").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blend of bureaucratic satire, spy fiction, and cosmic horror is highly original and witty. The voice feels unique, successfully subverting the tropes it employs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is inventive and largely cohesive, but is held back from perfection by the explicit narration of the character's internal changes ("Morrow's evolving hopes crystallized") instead of showing them organically.</comment>
