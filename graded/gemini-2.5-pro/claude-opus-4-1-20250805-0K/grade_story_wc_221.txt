<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her relationship with her grandmother. The internal conflict—accepting her "curse" as a tool—is resolved through a well-earned epiphany, making her final choice to become a "lighthouse" feel both inevitable and costly. Her interiority is concrete and specific, avoiding generic emotional labels; the transition from blessed pariah to purposeful anchor is powerful and earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, where emotional and conceptual weight builds to a cathartic final action. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing ("The temporal stretching wasn't a curse. It was a compass") that enables a Decisive Change (drawing the map), is rendered on the page with a clear, felt cost—her willing acceptance of permanent, purposeful isolation. The structure is elegant, using a single scene and a perfectly integrated reflective block to achieve its effect without a single wasted move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and deeply functional. The observation deck, as a void between moments, perfectly externalizes the story's core problem. The "gilded compass rose applique" acts as a micro-setting that is absolutely essential to the plot, constraining choice and directly charging the final image of remembered starlight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, creating a palpable sense of loss and eventual, quiet hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful, station-wide stake (a thousand lost souls) and makes it personal to Kira. The key pressure point is a deepening of understanding rather than an external event, which perfectly suits the drive lens. Her final act of agency is a direct result of this internal shift, resolving the conflict at a significant personal cost: she saves her crew but solidifies her role as a pariah, now a willing one. The escalation is subtle but undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding an internal "true north" is beautifully integrated through the grandmother's legacy and the central metaphor of navigation. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into thematic summary with lines like "Sometimes the only way home was to become home for others..." This direct statement slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtlety, constituting a 'Thematic Echo' that prevents a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that is both intimate and lyrical. The voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature; Kira's world is filtered through concepts of time, memory, and navigation. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with her internal state, from quiet reflection to the confident focus of her final act. It's a confident, immersive, and unwavering narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery ("pulled thin like taffy," "swimmers through honey"). There are no significant loops or scaffolding issues. The only slight weakness is a minor register drift in the penultimate paragraph, where the language becomes slightly more abstract and declarative ("to transform isolation into a lighthouse, confusion into exploration") than the concrete, sensory prose that precedes it. This minor slip is the only thing holding it back from a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>While stories about navigating temporal anomalies exist, the synthesis here is fresh and powerful. The fusion of hard sci-fi concepts with the soft, generational tradition of sketching constellations on rice paper is an ingenious and emotionally resonant choice. The story transforms the "cursed chosen one" trope by making the curse the very tool of salvation, a re-framing that feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
