<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is well-established, but her defining attribute ("fiercely gentle") is explicitly stated twice, a case of telling over showing that a top-tier publication would flag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is solid, but its central turning point relies on the extreme convenience of the painter possessing the one perfect secret needed to diagnose and potentially fix the Mars situation, which strains credulity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength; the "exo-atmospheric garden" and the tone of "intimate separation" are interwoven with masterful, evocative details that create a powerful and cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally high, with potent symbolism (notepad vs. failing tech) and resonant imagery, though the final line "The orchids would survive; they always did" feels like an unearned, slightly clich√©d platitude that undercuts her sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels highly original in its blending of intimate, analogue humanity with a sci-fi setting, avoiding formula. However, the "self-sacrificing artist" is a familiar trope, even if handled with nuance here.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and powerful, with most elements serving a clear purpose. It's held back from the highest echelon only by a reliance on a convenient plot device (the perfect secret) and moments of telling instead of showing.</comment>
