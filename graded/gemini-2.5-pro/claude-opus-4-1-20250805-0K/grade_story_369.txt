<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character is a strong, well-realized concept, but the assigned attribute "optimistically bitter" is stated rather than fully embodied. It feels like an intellectual label rather than a trait that consistently informs his actions and internal state, which leans more towards weary obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story possesses a flawless micro-arc with excellent pacing and coherence. However, the central revelation—that the puzzle was about the protagonist himself all along—is a familiar narrative trope, which slightly diminishes its impact at the highest literary level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The integration of the lighthouse setting, the character's obsessive isolation, and the story's themes is nearly perfect. The atmosphere is thick and purposeful, with evocative imagery ("metallic vines," "tired ghost") that powerfully enhances the narrative's mood and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional craft through potent symbolism and thematic depth. Its primary weakness is a tendency to occasionally 'tell' the reader the meaning behind the devices and motivations, rather than allowing these concepts to be revealed entirely through subtext and action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>While the story utilizes recognizable tropes (the isolated genius, the mysterious benefactor), it revitalizes them with highly original specifics and sophisticated concepts. The language is fresh and avoids cliché, resulting in a narrative that feels distinct and authored, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This is a highly cohesive and intelligent piece where all elements serve the central theme with remarkable synergy. It achieves a resonant, atmospheric quality that lingers, demonstrating a command of craft that is only a hair's breadth away from flawless execution.</comment>
