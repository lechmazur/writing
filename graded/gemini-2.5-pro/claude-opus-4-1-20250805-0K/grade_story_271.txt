<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characterization is evocative and serves the theme, but Mortis remains more of a stylish archetype than a psychologically deep individual, a potential weakness for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent, a perfectly executed narrative loop. Its near-flawless mechanical construction, while impressive, risks feeling more like a beautiful artifice than an organic story.</comment>
