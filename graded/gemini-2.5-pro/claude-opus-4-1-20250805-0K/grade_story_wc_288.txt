<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and compelling, rooted in the specific conflict between her ancient memories and modern isolation. The primary weakness is the articulation of her epiphany, which verges on diagnostic self-awareness. The exchange with Marcus ("We're here to coexist with its absence." / "Independence from our old roles...") feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, messy moment of realization, slightly flattening the peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is an elegant single scene, with pressure building via the humming circle. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kira accepts her new identity and can "cast a shadow," is on the page and carries the felt cost of accepting permanent loss. The final image provides a perfect, visible manifestation of the internal change, fully satisfying the requirements for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, a masterclass in world-building economy. The Tidal Library is not just a location but a participant in the narrative, breathing and shifting with the atmospheric tides and Kira's internal state. The brass sundial and the glowing stone circle are not mere props; they are integral tools that constrain and enable the character's journey, directly charging the final, resonant image of the shadow. This is setting as a crucible for character change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story excels at dramatizing a quiet, internal conflict. The dominant stake—transforming isolation into independence—is clear from the start. Pressure escalates effectively through the increasing hum of the stone circle, forcing Kira toward a resolution. The final turn is a powerful crystallization of her stance, earned through reflection and culminating in a choice to "coexist with absence," with the cost being the full acceptance of what is lost forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of reconciling with an irrevocable past to find a new purpose is handled with subtlety and power through the story's imagery. However, the score is capped by the dialogue at the climax. Kira's line, "We weren't preserved to recreate the past... We're here to coexist with its absence," is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the 'show, don't tell' principle. While the final image of the shadow is a superb, non-literal answer, the preceding on-the-nose summary prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the story's melancholic and wondrous tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Kira's unique experience as a mammoth herder in a modern age. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, bringing us close to Kira's internal state without ever feeling overwrought. The dialogue, while thematically direct, is consistent with the established reflective voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, evocative imagery, and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "The brass sundial caught no shadows in the Tidal Library, where clouds rolled beneath the glass floor like forgotten seas" establish world, tone, and conflict with remarkable efficiency. The prose is clean, with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience from the first line to the last.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates extraordinary originality by synthesizing high-concept science fiction with deep-time prehistory. The core premise—reincarnated specialists of extinct arts and roles finding their place in the modern world—is fresh and thought-provoking. Every element, from the tidal library to the time-reflecting sundial, feels both unique and thematically inevitable, transforming familiar feelings of loss and alienation into something genuinely new.</comment>
