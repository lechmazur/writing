<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera is a strong archetype, but her defining attribute ("lethargically energetic") is more told than shown, and her motivation feels like an external thematic summary rather than a compelling internal drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is a clean, coherent vignette, but the central conflict's resolution is too neat. The unquestioning acceptance of her judgment feels slightly unearned in a world of desperate survivors, simplifying the potential for richer tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's superlative feature. The "acid rain forest" is not just a backdrop but a fully integrated, atmospheric element that justifies the characters' hardships and enriches the central symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly the central metaphor of the puzzle pieces. However, it commits a significant literary misstep by explicitly stating its theme ("the act of choosing still makes us human"), which patronizes the reader and flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise is commendably original and avoids most genre clich√©s. The prose is fresh and avoids formula. Its only weakness in this regard is the slightly programmatic "moral of the story" conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>An exceptionally cohesive and memorable piece where all elements serve the narrative. Its bid for the highest echelon is hindered only by a lack of ambiguity and a tendency to explain its own potent symbolism, holding the reader's hand too tightly.</comment>
