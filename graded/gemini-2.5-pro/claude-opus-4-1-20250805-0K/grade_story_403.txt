<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is conceptually strong, but she functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than as a unique, fully-realized individual with a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete and coherent, but its momentum relies on a convenient and somewhat arbitrary escape method (the notations), which slightly undermines the character's seven-year struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are exceptional and deeply integrated with the theme; the imagery of the library is fantastic, though the "fortune teller's booth" feels like a slightly discordant detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The piece has a powerful thematic impact and uses literary devices well, but it occasionally slips into 'telling' its message directly rather than 'showing' it through pure narrative inference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, brilliantly subverting common fantasy tropes. The prose feels authored and deliberate, showing no signs of formulaic writing or generic AI-like descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A conceptually brilliant and cohesive story that is a single revision away from excellence. Its primary flaw is a minor lack of subtlety in its thematic statements, holding it back from perfection.</comment>
