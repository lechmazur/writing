<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira is a well-realized archetype, a competent and empathetic vessel for the story's magic. Her motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. However, for the highest tier, her characterization lacks a potent internal conflict; she operates with a singular, unwavering purpose, which, while fitting, bypasses the opportunity for a more complex choice or visible internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot unfolds through a ritualistic process with its own consistent magical causality, building pressure toward a powerful climax. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration, where the spirits' state is decisively changed and Mira's Earned Stasis is reaffirmed with a felt, ongoing cost ("her inheritance").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary is an exceptional setting that transcends mere backdrop to become an active agent in the narrative. Its crystal walls and interaction with starlight are not only atmospheric but mechanically essential to the story's climax ("prisms began to hum... focusing into beams"). The setting directly enables and charges the final, resonant image of restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central spiritual stake—the peace of the drowned sailors—is established immediately and pursued with focus. The conflict builds through an accumulative pressure that deepens effectively, culminating in a release that feels earned by the protagonist's labor. The cost is clear, manifesting as the weight of Mira’s ongoing duty, which powerfully frames the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of memory, witness, and restoration is masterful, emerging organically from the story’s central conceit. The transformation of the net from an object of binding to one of mending is a powerful, embodied metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions without a whisper of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and sustained, establishing a mythic tone that perfectly suits the material. Point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that draws the reader into Mira's ritualistic state ("lucid unrest"). The prose carries a distinct and memorable perceptual signature, consistently filtering the world through Mira's unique craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery. Momentum is well-maintained, and the rhythm of the language supports the tone. A few phrases, such as the explanation of the "interlaced hush," lean slightly more toward direct authorial summary than embodied experience, a minor artifact in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story presents a fresh and compelling synthesis of maritime folklore and a unique, craft-based magic system. By focusing on restoration rather than confrontation, it subverts typical ghost story tropes. The concept of unraveling knots to release memories is a genuinely ingenious magical mechanic that feels both novel and archetypally resonant.</comment>
