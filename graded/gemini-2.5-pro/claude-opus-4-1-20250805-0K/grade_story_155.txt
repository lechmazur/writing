<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation is clear, but the pivotal turn from selfish desire to selfless duty feels abrupt and intellectually resolved rather than viscerally earned, a common concession to brevity that a top-tier piece would navigate with more nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively complete and coherent for its length, but the pacing of the resolution is compressed, making the climax and conclusion feel slightly rushed and overly tidy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally well-realized and integrated, creating a potent, unique atmosphere that is the story's greatest strength. The 'Celestial Wreck' is a memorable and thematically resonant invention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is rich with effective symbolism and a powerful central metaphor, but the explicit statement of the thematic choice ("wield catastrophic power or inherit... duty") verges on telling, slightly undermining the otherwise masterful craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates significant originality by combining disparate elements into a fresh, cohesive whole, successfully avoiding clich√© and the pitfalls of predictable prose. The voice is distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is a highly cohesive and imaginative work that uses its constraints to its advantage. While the swiftness of the protagonist's epiphany is a minor flaw, the overall execution is polished and impactful.</comment>
