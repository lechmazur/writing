<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's core motivation ("to feed curiosity...") is stated late and feels unearned, a moment of "telling" that undermines the otherwise consistent world-weary voice. The sister's motivation is clearer and more compelling than the protagonist's.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight, with a beginning, middle, and satisfying twist that re-contextualizes the entire narrative. The pacing is masterful for the word count, though the infiltration of the club relies on a slightly too-convenient plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, creating a potent, cohesive atmosphere. The fusion of decaying physical spaces with the concept of "digital ghosts" is evocative and immersive, enhanced by specific, memorable sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's craft is excellent, built on a foundation of strong, original metaphors ("social media exorcist," "digital ghosts"). The theme of choosing one's own "haunting" is sophisticated and the ending is both purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central conceit is highly original and refreshing. The prose is distinctive, avoiding clich√© for the most part, though the protagonist's stated motivation ("life's raw edge") verges on a familiar noir trope, slightly weakening an otherwise unique narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is a powerful, cohesive piece of flash fiction where the assigned elements feel integral, not forced. It succeeds in being a deliberate, impactful snapshot that leaves a lingering thematic question, though it is held back from perfection by a minor flaw in character motivation.</comment>
