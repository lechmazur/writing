<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character concept is strong, but the assigned attribute "rationally impulsive" is never convincingly demonstrated. His method is empathetic and methodical, not a paradoxical blend of logic and impulse, making this core trait feel unsupported and tacked on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot's resolution is its greatest weakness. A child surviving alone for months in a "hidden chamber" within a small, communal colony strains credulity. The discovery feels too convenient, sacrificing narrative logic for a tidy, sentimental ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the highlight. The concept of the Forbidden City as a vertical farm is imaginative and rendered with evocative details ("tomatoes grew through cracks in Ming dynasty murals"), creating a potent and memorable atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the prose has moments of quality, the final sentence explicitly states the story's theme. This is a cardinal sin of "telling, not showing" and fatally undermines any subtext or intellectual impact the story might have had, reducing it to a simplistic fable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, but the execution defaults to a predictable and overly sentimental trope. The "found child was safe and inspired by the hero all along" resolution feels emotionally safe and lacks the nuance and grit that the setting implies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>An excellent concept and setting are critically hobbled by an unbelievable plot and a heavy-handed, moralizing conclusion. The story feels like a promising but flawed draft, not a polished, publishable piece ready for a discerning audience.</comment>
