<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation and unique abilities are expertly woven into the narrative. However, the direct statement of her "joyfully melancholic" tone is a minor instance of telling over showing, a slight blemish on an otherwise nuanced portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and coherent, achieving a full emotional arc within the severe word constraint. The pacing is masterful, moving from physical setting to internal resolution with seamless logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are superlative. The setting is not mere backdrop but an active participant, with the salt corrosion directly enabling the protagonist's gift. Sensory details are specific, evocative, and deeply integrated with the story's emotional core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's craft is excellent, marked by powerful, multi-layered symbolism (the amber, the half-written letter). The central theme is profound and the ending is resonant. The use of the "thawing heart" metaphor, while effective, is a common literary device that slightly tempers its overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates high originality, subverting common tropes by using a ghost's story as a source of empowerment rather than horror. The prose is distinctive and the metaphors are fresh, showing no signs of formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is a model of cohesion, integrating its disparate elements so seamlessly they feel organically born from the narrative itself. It feels deliberate, profound, and leaves the reader with a lingering, philosophical thought, achieving a depth rarely seen in such a brief piece.</comment>
