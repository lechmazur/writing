<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The characters function as archetypes with overly expository dialogue that sacrifices subtlety and depth for plot advancement. Their motivations are clear but stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the story has a complete and coherent arc for its length, its central plot device—the 'meet-cute'—is a well-worn trope that makes the progression feel predictable, even with the self-aware nod.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength is its setting; the "reclaimed orchard" is a powerful, original, and symbolic environment that perfectly embodies the central theme of defiant nature amid human failure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by a pervasive tendency to 'tell' rather than 'show,' explicitly stating character roles, the meaning of symbols, and emotional states, stripping the narrative of potential subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The striking originality of the setting is severely counteracted by a reliance on formulaic character archetypes (guilty whistleblower, noble crusader) and a clichéd central plot device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its elements into a cohesive theme, but the seams show; several plot points, like the instantaneous handover of evidence, feel overly convenient and engineered rather than organic.</comment>
