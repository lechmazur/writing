<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Miran's motivation is clear and evolves convincingly from personal healing to communal salvation. Her core trait ("sturdy in the way of desert things") is well-articulated but demonstrated more through a single climactic choice than through a series of smaller, contradictory actions. The interiority relies on elegant summary ("salt and sorrow") rather than fully embodied, messy feeling, which slightly distances the reader from the "sandstorm" of her emotional climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural structure is expertly handled, building pressure through layered revelations until the final choice is inevitable. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with a clearly articulated cost ("her body heavy with purpose, carrying inside her the digested grief of ages"). The only minor flaw is the convenient discovery that the pool's spiral matches her grandmother's cookbook, a detail that confirms her destiny rather than complicating her choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's greatest strength, operating as both antagonist and crucible. The rain, the tidal pools, and the submerged pavilion are not mere backdrop; they are the active mechanism of the plot, constraining choice and charging the final, resonant image of the sorrow-free stars. Every descriptive detail, from the "geometric ridges" to the "frozen scream" of the coral, is purposeful and deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to absorb the fortress's trauma—is established early and intensifies effectively under an accumulative lens. The final choice is presented with clear agency and a visible, felt cost, which is excellent. However, framing the climax as "She had two choices" is slightly schematic, stating the binary conflict rather than letting it emerge entirely from the overwhelming pressure of the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of processing collective grief through individual sacrifice emerges organically and with significant power. The final image—the future feast that heals without explanation—is a sophisticated and resonant answer to the story's central question. A few lines, like the wind whispering "forgiveness," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the potent subtext carried by the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly controlled, and the narrative voice is a standout success—lyrical, confident, and perfectly suited to the story's mythic tone. Miran's perceptual signature, filtered through taste and memory, is consistently and effectively maintained, making the prose feel inseparable from the character. The rhythmic control and elevated diction are sustained without faltering, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The line-level craft is frequently beautiful, with evocative and precise figurative language. However, the story's momentum is hampered by a heavy reliance on exposition to establish the world's rules and history, exceeding the standard allowance for reflection. This front-loading of information, while clear, replaces the tension of discovery with summary, slightly dulling the propulsion toward the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the "tasting memories" trope exists, its synthesis with a desert setting built atop a sea of grief, and a chef as a psychic purifier, is highly original and compelling. The story fully commits to its unique premise, creating a memorable and coherent magical system. The resolution through absorption and transformation, rather than conflict, feels both fresh and thematically inevitable.</comment>
