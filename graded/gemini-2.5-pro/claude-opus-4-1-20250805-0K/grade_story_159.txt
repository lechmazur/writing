<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character concept is strong, but the stated motivation ("to puzzle out a labyrinth") is inconsistent with his actions (sharing a known solution). The "reality-rewriting betrayal" feels like an underdeveloped, high-concept crutch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with excellent pacing for its length, but it relies on a foundational magical premise that is asserted rather than earned, slightly undermining the narrative's internal coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The setting is deeply evocative and intrinsically linked to the plot and theme; the atmospheric details are specific, original, and create a powerful, memorable world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is superb, with rich, integrated symbolism. However, the impact is slightly blunted by the ending, which states its central theme too explicitly rather than allowing it to remain entirely as subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise is exceptionally original, successfully blending disparate concepts (mathematics, philosophy, weddings) into a fresh narrative. It avoids clich√©s and establishes a distinctive literary voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and artful story where all elements serve the central theme. While close to flawless, minor logical gaps and a slightly too-direct thematic statement prevent it from reaching the absolute highest tier.</comment>
