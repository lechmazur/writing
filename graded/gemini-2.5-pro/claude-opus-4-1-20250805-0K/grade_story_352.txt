<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is a compelling archetype, but "feral" feels more like an applied label than a deeply embodied trait; her actions read more as a graceful guardian than a truly wild being.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is a highly effective vignette, establishing a complete narrative cycle and existential conflict within a tight word count. The pacing is masterful for flash fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A significant strength; the world-building is exceptionally original, and the atmosphere is potent, specific, and immediately immersive. The setting and concept are flawlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is superb, with rich symbolism and a resonant central theme. However, the apprentice's dialogue ("Why bother?") serves as a slightly too-obvious device to state the theme outright.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and poignant piece where the constrained elements feel organic and essential. The brevity is a strength, creating a polished, gem-like story with a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
