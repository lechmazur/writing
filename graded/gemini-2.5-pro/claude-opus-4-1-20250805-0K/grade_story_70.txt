<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character arc for Marcus from "uptight scribe" to participant is clear and well-executed, but the transformation feels slightly too swift and frictionless to be entirely convincing for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, but the battery crafted from "cemetery copper and memory-moss extract" verges on a 'deus ex machina', resolving the central technological/magical conflict with an overly convenient invention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are the story's greatest strength. The central image of the greenhouse on the hill of gravestones is exceptionally potent and evocative, perfectly embodying the story's themes of life, death, and healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is strong, particularly the use of symbolism. However, the final paragraph states the theme ("some changes happen not in grand gestures...") too explicitly, slightly undermining the 'show, don't tell' principle upheld elsewhere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality by blending steampunk-adjacent technology with a unique, poignant system of magic. The core conceit of transforming grief through burned letters feels fresh and avoids genre clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The piece achieves a remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate assigned elements into a resonant and purposeful whole. It reads not as an exercise in fulfilling prompts, but as a deliberate and impactful piece of flash fiction.</comment>
