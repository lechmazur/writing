<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to integrate her fractured self is clear and compelling, driven by the pain of her condition. The internal conflict is well-externalized through the other Kiras and the shifting viaduct. The final choice feels earned, but the older Kira’s line, "Every choice murders infinite possibilities," while poignant, borders on being a thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned epiphany with a pre-packaged maxim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens flawlessly, with Kira's internal state causing external changes that escalate pressure. The structure is an elegant journey through possibility, not space, leading to a powerful on-page closure: a Decisive Change (pressing the rune) with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (integration). The cost—letting go of other lives—is conceptual but felt, landing with perfect clarity in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element. The procedurally generated viaduct is not a backdrop but a direct antagonist and mirror to the protagonist's psyche, actively constraining her path and reflecting her internal state. Its bioluminescence, shifting form, and eventual solidification perfectly charge the climax and final image, making the environment indispensable to the narrative's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving wholeness by integrating the self—is established immediately and consistently tested. Pressure escalates effectively as the viaduct's atmosphere darkens and the "might-have-beens" become threatening. The encounter with the older Kira provides a sharp, decisive tightening that forces the final, costly choice, making the resolution feel fully earned and impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of choice, identity, and the acceptance of limitation is explored with depth and nuance. The central metaphor of the viaduct and the final image of walking on solid ground provide a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is slightly capped by the older Kira's dialogue, which articulates the theme a little too explicitly, momentarily replacing subtext with thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice possesses a distinct, slightly mythic tone that suits the high-concept premise. The prose effectively conveys Kira's internal state through her perception of the world. A few phrases like "subconscious algorithms" and "procedural generation" feel slightly more explanatory than experiential, momentarily shifting the register away from the character's immediate sensory reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and clean, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The language effectively balances high-concept terminology with visceral description. Minor moments of near-redundancy slightly reduce momentum, such as describing the tablet as both "heavier than physics should allow" and having "impossible mass" in the same sentence, but these instances are infrequent and do not detract from the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>While "fractured timelines" is a familiar trope, the story transforms it with a highly original and integrated central metaphor: the viaduct as a procedural constructor of the self. The synthesis of psychological struggle with speculative physics feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its unique premise, resulting in a memorable and intellectually engaging piece.</comment>
