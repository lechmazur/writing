<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "minstrel" attribute feels underdeveloped and tacked-on, as the character's primary actions are mucking stables and contemplating; it doesn't meaningfully shape his personality or the narrative beyond a brief mention at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete and coherent arc within the word limit, but the resolution of a generations-long rivalry over a single cup of coffee feels too convenient and narratively neat, sacrificing believable conflict for thematic tidiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The worldbuilding is the story's greatest strength; the central image of rooftop horse stables against a futuristic cityscape is highly original, evocative, and perfectly encapsulates the "bizarrely typical" attribute.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with effective symbolism in the stamp, but the final sentence explicitly states the theme ("some inheritances exist only to be transformed"), a critical flaw that undermines the subtlety and trusts the reader too little.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise is highly original and avoids clich√©, successfully blending disparate genres. However, the fable-like structure and overly tidy emotional resolution feel somewhat formulaic in their execution, despite the fresh dressing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its assigned elements together seamlessly. Its primary weakness, preventing it from reaching the top echelon, is a tendency to favor thematic clarity over nuanced, complex resolution.</comment>
