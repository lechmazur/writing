<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central paradox of stage fright as a defense is clever, yet it teeters on convenience, slightly diminishing the very internal conflict it purports to establish. The character's core motivation is more impactful in its concrete form (grandmother's legacy) than in the abstract, overly literary phrasing used in the text.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete and well-paced, but the resolution feels like a logistical leap. The sudden introduction of ten thousand gallons of holy water is a deus ex machina that shifts the conflict from a nuanced psychological battle to a simplistic, brute-force conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The fusion of orbital decay with supernatural horror is fresh and evocative, creating a palpable sense of isolated dread. The sensory details of the corrupted factory are particularly vivid and unsettling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism is handled with intelligence, especially the wildflowers and the final image of a "garden blooming in reverse." However, the craft is weakened by moments of telling over showing, explicitly stating thematic developments ("fear turned inward, became armor") where subtext would have been more powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, successfully merging disparate genres. The prose is stylish but occasionally relies on the repetition of key thematic phrases, which gives it a slightly artificial, over-determined feel rather than the messy authenticity of a truly top-tier work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates immense conceptual tidiness; every element serves the whole. This near-perfect clockwork structure, however, sacrifices a measure of emotional grit. It reads more like a brilliant creative exercise than a raw, living narrative, feeling engineered rather than discovered.</comment>
