<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character serves the high-concept plot but lacks a distinct inner life beyond the assigned attributes; her emotional journey feels functional rather than deeply rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the narrative arc is complete, the plot is straightforward to the point of being frictionless, and the connection between the stated method (bats) and the primary action (music box) is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The world is built on evocative but abstract jargon; the connection between science and spirituality is asserted with a tidiness that undermines its potential profundity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story relies more on explicit thematic statements ("preserving humanity's last spiritual practices") and poetic assertions than on subtext, which lessens its potential resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story's originality lies in its novel combination of concepts, but the polished, frictionless prose and perfectly interlocking parts lend it a sterile, almost manufactured quality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is a feat of cohesive construction, but its conceptual perfection feels clinical; it impresses the mind more than it moves the soul, lacking the friction and nuance of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
