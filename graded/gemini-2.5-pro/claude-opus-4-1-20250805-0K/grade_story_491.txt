<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but she feels more like a symbolic vessel for the story's theme than a person with interiority. The "blood memory" justification for her patience is a narrative shortcut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and complete for the word count, with excellent pacing. Its central conceit of "destruction to create resurrection," while labeled "logically absurd," demands significant suspension of disbelief that isn't entirely earned by the narrative's internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The setting of a greenhouse for the dead is perfectly rendered with evocative sensory details, creating a powerful, melancholic mood that is inseparable from the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high caliber, distinguished by its potent use of metaphor and symbolism. The dialogue is sparse but carries immense thematic weight. The final image of resurrected "information" is both memorable and intellectually stimulating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's premise is highly original, successfully subverting the trope of the priceless artifact and the vandal. The prose is fresh and avoids clich√©, though the direct labeling of the scheme as "logically absurd" is a minor flaw, slightly weakening the otherwise confident narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in cohesion and thematic depth within the constraints of flash fiction. It feels deliberate and polished, leaving a profound, lingering question about the nature of preservation versus freedom. A near-flawless execution.</comment>
