<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character motivations are functional but thin. Marcus's "ache" for Vera feels more like a plot requirement than a deeply rendered emotion, and his "hollowness" is stated rather than convincingly shown. Vera exists more as a catalyst for the plot than as a developed character in her own right.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete for the word count, but it leans on the convenience of them meeting at the exact location of their first kiss. The central mechanism—the "data avalanche"—is a compelling concept, but its physical effect on Vera feels metaphorically vague rather than concretely established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The world-building is evocative and successfully establishes a grimy, melancholic cyberpunk atmosphere. However, the details, while well-executed, are standard genre fare (chemical runoff, bioluminescent graffiti) and do not push beyond established conventions to create a truly unique setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The craft shows ambition, particularly with its central metaphors. The major weakness is the dialogue, which serves as a heavy-handed thematic statement ("Destiny's just the agency's rambling...") rather than as natural speech, undermining the otherwise effective subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a competent synthesis of cyberpunk and spy-noir tropes but does not subvert or elevate them in a surprising way. The story feels more like a skillful execution of a familiar template than a piece with a unique authorial voice or a truly original perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its required elements, with the label, in particular, serving as an effective symbol. However, the overall impression is that of a piece that is slightly too neat and thematically tidy, held back from excellence by on-the-nose dialogue and a reliance on familiar genre beats.</comment>
