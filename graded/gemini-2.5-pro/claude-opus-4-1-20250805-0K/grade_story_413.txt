<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's arc is conceptually sound but emotionally abrupt, resolving through a neat aphorism rather than a developed internal shift. The "noble" attribute feels like superficial set dressing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A clear and elegant structure for its length, but its fable-like simplicity (invitation -> journey -> revelation) lacks the narrative complexity or surprise expected at this level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept of a pre-sentient, haunted corn maze is brilliantly original and evocative, a significant and memorable strength of the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and rich with impactful symbolism, but at times feels overly self-aware of its own cleverness, with dialogue that is too perfectly aphoristic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly original premise that avoids clich√© by treating a creation myth as an absurdist fable. Its primary strength is its unique conceptual blend.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is a cohesive and polished philosophical vignette, but its intellectual perfection comes at the cost of a certain raw, emotional depth, holding it just short of flawless.</comment>
