<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Professor Vega is compellingly drawn, her affliction a potent embodiment of the theme. Marcus, however, serves more as a functional-if-thin vessel for the plot; his naivete is a necessary key, but his internal world feels subordinate to the story's high concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight for its length, achieving a complete and satisfying arc. The pacing is relentless and effective. The final reveal, "The house docked your pain," while powerful, verges on over-explaining the metaphysical transaction, slightly diminishing the subtext.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of a high-tech tidal station with primal candlelit ritual is inspired and brilliantly executed. The atmosphere is the story's single greatest strength, creating a unique, tangible world where the fantastical premise feels entirely plausible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the use of symbolism (the mold, the tides) and the central chilling metaphor of the bargain. The story's impact is undeniable, but the final sentence ("...ledger of transformed souls") feels like an unnecessary summary of a theme that had already been powerfully demonstrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, and the prose is fresh and specific, avoiding clich√© and AI-like genericism. The narrative voice is distinct and confident. Its only trace of formula is its loose adherence to the "deal with the devil" archetype, albeit in a startlingly modern and inventive form.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive and resonant piece where all assigned elements are masterfully interwoven in service of a singular, haunting vision. The story's brevity feels intentional and impactful. It falls just shy of flawless due to a minor tendency to state its theme in the final paragraphs rather than trusting the reader entirely.</comment>
