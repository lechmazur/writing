<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist, Maya, functions more as a graceful conduit for the story's theme than a character with compelling internal conflict. Her "brazen calm" and pre-existing "ancestral knowledge" make her journey feel pre-determined and lacking in personal stakes or vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent, a complete arc in miniature. However, its neatness is also a weakness; the resolution, where Maya easily declines the 'invitation', feels overly convenient, sacrificing potential dramatic tension for a tidy thematic conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with the lighthouse setting being used to its full symbolic and moody potential. The blending of the haunted, ancient, and natural worlds is potent and immersive. The only slight weakness is a reliance on sound over other sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The craft is polished and the use of symbolism (the plastic whistle, the lighthouse as a bridge) is intelligent. However, the narrative voice lacks a unique, indelible signature; its high level of competence results in a story that feels more perfectly constructed than passionately inspired.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the story cleverly subverts the "haunted place" trope, its flawless structure and perfectly resolved emotional arc feel formulaic. The character's reasoning is too clean, lacking the nuanced messiness of human psychology, which gives the piece a slightly artificial, programmatic feel despite its fresh concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is a model of cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a seamless and thoughtful narrative. Its brevity feels deliberate and impactful. The main criticism is that it's almost *too* perfect, a self-contained literary object that lacks the raw edges or ambiguity that often define unforgettable fiction.</comment>
