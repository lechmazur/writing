<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a symbolic vessel than a person with discernible inner conflict; her motivation is functional but lacks personal, specific depth that would elevate her beyond a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is a clean, linear progression without significant obstacles or reversals, which lessens narrative tension and makes the resolution feel preordained and emotionally weightless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The integration of the desolate setting, the storm, and the story's core concept is nearly flawless, creating a deeply immersive and thematically resonant atmosphere that is the piece's greatest strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery is undermined by an overly explicit thematic statement at the end, which reduces subtext and feels like a lecture to the reader rather than a discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the core concept of architectural acoustics as a key is fresh, the narrative relies on the familiar trope of a perceived limitation being a secret strength, following a somewhat predictable and frictionless path.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The piece is a highly cohesive and beautifully rendered vignette, but its lack of meaningful conflict or character-driven struggle makes it feel more like an elegant proof-of-concept than a compelling narrative ready for publication.</comment>
