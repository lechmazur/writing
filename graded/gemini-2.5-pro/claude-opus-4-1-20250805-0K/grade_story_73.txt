<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miguel is well-realized as "steady," but his "diligently whimsical" nature feels like backstory rather than an active trait in the core scene. Elena is far too passive; her motivation is reported secondhand via her grandmother, and she functions more as a vessel for exposition than a character with agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete and satisfying arc within the word count, which is commendable. However, the core action of their work—"opening doorways" and "planting crosses"—is summarized rather than dramatized, a narrative shortcut that lessens the impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fusion of the setting (Aztec temple/cemetery) with the core concept is the story's superlative feature. The atmosphere is thick, specific, and powerfully evocative, using precise sensory details to create a tangible sense of liminality. This aspect is flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and the imagery strong, but the story is critically weakened by expository dialogue. Lines like "Every generation, one gravedigger sees..." serve as an elegant info-dump, telling the reader the rules of the world instead of showing them through more subtle means. This is a significant craft issue for a top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the specific cultural details and poetic language are fresh, the underlying framework—an elder mentor identifying a young, uniquely gifted successor to carry on a hidden magical tradition—is a very common fantasy trope. The story executes the trope beautifully but does not subvert or innovate upon it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is a strong, cohesive whole with a truly exceptional atmosphere. However, its reliance on a well-worn narrative trope and expository dialogue to convey its rules prevents it from achieving the standard of flawless. It feels like a brilliant draft that needs one more revision to sharpen the character dynamics and subtext.</comment>
