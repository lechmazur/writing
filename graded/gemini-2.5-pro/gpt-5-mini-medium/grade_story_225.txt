<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent, but he is more of a static archetype of the romantic obsessive than a developing personality. His portrayal is beautiful but lacks an internal arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced until the final sentence. The resolution ("Months later the cartographer returned...") is a narrative summary that feels abrupt and tells rather than shows the reunion, slightly undermining the carefully built tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a steampunk setting with naturalistic observation is masterful. The atmosphere is thick with specific, evocative sensory details ("salt and radiator soot," "oil and lavender") that perfectly support the story's melancholy and wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's central metaphor—love as a signal broadcast through butterfly migration—is sophisticated and sustained with immense craft. The language is poetic and precise, creating significant emotional impact and rich subtextual layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates exceptional originality. The synthesis of disparate genres and ideas feels entirely fresh, and the prose has a distinct, literary voice that avoids cliché and generic description. The character's reasoning is poetically, not robotically, logical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is a powerful, cohesive vignette where all assigned elements are woven together in service of a singular, memorable vision. It feels like a deliberate and masterfully executed piece of flash fiction, marred only by a slightly too-convenient final resolution.</comment>
