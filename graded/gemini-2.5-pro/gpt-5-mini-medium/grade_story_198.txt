<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character is a strong archetype for the narrative's purpose and her motivation is crystal clear, but she lacks a defining individualizing trait beyond her immediate, plot-driven function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a standout strength, using specific sensory details and the unique setting to create a tangible, evocative world that flawlessly supports the narrative's tone and concept.</comment>
