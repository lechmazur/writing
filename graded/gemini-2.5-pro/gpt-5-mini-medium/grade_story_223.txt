<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's core affliction (seasickness) and motivation are brilliantly linked to the story's resolution. However, the 'naval officer' persona feels like background dressing rather than a fully integrated aspect of his present self beyond the nausea.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is remarkably complete and coherent within the word count. Cause and effect are clear. The 'tracking moon phases' method feels slightly less developed than other plot elements, functioning more as a timer than a deep part of the process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength. The synthesis of the crystal fortress, the mirror's properties, and the magical bulb creates a potent, evocative atmosphere that is perfectly aligned with the story's themes of memory and truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates masterful craft through its lyrical prose and powerful symbolism. The ending, where a profound internal change is shown via a subtle physical release (the easing of seasickness), is both satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is highly original, combining disparate fantasy elements into a unique and memorable whole. The prose is stylish and avoids clich√©, though the deliberate repetition of key phrases, while thematic, slightly risks feeling like a stylistic tic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a rare level of cohesion, with all assigned elements feeling purposeful and deeply interwoven. The narrative is dense and literary, using its constrained length to create a potent, vignette-like emotional impact that lingers.</comment>
