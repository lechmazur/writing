<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While the combination of elements is fresh, the intensely lyrical, metaphor-heavy style feels like a familiar, if well-executed, mode of "literary" writing rather than a groundbreaking authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elements are woven together with impressive intellectual cohesion, but the story feels more like a high-level creative exercise than a narrative with undeniable emotional urgency.</comment>
