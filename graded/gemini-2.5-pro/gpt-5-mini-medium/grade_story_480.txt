<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The character is a powerful, well-realized archetype, defined more by his unique function and philosophy than by traditional psychological depth. This enigmatic quality is a deliberate and effective choice that serves the story's conceptual focus perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The plot is a tight, circular vignette. Its use of refrain-like repetition of key phrases provides a poetic structure that reinforces the character's ritualistic process, achieving a remarkable sense of completeness within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph. It masterfully blends a gritty, urban-decay noir aesthetic with the abstract melancholy of the digital age, creating a cohesive and deeply evocative world for its unique protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, driven by a series of brilliant, resonant metaphors ("comments like bones," "cartographer of edges") that elevate a simple plot into a profound commentary on modern connection. The story successfully 'shows' through its dense, purposeful prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates supreme originality. The core conceit of a "social media exorcist" is a fresh, intelligent subversion of a known trope, and it is executed with a unique authorial voice entirely free of clich√© or formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>This is a rare example of a story where the constraints of assigned elements have forged a piece that is stronger and more cohesive *because* of them. It's a conceptually dense, stylistically confident piece that is immediately publishable.</comment>
