<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's core traits are asserted more than they are demonstrated; while the motivation is clear, the "fanatical" and "optimistically bitter" aspects are stated directly rather than being fully woven into the fabric of his actions, leaving his psychology slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
