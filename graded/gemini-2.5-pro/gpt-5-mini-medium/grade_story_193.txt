<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters serve as effective symbolic archetypes, but lack deep individual voice or agency; the "unintentionally iconic" attribute is a poetic flourish that has minimal impact on character action or development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively complete for the word count, but the resolution relies on explicitly stating the theme in the final sentence, a significant weakness that undermines the preceding subtlety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is potent and the sensory details are evocative, masterfully connecting the setting to the theme of liminality, though it borders on being slightly contrived in its symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is rich with fresh, effective imagery, but its impact is significantly blunted by the final sentence, which "tells" the theme that the rest of the story successfully "shows."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the lyrical style is distinctive, the story is built upon the familiar trope of a protagonist being healed by a mysterious stranger's arrival, avoiding clich√© through execution rather than a wholly original concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story is a strong example of weaving symbolic elements into a cohesive whole, but it is held back from excellence by a failure of nerve in the final moments, choosing to state its message instead of trusting the reader.</comment>
