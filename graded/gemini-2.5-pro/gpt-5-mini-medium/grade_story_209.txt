<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is poignantly established through the promise to the dying woman, but the "seasoned woodsman" archetype feels slightly mismatched with his highly technical, almost acoustical engineering-based methodology. The story doesn't leverage specific woodcraft skills, making the label feel more like flavor than a functional aspect of his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure is remarkably tight and complete for the word count, using the hospital beep as an effective framing device. The plot progresses logically, however, the climactic breakthrough linking an emotional confession to a physical discovery ("a reroute that freed the path forward") verges on magical realism, slightly straining the story's established quasi-scientific grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's crowning achievement. The "radio wave garden" is a brilliantly original and evocative concept that perfectly marries the technological and the spectral. The fusion of decaying industrial sites with the hum of scavenged electronics creates a powerful, unique mood that deeply supports the themes of memory and hidden history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally high, with rich, layered metaphors ("barber of lost schedules," "brittle coins"). The central theme of honesty as a tool for mapping both land and soul is powerful. However, the prose is so consistently dense with figurative language that it occasionally feels overwrought, risking stylistic fatigue and slightly obscuring the narrative under its own weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original in its premise and combination of elements. The metaphors are fresh and specific. The primary weakness is a subtle structural repetition; the action "short-circuit" is applied almost identically as a metaphor for both technical failure and emotional breakthrough, which feels a little too tidy and lessens the impact of the second usage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive and resonant piece that successfully integrates its disparate elements into a singular artistic vision. It feels deliberate and deep, leaving a lasting impression. The only significant point of friction is the slight dissonance between the "woodsman" character and his specific actions, and a stylistic density that borders on excessive, which could be refined for greater clarity and impact.</comment>
