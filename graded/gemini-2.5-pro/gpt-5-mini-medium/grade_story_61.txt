<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively contained and the climax is effective, but the connection between the queen's ritual and the city's 'new invention' remains thematically present but causally vague.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A highly cohesive and imaginative piece, but the focus on intricate world-building and magical mechanics comes at the expense of deeper character resonance, holding it back from true excellence.</comment>
