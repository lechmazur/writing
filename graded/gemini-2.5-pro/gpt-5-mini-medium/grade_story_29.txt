<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by directly stated attributes ("cleverly naive") rather than demonstrated nuance, feeling more like a symbolic archetype than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete and coherent, but the central conflict is resolved with such ease and swiftness that it lacks meaningful tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength, with potent, specific sensory details ("crushed quince and static") effectively creating a memorable, liminal world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the prose is ambitious and imagistic, it verges on being overwrought; its craft feels self-conscious, drawing attention to the writing itself rather than seamlessly serving the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative feels engineered; explicitly stating the assigned tone ("agonizing bliss") and attribute ("cleverly naive") breaks verisimilitude and suggests formula over organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its disparate elements into a thematically resonant whole, but its polish feels constructed, lacking the authentic grit of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
