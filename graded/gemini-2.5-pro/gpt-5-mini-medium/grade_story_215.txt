<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's internal state ("rattled," "inwardly social") is expertly drawn and consistent, but the "exorcist" profession feels like a superficial label. It provides a source for his unease but is not meaningfully integrated or explored beyond that, slightly weakening an otherwise strong portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent, executing a complete and satisfying arc within the word count. The progression from postcard to puzzle to resolution is logical and brisk, driven effectively by the core action of synthesis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength. The juxtaposition of the sterile psychic facility with the kinetic, artistic energy of the adjacent dance lessons is not just a backdrop but a central, resonant metaphor that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The level of craft is outstanding. The prose is dense with fresh, purposeful imagery ("fossilized confessions," "sly, aggressive calm"), and the central theme of uniting rigor and wonder is explored with significant subtext, culminating in a powerful, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality, primarily by recontextualizing a familiar "hidden room" trope within a unique thematic framework. The prose has a distinct literary voice, and the nuanced weaving of disparate elements like psychic research and dance feels entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in cohesion. It uses its many assigned elements not as a checklist but as integral, interlocking parts of a unified whole. The piece feels deliberate and artistically complete, leaving a lingering and thought-provoking final impression.</comment>
