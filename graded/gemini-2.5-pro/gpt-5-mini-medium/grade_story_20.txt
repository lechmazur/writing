<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's core identity as a "disappointed archer" feels more like a poetic conceit than a fully integrated trait, serving as metaphor rather than influencing action beyond a mention of "steady aim."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal setting of the inverted waterfall and the cosmic timeframe are masterfully interwoven, creating a unique, magical-realist atmosphere that perfectly externalizes the character's internal, philosophical reckoning.</comment>
