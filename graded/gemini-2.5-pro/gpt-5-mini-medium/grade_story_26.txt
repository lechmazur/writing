<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, but the character himself feels more like an archetypal vessel for the story's potent ideas than a person with granular, surprising details. The "singularly plural" attribute is stated more than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is conceptually abstract but structurally flawless for its length. The circular narrative, framed by the radio broadcast, provides a powerful sense of completeness and coherence. Cause and effect, though esoteric, are logically consistent within the world's rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of world and atmosphere is the story's most significant achievement. The "neon orchard" is a masterful, evocative image, and the cyberpunk underworld is rendered with dense, sensory details that feel both grimy and beautiful, perfectly supporting the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The literary craft is ambitious and largely successful, employing a rich tapestry of metaphor and symbolism. The central theme of shame's transformation is handled with profound nuance. The prose, however, occasionally verges on being overwrought, risking its impact by becoming stylistically too dense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original piece. It skillfully repurposes cyberpunk tropes for a poetic, psychological purpose, avoiding genre cliché. The central conceit—translating DNA into a sound that fractures shame—is fresh, and the nuanced ending demonstrates sophisticated, non-formulaic thinking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An outstanding work of flash fiction that successfully integrates its many assigned components into a cohesive, resonant whole. It operates on a high conceptual and stylistic level, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impression. Its brevity feels purposeful, not restrictive.</comment>
