<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character is more a symbolic function than a developed entity. We are told its attributes ("aggressively kind," "mariner's grin") rather than seeing them revealed through nuanced action. The "unseen" nature is an interesting constraint, but the result is an abstract vessel for the theme, lacking a distinct, believable voice or interiority beyond its stated purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear symbolic arc, but its internal logic is tenuous. The magical causality linking a dancer's step, a whale's call, and a lighthouse ritual feels asserted rather than earned, relying on the reader's unquestioning acceptance of a connection that is never grounded. The narrative feels more like a static tableau than a dynamic progression of events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's most successful feature. The "haunted lighthouse watch room" is rendered with evocative, sensory detail, and the transition from haunted-by-ghosts to haunted-by-memory is potent. This is a significant strength. However, the connection to the "theater backshore" is purely conceptual and weakens the coherence of the world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious, with dense, lyrical prose and strong central symbolism. However, the story frequently undermines itself by over-explaining its own metaphors ("a ridiculous talisman meant to redirect hearing"). It tells the reader its themes and intentions directly, sacrificing subtext for explicit statement, which is a mark against it at a high literary level. The central conflict is abstract and lacks visceral tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The writing exhibits signs of sophisticated formula. Key phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom," "brazen calm") are repeated verbatim, a common AI trait that a human author would vary. The prose, while ornate, has a sterile quality, and the emotional landscape is described rather than evoked. The narrative feels reverse-engineered from its components, a technically impressive but ultimately soulless construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story demonstrates impressive technical skill in weaving its assigned elements into a cohesive whole, it reads like a brilliant exercise rather than a living piece of fiction. The style is so self-consciously "literary" that it creates a barrier to emotional engagement. The piece feels constructed to be admired for its cleverness, but it lacks the human spark and nuance required for top-tier publication.</comment>
