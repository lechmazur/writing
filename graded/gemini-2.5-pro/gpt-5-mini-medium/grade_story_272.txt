<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is more a vessel for a series of well-turned metaphors than a person. His defining traits are stated and allegorized ("tree of regret") rather than revealed through subtler action or genuine psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is a coherent and well-paced internal arc, but it lacks any real external stakes or dynamism. The story ends precisely where the more compelling narrative—the execution of his plan—would begin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane, physical diner with the abstract, digital archive is the story's strongest atmospheric element, creating a potent sense of grounded isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The craft is undeniable but suffocating. The prose is so saturated with relentless, heavy-handed metaphors ("axe of decisions," "wallet of shame," "sap-sucking habits") that it becomes overwrought, drawing more attention to its own cleverness than the story's emotional core.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the combination of elements feels fresh, the story relies on a repetitive and predictable metaphorical structure (abstract emotion = rustic/physical object), which feels like a stylistic formula rather than organic invention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is impressively cohesive and all elements are tightly integrated. However, its style is so dominant and self-conscious that it feels less like a narrative and more like an exercise in applying a consistent metaphorical theme. The craft overwhelms the content.</comment>
