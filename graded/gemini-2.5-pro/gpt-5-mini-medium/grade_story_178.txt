<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's core trait (a clerk's patience and meticulousness) is exceptionally well-integrated into the plot's resolution method, but the character himself remains a somewhat archetypal "quiet hero" without deeper, individuating flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete and coherent arc within the word count, but the central plot turn relies on a slightly too-convenient encounter with a mentor figure (the geneticist) who provides the key hypothesis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of the mundane office and the fantastical undersea greenhouse is seamless and masterful. The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with specific, evocative sensory details creating a wholly original and immersive world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, driven by powerful, sustained metaphors (stamps as codices, coral as synapses). The ending is purposeful and earned, avoiding a simplistic resolution and leaving a lingering sense of profound, ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is highly original, successfully fusing disparate concepts (bureaucracy, philately, quantum mechanics, marine biology) into a unique and memorable narrative. The metaphors are consistently fresh and specific, avoiding clich√© and formulaic expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates extraordinary cohesiveness, weaving its many required elements into a singular, resonant narrative. The density of the prose and the ambition of the concept feel deliberate and expertly controlled, resulting in a work of significant depth and literary merit.</comment>
