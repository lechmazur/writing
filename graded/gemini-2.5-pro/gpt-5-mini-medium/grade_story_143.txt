<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's assigned traits ("fidgety," "musically untalented") are integrated with exceptional skill, but the stated motivation ("to hold chaos at bay") feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of the rest of the execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's triumph; the central contrast between the lavender field and the factory ruins provides a powerful, consistent, and evocative aesthetic that fuels the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The level of prose craft is exceptionally high, deploying fresh, memorable imagery ("green tooth split through ash," "feral metal") and a resonant final line that elevates the entire piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The piece shows masterful cohesion, weaving its many constraints into a seamless whole. It feels less like an exercise and more like a deliberate, polished work of art that lingers long after reading.</comment>
