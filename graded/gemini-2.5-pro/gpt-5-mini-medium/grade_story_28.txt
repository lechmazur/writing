<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is clear and his methods are well-established, but the core descriptor “sly” feels unearned. His actions demonstrate diligence and sensitivity, not cunning or subterfuge, creating a dissonance between the label and the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a strong sense of completeness and coherence for its length, effectively using the conceptual timeframe to create a climax. The plot is more a vignette than a traditional arc, but it is focused and well-paced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength.

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is remarkably cohesive, weaving its disparate elements into a thematically resonant whole. It feels purposeful and leaves a lingering impression, though its literary aspirations are so pronounced that they occasionally detract from a purely immersive experience.</comment>
