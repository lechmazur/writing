<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character arc is clear, but the "knight" persona feels slightly affected and is stated too bluntly at the outset rather than shown, creating a minor conceptual hurdle in an otherwise strong portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story presents a complete and satisfying emotional arc, but its structure is more of a vignette than a plot; the conflict is entirely internal, lacking a strong external driver which can reduce narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully rendered through the contrast between the cold agency and the warm remedies, but the physical reality of the central "altars" remains a bit too abstract to be fully grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with excellent use of metaphor and symbolism, but the prose occasionally feels self-consciously literary, with certain phrases ("compose a single, stubborn symphony") bordering on being overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise—a secret agent delivering folk remedies—is exceptionally original and memorable, successfully avoiding genre clichés and forging a unique narrative space, which is its greatest strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's major achievement is its remarkable cohesion, weaving a disparate collection of high-concept elements into a moving and thought-provoking whole that feels deliberate and artistically complete.</comment>
