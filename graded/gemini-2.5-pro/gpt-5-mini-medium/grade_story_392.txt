<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character is a compelling archetype whose motivation is clear, but she remains a static figureâ€”a vessel for the story's theme rather than a fully developed individual. She lacks a dynamic internal arc or meaningful change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The piece excels as a vignette but lacks a discernible plot structure. It describes a static situation and a meticulous process rather than narrating an event with a clear arc, resulting in minimal narrative tension or progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is potent, built on an effective contrast between the sterile digital archive and the character's tactile methods. The world feels immersive, though a minor detail like "braille lamps" feels more aesthetically chosen than logically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is stylistically ambitious and memorable, but its self-conscious density and insistence on explaining its own central metaphor ("literally figurative") slightly undermine its impact, bordering on the overwritten.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally original, weaving high-concept and melancholic elements into a unique whole. The perspective is distinct, and the combination of speculative fiction with mundane, poetic detail feels entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A cohesive and intellectually stimulating piece that is hindered by a static plot. While the assigned elements are masterfully integrated, the narrative feels more like an elegant, beautiful thought experiment than a compelling story.</comment>
