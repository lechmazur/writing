<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character serves the plot capably, but her defining traits ("jumpy," "necromancer") feel more like stylish labels than deeply integrated aspects of her personality; the connection between necromancy and paint analysis, while creative, feels slightly post-hoc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally well-structured, particularly in its use of the "echoing footsteps" to meter tension, but the final resolution into unanimous applause feels overly neat, slightly diminishing the complexity of the cultural shift the story otherwise handles so well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly imagined and brimming with unique details that serve the narrative, but the central object—the fishhook—feels thematically and aesthetically disconnected from the retro video game setting, an arbitrary choice in an otherwise cohesive environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is built on a foundation of potent imagery and subtext, but its impact is slightly blunted by the final sentence, which explicitly summarizes the theme ("rerouted worship into critique") rather than trusting the reader to grasp the implications of the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story's central conceit—forensic necromancy in a digital world—is brilliantly original, but the ultimate thematic resolution, while well-executed, rests on the familiar idea that truth is more complex than myth, subverting a common trope without forging entirely new thematic ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a tight, imaginative narrative; however, minor flaws like a functional-but-thin protagonist and a slightly too-tidy resolution prevent it from achieving the flawless execution required for the highest tier.</comment>
