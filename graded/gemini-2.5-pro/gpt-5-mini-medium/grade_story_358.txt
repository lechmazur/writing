<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character is well-conceived, but his internal state is more described by the narrator than organically revealed. The emotional shifts feel intellectually justified ("claiming frontiers does not permit indulgence") rather than fully inhabited, keeping the character at a slight remove.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story executes a complete and compelling arc within the word limit. The mechanism for solving the riddle, while abstract, serves as a potent and coherent engine for the plot, driving the narrative to its chilling conclusion with excellent pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The fusion of the arctic setting, the greenhouse, and the ancient Egyptian object is a masterstroke. The atmosphere of "sanctified dread" is tangible and perfectly supported by rich sensory details, making the world the story's most successful element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is superb, with fresh metaphors and a powerful central theme about the cost of knowledge. However, the prose, while ambitious, occasionally becomes self-consciously literary ("a small geography of meaning"), which can momentarily detract from the narrative's immersive power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, avoiding genre clich√©s. The execution is strong, but the repetition of the key phrase "the unfolding riddle" and a slight tendency to narrate the character's psychology feel like authorial tics that could be refined for a more seamless, authentic feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A remarkably cohesive and impactful story that weaves its disparate elements into a powerful whole. It is held back from true flawlessness only by minor instances of intellectualized prose and repetition that betray the author's hand, but it is nonetheless an impressive piece of fiction.</comment>
