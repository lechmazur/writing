<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character is consistent and his "sincere" nature shapes his gentle methodology, but the "necromancer" attribute feels more like an aesthetic label than a functional aspect of his identity. His powers or specific knowledge are only vaguely gestured at ("gentle with bones"), leaving the most unique part of his character profile under-leveraged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story presents a complete and coherent, if slight, internal arc. The plot, driven by a philosophical quest, is well-paced for the word count. However, the stakes are entirely cerebral and the resolution is an epiphany, which, while elegant, lacks a degree of narrative dynamism or external consequence that would elevate it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the contemplative foreground and the "playground sounds" of the background is masterful. However, the "goblin city" setting itself is underdeveloped. Beyond the sounds, it remains a generic underground space, missing an opportunity to more deeply integrate a unique culture into the necromancer's work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally strong, weaving symbolism (pen, tapestry) and theme into a cohesive whole. The central idea—that understanding is a method of listening, not a final answer—is beautifully rendered. The prose occasionally verges on the overwrought ("hummed at the marrow of things"), slightly marring an otherwise powerful and resonant piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, subverting the necromancer trope and creating a fresh narrative space. The prose is distinctive and avoids AI-like patterns or clichés. The primary weakness is a tendency toward a self-conscious poeticism that feels slightly less than authentic in a few key phrases, a minor but noticeable affectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in cohesion, integrating its disparate elements into a singular, memorable mood piece. It feels deliberate and artful in its brevity. Its main limitation is that it remains a beautiful, static portrait; the philosophical weight overshadows narrative tension, making it feel more like an elegant fable than a fully realized story.</comment>
