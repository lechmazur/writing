<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a thematic vessel than a developed individual. His motivation is clear but is stated with a blunt repetition that substitutes for nuanced revelation, making him feel more like a program executing a function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story follows a complete and coherent arc, but the plot's resolution—the storm simply recoiling—is a moment of convenient magical thinking that lacks dramatic credibility, even for a speculative piece. It resolves the conflict too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's primary strength is its atmosphere, which is dense, evocative, and masterfully realized. The fusion of high-tech and ancient ritual in the sky burial setting is powerful and immersive, a truly standout element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by a lack of subtlety. The theme is stated and restated explicitly, demonstrating a distrust of the reader. The prose, while lyrical, frequently becomes overwrought, sacrificing narrative impact for stylistic flourish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, but the execution leans on repetitive phrasing and a predictable "literary" style. The constant repetition of key ideas feels like a formulaic tic rather than a deliberate, effective liturgical choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A stylish piece with a brilliant concept that is ultimately a promising failure. It is cohesive but overwrought, mistaking dense prose and explicit theme statements for profundity. It's a strong draft that requires a severe edit to be considered for publication.</comment>
