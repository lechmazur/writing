<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character functions as a symbolic vessel for the theme but lacks personal depth; the "knight" designation feels arbitrary and unexplored, weakening the foundation of his motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is a coherent and complete metaphorical arc, but its conflict is so abstract—with consequences only alluded to—that it lacks visceral stakes and emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fusion of setting, tone, and conceptual frame is masterful, creating a potent and deeply immersive atmosphere that is the story's most significant achievement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious but self-conscious, and the heavy-handed repetition of key phrases ("grudgingly sweet") undermines the otherwise effective symbolism, drawing too much attention to the writing itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the conceptual blend is original, the execution feels overly constructed; the rhythmic repetition of phrases and the neat symbolic resolution suggest a formula rather than an organic narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates immense technical skill in its cohesion, but its polish comes at the cost of vitality; it reads like a flawless but cold exercise in literary craft, narrowly missing the mark for publication.</comment>
