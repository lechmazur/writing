<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character traits (ambivalent, bashful arrogance, happily sad) are repeatedly stated but not convincingly demonstrated through action or nuanced internal thought; motivation feels abstract and disconnected from the chosen method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot attempts an arc (quest initiated, pursued, seemingly resolved but ongoing), but coherence suffers significantly due to the bizarre and poorly justified method (jigsaw edges); the connection between action and method feels arbitrary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The lunar setting provides some atmosphere, but its connection to the core action, method, and object feels superficial; the 'between heartbeats' timeframe is used inconsistently, more as a recurring phrase than a meaningful constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on telling abstract states ("happily sad certainty," "bashful arrogance") rather than showing; excessive repetition of key phrases ("defragment," "between heartbeats," "final oath") undermines impact; lacks genuine emotional resonance or subtextual depth despite attempts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The prose is overwrought and repetitive ("defragment," "cracked," "happily sad," "bashful arrogance," "between heartbeats"), suggesting formulaic construction; metaphors feel forced rather than organic; lacks nuanced emotion and individual style, bordering on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story struggles significantly with cohesion; the disparate elements feel awkwardly stitched together rather than integrated, hindering clarity and overall impact. The narrative feels burdened by fulfilling element requirements.</comment>
