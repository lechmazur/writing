<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Miren’s internal conflict is expertly rendered through concrete action, particularly the ritual of shedding her professional insignia. The motivation is clear and the arc from fragile conviction to humble doubt is earned. The score is held back slightly by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as stating her motivation "was to balance self-reckoning and compassion," which veers close to diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story follows a strong causal chain within a single, continuous scene, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, a significant and unresolvable continuity error severely damages the climactic beat: the text states Miren lines up five corpses but then gathers six tail fragments for her plaque of six vows. This mathematical impossibility at the story's symbolic apex breaks causality and would require mandatory revision before publication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The misty workshop is an exceptional micro-setting, functioning as both crucible and sanctuary. Every element—the cedar table, the iron stove, the refrigerated drawer—is integrated purposefully into Miren's ritual of reconstruction. The atmosphere of "shimmering stillness" perfectly mirrors her internal state and charges the final image, easily satisfying the 9+ gate by having the environment constrain and shape the core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story masterfully handles a purely internal conflict, with the dominant stake being Miren’s professional soul. The pressure deepens decisively when she retrieves the bodies, a turn driven entirely by her agency. The cost of her transformation—a permanent forfeiture of pride for a richer, more honest doubt—is made tangible and legible in the final plaque and her release of the last chameleon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the central metaphor of shedding layers to reconstruct an identity. The final image of the plaque and the freed chameleon provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about integrity. The score is capped just below 9.0 due to a few lines that state the theme too directly, like "reconstruction begins with visibility," slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is the story's greatest strength: lyrical, precise, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Miren's profession. Psychic distance is managed perfectly, drawing the reader into her somber reckoning without a single slip. The prose has a rhythmic quality that modulates with the story's emotional pressure, creating a narrative that is both elegant and deeply felt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and resonant figurative language ("vertebrae of a promise"). The prose is clean and propulsive. The score is lowered due to the critical factual error originating at the line level—the contradiction between "five small bodies" and "six ivory fragments"—which introduces a logical flaw that propagates up to the plot level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the theme of professional reckoning is familiar, its execution is highly original. The specific premise of the poisoned chameleon feed is fresh, and the central ritual of creating a memorial plaque from the victims' remains is a unique and hauntingly inventive representation of atonement. This synthesis of a universal emotional arc with such particular, memorable details feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
