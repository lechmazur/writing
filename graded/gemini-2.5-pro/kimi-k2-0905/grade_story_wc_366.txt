<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The characterization of Elias is deep and specific, with his motivations shown through resonant, character-particular actions like building the cairn of apologies. His internal conflict—fear for the keeper versus faith in their ritual—is palpable and drives the narrative. The final action is slightly undermined by a continuity issue with the sea glass, which prevents a perfect score, but the core of the character remains compellingly drawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story follows an elegant Accumulative/Textural structure until the final paragraph, where a significant continuity error occurs. Elias is described as leaving the sea glass for the keeper, but then produces it from his flask on the boat, breaking causality and muddling the closure. This flaw directly damages the final resonant image, a critical failure in an otherwise well-structured piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptional, with the tower and its lantern room rendered as a living, breathing entity that constrains the emotional core of the story. Sensory details are specific, purposeful, and filtered beautifully through the POV ("shadows pooled where light once conspired with the sea"). The micro-setting of the stacked stones is indispensable, charging the central conflict and the story's final moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the silent connection with the keeper is broken—is established early and powerfully. Pressure deepens effectively when the lamp dies early, sharpening Elias’s fear. His agency is clear in his choice to continue their ritual, and the keeper's response provides a resolution, even if the final image is compromised by the continuity flaw noted in Q2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of witnessing, memory, and connection in isolation are handled with masterful subtlety, primarily through the subtext of the stone-and-glass language. The story avoids any overt moralizing. However, the thematic resonance of the final image is significantly weakened by the plot contradiction, which introduces confusion where there should be a complex, resonant ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the reticent protagonist. The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and possesses a strong perceptual signature ("the horizon felt stitched with black wire"). The prose has a deliberate, melancholic rhythm that perfectly embodies the story's tone and enhances its emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is of a publishable, literary quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and rhythmic precision. Sentences like "The sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" are ambitious and effective within the established voice. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, but the overall craft is capped by the structural flaw it is used to describe.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core premise of an "anonymous letter chain" conducted through found objects is highly original and transforms the familiar trope of the lonely lighthouse keeper. The story's emotional truth feels specific and deeply earned, avoiding sentimentality. The execution is ingenious, creating a powerful narrative from silence and gesture, though its full potential is unrealized due to the flawed ending.</comment>
