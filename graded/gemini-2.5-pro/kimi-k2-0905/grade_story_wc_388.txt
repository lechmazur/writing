<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marisol’s motivation is established with compelling backstory and immediately tested. The internal conflict lands powerfully when the diamond forces her to confront her own complicity, making her subsequent choice to broadcast the truth—rather than hide or destroy it—a perfectly earned and character-defining act. The line "excavate truth from comfortable lies, even if the shovel cut her own hands" is expertly dramatized by the story's end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates flawless structural integrity under a Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens. The plot unfolds through a clear and compelling chain of discovery, while the ending delivers a superb Conceptual Repricing. The final image of truth accelerating rot provides an on-page cost that is both unexpected and thematically resonant, making the before/after state of the world palpable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's standout feature, a masterclass in world-building through specific, purposeful detail. The wasteland orchard is not mere backdrop but an active participant in the plot, from the Geiger counter's clicks to the plot-critical hexagonal scars on the apples. The environment directly constrains Marisol’s choices and powerfully charges the final, transformative image of the rotting fruit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The central stake—what to do with a terrible truth—is established early and escalates with precision. The conflict deepens significantly at the climax, shifting from an external search to a visceral internal struggle. Marisol's agency drives the resolution, and the cost of her choice is rendered with unmistakable clarity on the page through the decay of the orchard’s false bounty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is impeccably woven into every element, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The story explores the corrosive nature of lies and the destructive, yet necessary, power of truth with nuance. The final image of the apples browning offers a complex, non-literal answer to the central question, resisting a simplistic moral in favor of a lingering, resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with unwavering control, establishing a voice that is both literary and grounded. The narrative stance is confident, and Marisol’s perceptual signature—her focus on patterns and subtle environmental shifts—is consistent and character-driven. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that elevates the atmosphere throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Figurative language, such as the Geiger counter’s "angry cicada" click or the dust drifts like "ghost tides," is consistently fresh and effective. The sentences exhibit strong forward momentum with varied structure, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwritten passages, even under the pressure of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>This story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing post-apocalyptic tropes with a poignant, philosophical core concept. The idea of lies being physically imprinted onto nature (the hexagonal scars) and truth acting as a catalyst for decay is an ingenious and memorable conceit. The narrative fully commits to its premise, resulting in a conclusion that feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
