<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is exceptionally clear and undergoes a profound, earned transformation. Her interiority is rendered through a unique sensory palette, and the final choice to give rather than take memories feels like an inevitable culmination of her discovery. The character arc is compelling, moving from a desire to erase pain to a wiser impulse to integrate it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens, flowing from arrival to a powerful climax and resonant departure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Marisol's gift and a Conceptual Repricing of grief itself, is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost. Causality is textural and emotional, building pressure perfectly toward the final, transformative insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and atmospheric pressure, functioning as a character in its own right. Details like the fortress "weeping" salt and sand "fractured into tidal pool formations" are both vivid and thematically purposeful. The coral pavilion is not just a location but the crucible that forces the story's central change, satisfying the 9+ gate with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conflict escalates beautifully, deepening from a personal struggle against painful human memories to a confrontation with ancient, geological grief. This shift raises the stakes immensely. Marisol's agency in the climax—choosing to reverse her gift—is a decisive act with a legible cost, altering her being and resolving the conflict by transcending its initial terms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme is potent and develops organically from the story's central conceit, resisting simple morals. The final image of transformed sorrow is resonant and earned. However, the last sentence ("that the best recipes...") functions as a thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the insight that the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized, which holds it back from a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent. The story's central mechanic—tasting memories—provides a unique and powerful perceptual signature that shapes every observation. There are no slips in distance or unauthorized intrusions into other minds; the voice is an integral part of the story's success.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every line. The rhythm is masterful, slowing for reflection and quickening with overwhelming sensation. Figurative language, such as the pavilion opening "like a throat," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable ingenuity by taking a familiar concept (psychometry) and elevating it to a geological and philosophical scale. The synthesis of culinary metaphors with deep-time memory feels both surprising and inevitable. It transforms its tropes into something particular and emotionally resonant, resulting in a memorable and original work.</comment>
