<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireille’s motivation is consistently dramatized, moving from a specialized observer to an active participant. Her internal state is conveyed through superb sensory detail, and her ultimate choice to engage with the house is earned by the story's internal logic. The final paragraph lands a compelling cost, expanding her unique sensitivity from a gift into a potential burden, fulfilling the 9+ quick test of a choice with visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and atmosphere rather than conventional plot turns. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house's loneliness is pacified into a satisfied stasis—is executed on the page with precision. Mireille’s final reflection establishes a clear conceptual cost, making the story's before/after state perfectly legible and profound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative. The personification of the streetlights and the house's physical responses are integral to the plot and theme. The final image, connecting Mireille's solitary walk to the streetlights surrendering their "small dream," charges the closure with exceptional resonance, easily meeting the 9+ standard of the environment shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conflict is subtle, original, and masterfully handled. The dominant stake—understanding and pacifying the sentient architecture—escalates beautifully from passive observation to direct, ritualistic interaction. Mireille’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost is clearly articulated in the final lines, where the weight of her success suggests a much larger, more daunting future. The pressure deepens perfectly within the story's textural logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of loneliness, consciousness, and the porous border between the mundane and the magical is handled with sublime subtlety. The theme emerges organically from the central conceit and imagery (hush, breath, displaced objects), culminating in a final question that resonates powerfully without stating a moral. The closing image provides a non-literal, haunting answer to the story’s central question about sentient loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is the story's defining strength: a poetic, precise, and utterly unique perceptual signature that is sustained from the first sentence to the last. POV is flawlessly controlled, filtering every observation through Mireille's specific sensibility without a single misstep in tone or register. The prose itself has a rhythmic, incantatory quality that perfectly embodies the story's hushed, magical realism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating remarkable information density and rhythmic control. While the figurative language is dense, it remains coherent and purposeful, building atmosphere rather than obscuring meaning. There is a slight risk of overwriting in its sheer consistency, but it never crosses the line into muddle, and every sentence works to propel the story's unique textural drive forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a "creeping normality noticer" interacting with lonely, sentient architecture is fresh and brilliantly executed. The story transforms the haunted house trope into something gentler and more profound, using a unique synthesis of poetic logic, sensory detail, and emotional truth. The final turn toward a city-wide scale feels both surprising and inevitable, showcasing a high degree of conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
