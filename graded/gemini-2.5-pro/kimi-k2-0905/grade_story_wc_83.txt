<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is viscerally clear, stemming from a foundational trauma that is never sentimentalized. The internal conflict is expertly dramatized—the cold, calculating "death's accountant" versus the grieving husband—culminating in the apparition of his bride. The final choice is a perfect, earned synthesis of these contradictory impulses, transforming grief into a final, precise act of agency with the ultimate cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's causal structure is flawless, moving from inciting incident to a powerful conceptual repricing and decisive change with airtight logic. The Causal-dominant lens holds perfectly; each beat is a consequence of the last, driving relentlessly toward the ending. The closure unit is exceptional, landing with a legible, devastating cost that fulfills and recontextualizes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and mechanically essential. The floating observatory isn't just a backdrop; its transparent floor, quantum telescope, circuit breakers, and outer railing are all critical instruments for the plot. The final act, where a .003-degree shift in the telescope's alignment saves a village, is a masterful integration of setting into the story's climax, satisfying the 9+ gate with distinction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The central conflict—what to do with survivor's guilt and a terrible new power—is established immediately and escalates with precision. The stake deepens from a personal "mechanical grief" to a choice with global consequences. The tightening is driven by the protagonist's agency, and the final cost—his life for a village's—is unmistakable and scaled perfectly to the story's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the fusion of high-concept sci-fi and raw human grief. It poses a profound question about agency in the face of meaningless violence and answers it not with a moral, but with a resonant, complex final image. The "bleak exhilaration" of his sacrifice provides a lingering, non-literal answer that is intellectually and emotionally staggering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The first-person voice is impeccably controlled, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature that is both lyrical and analytical. The narrator's scientific worldview ("perturbation theory," "energy signatures") provides a unique and chilling lens for processing profound trauma. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, creating a voice that is at once intimate and devastatingly detached.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense, precise, and powerful, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as "fragments crumbled into stardust that tasted like my wedding cake," is consistently inventive and emotionally resonant. The syntax is varied and propulsive, creating a rhythm that carries the narrative's grim momentum without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>This story demonstrates exceptional ingenuity by synthesizing quantum physics, drone warfare, and a profound meditation on grief. The core concept of "harvesting" potential from the dead is both novel and thematically potent. The transformation of a personal tragedy into a calculated, world-altering act feels entirely original and is executed with a confidence that marks it as a singular artistic vision.</comment>
