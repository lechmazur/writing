<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. Naram-bel's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in a believable blend of intellectual longing and spiritual faith. His interiority is conveyed through potent, specific phrases like "encrypted devotion" and fear of "empirical irony," creating a complex portrait. The final act of renunciation is a profound change, fully earned by the story's established values and carrying a clear, significant cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story exhibits a flawless causal structure under a Hybrid lens, transitioning from a clear goal-oriented plot to a resonant textural conclusion. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis and Conceptual Repricing, lands with undeniable cost on the page as Naram-bel becomes the palace's secret. The persistent constraint of the approaching sunrise provides constant pressure, perfectly shaping the narrative's single, continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully rendered and integral to the plot, atmosphere, and theme. Details like "dust floated like pale constellations" and "glazed bricks murmuring equations" create a palpable sense of ancient, living mystery. The palace is not a backdrop but a mechanism; its architecture directly constrains and enables the central action, and the final image is inextricably charged by this specific, evocative space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are handled with precision and depth. The dominant stake—preserving knowledge against political erasure—is established immediately and intensified by the ticking clock of the coming regime. The escalation is driven by Naram-bel's own agency, moving from intellectual exercise to physical discovery. The resolution carries an unmistakable cost: his physical existence is traded for eternal guardianship, a powerful and earned final state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme—that pure knowledge, like mathematics, can transcend empire—emerges organically from the plot and imagery without a single didactic line. The concept of "empirical irony" provides a brilliant thematic pivot, where number unlocks the sacred. The story's final image of unsettled dust and lapis light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, achieving a profound and lingering emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice that perfectly suits the astronomer's scholarly and reverent mind. The narrative's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through metaphors of light, number, and constellations. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, drawing the reader into Naram-bel's "encrypted devotion" and making his final choice feel both inevitable and intimate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic variety, and precise, evocative word choice. Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring meaning. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a disciplined and confident control of craft from the opening sentence to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing mathematics, mysticism, and history into a singular, cohesive vision. The premise transforms a familiar trope (the scholar unlocking a secret) through its unique mechanics (the magic square as a key) and its poignant, unexpected resolution. The narrative feels entirely self-contained and inevitable in hindsight, a hallmark of true ingenuity.</comment>
