<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her perception drives the narrative, but her agency is largely reactive. The discovery of her name feels more like an external reveal than the resolution of an internal conflict. Her final transformation is an acceptance of an inherited fate rather than a choice born from contradictory impulses, which is thematically coherent but slightly less dynamic from a characterization standpoint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The structure is a masterful, escalating descent into a conceptual horror, perfectly suited to the Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is internally consistent, with each discovery logically leading to the next, deepening the mystery. The closure is a devastating Conceptual Repricing, where Mira's absorption into the building redefines the story's entire premise with a clear, absolute cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's most powerful and active element, functioning as a character, antagonist, and the central plot mechanism. Descriptions like the university's east wing being a "lung of moss and dripping memory" are both vivid and purposeful. The environment directly constrains the protagonist and charges the final, haunting image of the breathing room, making it indispensable to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central stake—Mira's identity and existence against the building's memory—is signaled early and escalates with relentless pressure. The deepening of the stakes is expertly handled, moving from a professional mystery to an inescapable ancestral horror. The final cost is total and unambiguous, earned through the protagonist's investigation and ultimate surrender to her legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "legacy's burden" is woven seamlessly through recurring images, the architect's diary, and the final narrative turn. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead delivering its thematic weight through the powerful conceptual reveal of the building-as-camera and Mira's fate. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about memory and inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice perfectly matched to the story's gothic and melancholic atmosphere. The narrative distance is expertly managed, drawing the reader into Mira's increasingly claustrophobic perceptual world. The prose has a distinct rhythmic and textural signature that feels both deliberate and immersive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language, and a compelling rhythm. Lines like "light became shadow and laughter a hollow skull" are both beautiful and chilling, doing significant work to build atmosphere and theme. The writing is consistently concise and powerful, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwritten passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of an architectural structure as a centuries-spanning camera is brilliantly original, transforming the haunted house trope into a profound meditation on memory and inheritance. The synthesis of acoustics, architecture, and analog photography feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its high-concept premise, executing it with a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
