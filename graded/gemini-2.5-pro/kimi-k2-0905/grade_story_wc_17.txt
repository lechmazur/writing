<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation shifts organically from professional inquiry to a deeply personal, inherited quest. The transformation is driven by external discoveries rather than a pronounced internal struggle between contradictory impulses, which is a valid choice but slightly less dynamic. The final change is earned by the story's escalating logic, representing a complete, if horrifying, character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where each discovery builds atmospheric and narrative pressure toward the ending. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: Mira's transformation into the echo she was hunting is a devastating, on-page cost. The final image of the looping job posting provides a chilling resonance that redefines the story's premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the story's central mechanism and antagonist. Descriptions like "a lung of moss and dripping memory" are both evocative and functional, establishing the building as a living, breathing entity. The environment directly constrains and ultimately absorbs the protagonist, making it an exemplary case of setting as fate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate with masterful precision, moving from a professional task to a confrontation with ancestral trauma, and finally to existential annihilation. The pressure is relentless, driven by Mira's own agency as she chooses to investigate deeper. The cost is absolute and legible on the page, fulfilling the conflict's dark promise without compromise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "legacy's burden" is introduced explicitly but develops into something far more visceral and complex through the central metaphor of the camera-building. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a resonant, haunting loop in its final lines. The ending perfectly crystallizes the theme of inescapable, repeating history without ever stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person POV is flawlessly controlled, maintaining a tight psychic distance that immerses the reader in Mira's dawning horror. The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and confident, with a perceptual signature that selects details perfectly suited to the eerie tone. The prose rhythm and syntax modulate effectively as the tension mounts, demonstrating high-level craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for plot and atmosphere. Figurative language, such as the negative strip "curled like a sleeping serpent," is consistently fresh and integrated. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the line-level execution is clean and powerful, carrying the story's conceptual weight effortlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a building as a slow-exposure camera recording its entire history is brilliantly original and rigorously executed. It synthesizes familiar gothic horror, sci-fi, and climate fiction tropes into a seamless and haunting new form. The story's internal logic is both surprising and, in hindsight, feels utterly inevitable, marking a work of significant ingenuity.</comment>
