<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from professional duty to a deeply personal quest rooted in her mother's history. The final choice at the server block feels entirely earned, a powerful culmination of her established values and the story's central wound. The transformation from a corporate functionary to a living, broadcasting memory is a potent and well-executed character arc with a clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story exhibits a flawless causal structure, with each discovery logically precipitating the next. The inciting incident (the hashtag), the investigation (the patch and lullaby), and the point of no return (the lie to security) form a tight, propulsive chain. The closure—a Decisive Change with a profound Conceptual Repricing—lands with immense power and visible cost, perfectly satisfying the Causal lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, using specificity to drive the plot. The initial "social network archive" with its "ghosts" establishes the mood, but the "decommissioned server farm" is the standout. Details like the crystal blocks humming notes of the lullaby and Block 73 glowing warmer are inspired. The setting directly constrains choice via the firewall's bargain and charges the final image of the empty block, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and escalate with precision. The conflict moves from intellectual curiosity to a high-risk personal mission. The critical tightening occurs at the server block, where the protagonist is forced to trade her identity for the truth, foreclosing any return to her former life. This choice is driven by her agency, and the cost is made starkly, unforgettably legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story masterfully develops its themes of memory, corporate dehumanization, and the commodification of grief through action and imagery rather than statement. The core concept of "grief-clicks" is chilling and resonant. The final image of the blank user posting a chord provides a non-literal, haunting answer to the story's central questions about absence and data, leaving a powerful thematic echo without a shred of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and possesses a distinct literary texture that perfectly matches the story's high-concept, melancholic world. The third-person limited POV is controlled, revealing information with precision and filtering the technologically dense world through the protagonist's specific, emotionally resonant perceptions. There is no head-hopping, and the prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative, consistent metaphors ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "train that rattled like a dying hard drive"). While the figurative language is pervasive, it remains coherent and builds the story's unique atmosphere rather than obscuring it. The sentences are well-paced and clear, with no loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>This story demonstrates exceptional originality. It synthesizes familiar sci-fi tropes—the evil corporation, rogue AI, data ghosts—into a fresh, emotionally grounded narrative. The central mechanism of the mystery, a lullaby's frequency unlocking a map to a server farm where memories are literally frozen, is an ingenious and memorable conceit that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
