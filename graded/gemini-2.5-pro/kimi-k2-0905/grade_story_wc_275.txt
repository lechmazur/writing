<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation to reconcile her parents’ opposing legacies is clear and potent. Her interiority is well-rendered through concrete perceptions, like the canvas resembling her mother's hands. The central conflict is compellingly internal, but the character’s self-awareness sometimes feels too articulate, bordering on diagnostic, particularly in the final summary of her own realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is a pristine single scene following an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through memory and symbolic action. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the act of planting the hybrid rose redefines continuity and peace; the cost is the acceptance of her father's violent legacy into her own life, made tangible in the final image of listening to the roots take hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the cracked glass dome acting as a crucible for the story's themes of fragility and perseverance. Sensory details are specific and purposeful, from the "scent of roses and ruin" to the roses blooming brighter over blood-soaked earth. The setting directly constrains and enables the final choice, with the greenhouse itself becoming a character and charging the final image with meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to integrate a violent past with a peaceful present—is established immediately and deepens effectively. The key tightening occurs when Mira decides to weave the sandbag scrap into the rose stem, a decisive choice that forces a trade-off and forecloses the option of simply rejecting her father's legacy. The cost is legible in the final act, a transformation of grief into a living memorial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of integrating opposing forces is powerfully embodied in the central metaphor of grafting. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. The final two paragraphs contain thematic summaries—"Mira understood now that to weave continuity through chaos meant accepting all threads"—that function as a stated moral, slightly weakening the resonance of the final, much stronger, image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates well with the story's emotional weight. The perceptual signature is excellent, filtered through Mira’s "senselessly perceptive eyes" in a way that feels earned. Psychic distance is managed perfectly, drawing the reader into her introspective, focused state without any leakage or authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and precise imagery ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet"). However, there are minor instances of abstraction and repetition that create slight drag. The phrase "inculcating plants with values" appears twice and reads like a conceptual label rather than an organic description, and the final paragraphs engage in some thematic paraphrase-looping, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-disaster setting with a quiet, meditative story of horticultural grief is highly original. The central conceit of grafting a relic of violence into a symbol of peace transforms familiar tropes about legacy and healing into something tangible and memorable. The story fully commits to its unique premise, resulting in a resonant and non-obvious emotional arc.</comment>
