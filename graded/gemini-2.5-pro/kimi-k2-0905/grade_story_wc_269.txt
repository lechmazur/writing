<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a long-suffering witness is clear and consistent, driving her actions from ritual to investigation. Her interiority is conveyed effectively through evocative, embodied moments like the "eel waking in her chest." The final transformation of her purpose is earned by the story's events, providing a credible character arc, though a deeper sense of her internal contradictions before the inciting incident would have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in Causal-lens execution for short fiction. The chain of discovery—hollow wall, map, signal, ruins—is tight, logical, and propulsive. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, landing on the page with a clear reweighting of the protagonist's entire purpose, and the final image carries the cost of her new, eternal duty. The structure is flawless for its length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a powerful agent in the story, from the "white mantis" station to the "limestone ridge shaved clean of life." It's both atmospheric and functional, constraining the character (isolation, single-person sub) and providing the very mechanism for the climax. The final image, which re-frames the station as "a gate left ajar," demonstrates how setting is used to charge the story’s closure, fulfilling the 9+ criterion with distinction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a dominant stake—understanding a historical mystery—and escalates it perfectly when the radio signal turns it into an active, present-day summons. This deepening is driven entirely by Mira's agency as she investigates the anomalies. The cost is legible in the final beat, as her role shifts from passive grief to active, perpetual stewardship, a price that feels both profound and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus loss, and witnessing as an act of preservation rather than mourning, emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the line "Mira realized her role was never to prove loss but to remember the way back" verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and keeping it just shy of a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone. The prose has a clear perceptual signature; we see this world through the specific lens of a grieving scientist. The narrative distance is managed beautifully, drawing the reader close during moments of revelation without ever breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, precise language ("fish weaving bright alphabets," "cartographic skin"). The prose is rhythmic and clear, propelling the narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. While dense with figurative language, it rarely feels overwritten and consistently serves character and atmosphere without obscuring the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar eco-fiction and mystery tropes into a fresh, poignant narrative. The specific mechanism of the tapping code linking a personal habit to ancient technology is ingenious and feels inevitable in hindsight. By focusing on a transformation from grief to guardianship, it offers a non-obvious and emotionally resonant take on the "last human" archetype.</comment>
