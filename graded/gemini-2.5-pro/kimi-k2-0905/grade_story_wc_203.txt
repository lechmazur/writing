<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a compelling fusion of blue-collar competence and supernatural sensitivity. Her motivation evolves organically from a practical goal (the mainspring) to a spiritual responsibility, with the final realization that the "cracks in the façade" are internal providing an earned, resonant change. The contradiction of being an "unwilling" seer who nonetheless engages ghosts with firm politeness creates a subtle, consistent internal conflict that pays off in her final choice to carry their burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where each discovery builds atmospheric and thematic density toward a powerful closure. The inciting incident (lights go out) leads to a clear sequence of actions, and the ending provides a profound Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s role is redefined, and she accepts the cost on-page. The inferred drive lens holds perfectly, and the final image of the ticking mainspring makes the story’s new reality undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant, a character that "exhaled into darkness" and "wanted to bargain." Sensory details are evocative and purposeful, from the "glitter the color of rust" to the "gears tall as tombstones." The environment directly constrains and enables the action—the dust patterns are a map, the counter must be climbed, and the hidden ladder provides the path to the climax, perfectly satisfying the requirement for setting to shape choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story masterfully braids a tangible external stake (acquiring the mainspring) with a potent internal/supernatural stake (releasing the ghosts). Pressure escalates beautifully from atmospheric tension to physical challenge (the climb) to a final, delicate act of repair. The resolution is entirely driven by Mara’s agency, and the cost is made explicit and visceral in the final paragraphs as she accepts the ghosts' stories into herself, a "weightless burden" made tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, never stated. The central metaphor connecting mechanical repair with spiritual release—elevators, ceilings, mainsprings, and "vertical desire"—is original and resonant. The story's final image offers a non-literal, deeply moving answer to its central questions about memory, burdens, and what it means to "fix" something broken, achieving a rare level of thematic grace and complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly controlled, establishing a distinct narrative voice that is at once pragmatic and poetic. Mara’s perceptual signature—reading the world "like schematics"—is consistent and provides a unique lens for the supernatural events. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the action, from the quiet observational opening to the tense climb and the resonant stillness of the conclusion, demonstrating complete mastery of voice and distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language ("buttons missing like knocked-out teeth," "moonlight dripped through broken stained glass"), and a propulsive, controlled rhythm. Every sentence serves a purpose without a single wasted word or clichéd phrase. The prose is a significant strength, elevating the story from a clever concept to a piece of literary art; it is clean, powerful, and utterly free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally original. The synthesis of an elevator technician's skillset with the role of a psychopomp is an ingenious and fresh conceit. Tropes of ghost stories are transformed through a grounded, blue-collar perspective that feels both authentic and profound. The execution is so seamless that the unique premise feels completely inevitable in hindsight, marking a work of significant ingenuity and singular vision.</comment>
