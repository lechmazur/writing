<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carver's motivation is clear and her internal state is well-realized through the "fiercely meditative" trait, which justifies the story's contemplative pace. The final change is profound. However, her agency is primarily observational; she follows and receives insight rather than making difficult choices under pressure, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully dynamic and contradictory in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, spiraling deeper into its central mystery. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is powerful and earned, landing on the page as the carver emerges transformed. The cost is the shattering of her old understanding and the acceptance of a new, more difficult purpose. All narrative elements cohere to produce this final, resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is a superb example of setting as an active force. It's not just a backdrop but a crucible for transformation, containing the story's central secrets (the chrysalises, the hidden headstones). Details like the "oak tree grew through the glass ceiling" are not merely descriptive but constrain the action and charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central stake—understanding the "shape of collective grief"—is established immediately and deepens with each discovery. The pressure escalates not through external opposition but through layered revelations, consistent with the accumulative lens. The final turn, realizing the poems are "small deaths," provides a powerful reweighting of the stake with a clear emotional and conceptual cost, forcing the protagonist to redefine her entire craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a transformative process is explored with originality and depth, using a rich tapestry of interconnected symbols (carving, butterflies, poetry). The final image of carving gardens is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered by moments of direct thematic statement, such as "it wasn't a stone to be carved, but a transformation," which slightly reduces the subtextual power of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the lyrical, meditative voice. The prose has a distinct, memorable texture, with a rhythmic quality that reinforces the "thundering calm" tone. The narrative stance is confident, guiding the reader through a series of surreal images without losing clarity or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally feeling overwrought and approaching a "purple prose" register. The final paragraph shifts into a more summary-like mode, explaining the transformation rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the closure, which slightly dulls the story's propulsive ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, lepidopterology, and poetry as metaphors for communal grief is exceptionally original. The story avoids familiar tropes, instead building a unique and coherent symbolic system. The central images—poems as shrouds, sleep-carved headstones with poem titles—are fresh, haunting, and feel inevitable in hindsight, marking a distinctive artistic vision.</comment>
