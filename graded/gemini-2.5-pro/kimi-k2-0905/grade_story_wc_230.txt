<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation for "safety" is immediately clear and powerfully grounded in the post-plague context. Her internal conflict between ingrained rationality and the undeniable supernatural relic is the story's engine. The final transformation, particularly the non-apology to her sister's ghost, demonstrates a profound and earned change, moving from occluding guilt to a form of fractured acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and thematic density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure unit, where the "curse" is re-contextualized as a new kind of safety, lands with resonant cost—the forfeiture of her old rational self. A minor deduction is for the incomplete final sentence, which slightly truncates the full on-page closure effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in integration; the hanging orchard is not a backdrop but the story's central actor. It constrains choice (preventing the easy disposal of the eye), reflects the protagonist's precarity ("torn fingernails"), and ultimately becomes the agent of resolution. Every detail, from the storm-stripped trees to the lightning-scarred bark, is purposeful and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—psychological safety—is established immediately and intelligently re-weighted throughout. The pressure escalates perfectly, moving from a personal curse to a communal responsibility when she realizes she cannot throw the eye into the river. The climax is a choice of agency (planting the eye), and the cost is a complete surrender of her former armored self, which is made beautifully legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of truth, guilt, and safety is nuanced and deeply integrated, emerging organically from image and action rather than statement. The final image of the orchard as a confessional offers a profound, non-literal answer to the narrator's quest. The story's central idea—that true psychological safety requires surrender, not armor—is beautifully and hauntingly realized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is exceptional from the opening line, establishing a perfect blend of rational observation and lyrical description that feels entirely unique to this character. The POV is controlled with unwavering precision, filtering every strange event through a mind trying to impose order. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature that makes the narrative voice unforgettable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is luminous, with high information density and striking, original metaphors ("lightning calligraphy," "moonlit bones"). However, the provided text ends with a critically incomplete sentence ("...the only feelings I catch are those the orchard has already"), which fundamentally damages the final line's impact and craft. This is a significant mechanical flaw at the most crucial moment, warranting a substantial deduction from an otherwise near-perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is a brilliant synthesis of post-apocalyptic, gothic, and magical realist elements into something wholly new. The premise feels both mythic and intensely personal. The transformation of a classic "cursed object" into a tool for communal healing and psychological integration is a genuinely ingenious and satisfying turn that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
