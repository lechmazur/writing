<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization is superb, established through a distinct professional identity and a core internal value ("weaves truth carefully"). Her arc is subtle but potent, culminating in "the first unguarded expression" she has allowed herself, a change earned through the story's events. The motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—pressing her hands to the ice, speaking to the glacier—are concrete embodiments of her unique capabilities and resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds through a series of resonant images rather than traditional causal links, yet the progression feels inevitable. The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the two snow globes re-prices the entire narrative, and the cost (the passengers dissolving, the glacier sealing) is made beautifully and melancholically legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in world-building through specific, evocative detail. Phrases like "a luxury liner folded inside a glacier like a secret" and "love letters had fused into a single diamond of ink" create a tangible, unique atmosphere. The glacier is not a backdrop but an active character, constraining choice and shaping the final resolution, which satisfies the 9+ gate with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story handles a metaphysical conflict with tangible stakes. The dominant stake—salvaging something pure—is established immediately and deepens from a rescue mission into a quest for understanding. The primary tightening occurs when the glacier cracks the shrine, forcing a point-of-no-return decision. The final cost is clear and earned, making the protagonist's agency and the resolution feel significant and complete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is achieved with exceptional artistry, emerging organically from the central images of the snow globes, ice, and light. The theme—that memory can be salvaged and that "wreckage can cradle light"—is demonstrated rather than stated. The final image of the pure globe and the mirror of ice provides a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive, confident, and lyrical from the first sentence, maintaining a perfect psychic distance that suits the mythic quality of the story. The point of view is flawlessly controlled, filtering the fantastical events through Marrow's specific perceptual lens. The prose has a unique rhythm and texture that is consistent and serves the story's melancholic, wondrous tone without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and precise. Every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum without a wasted word. Figurative language ("planetarium of collective sorrow," "hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness") is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing the disparate concepts of wreck-diving, cryology, and dream-walking into a coherent and memorable whole. The core premise and its execution feel entirely fresh, transforming the familiar trope of a ghost's "unfinished business" into something far more profound. The specific imagery, from the ship in the glacier to the memory-jellyfish, is inventive and unforgettable.</comment>
