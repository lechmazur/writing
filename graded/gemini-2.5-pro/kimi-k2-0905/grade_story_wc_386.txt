<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marrow's character is established with a strong, specific voice and clear motivation. Her interiority is concrete and compelling, particularly her professional competence balanced with a unique perceptual filter. The final earned smile marks a clear, credible shift. The characterization is held back from the 9+ band only because her core internal conflict, while present, reads more as a steady resolve than a moment of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building from a dream-state inciting incident to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure. The structure is elegant and efficient, with each beat deepening the central mystery and stakes. The final image of the mirrored ice provides a resonant, on-page closure with a clear, felt conceptual cost—Marrow’s acceptance of her lifelong role as a translator—satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional. The setting is not merely a backdrop but a primary force in the narrative, from the "luxury liner folded inside a glacier like a secret" to the shrine that cracks open in response to Marrow's plea. The environment actively constrains and enables action, charging the central conflict. The final image, where the snow globe transforms into a mirror of ice, shows a micro-setting element directly embodying the story's resolution, a masterful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake—salvaging "something pure"—is established early and pursued with unwavering focus. Pressure escalates beautifully through an accumulative structure, moving from psychic whispers to a direct confrontation with the glacier's immensity. The final reveal deepens the stake's meaning rather than simply resolving it, and the cost is Marrow's acceptance of her future, making the resolution feel both earned and profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme is woven into the story's fabric through potent, recurring imagery (snow globes, windows, light in wreckage) rather than overt statements. The final image of the mirror offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about memory and salvation. The piece is docked slightly for a single line, "the knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light," which borders on a direct thematic summary, momentarily thinning the subtext at a crucial point.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is the story's triumph—a lyrical, controlled, and deeply specific third-person POV that creates a distinct and memorable perceptual signature. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, drawing the reader into Marrow's unique sensory world ("a hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness"). The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the story's tension, demonstrating complete command of the narrative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is fresh and integral to the story's world ("ballroom ghosts still dancing in formalwear stiff with rime"). There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; the momentum is controlled and purposeful. The sentences are constructed with a poet's ear for rhythm and a storyteller's drive for clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of familiar tropes—ghosts, shipwrecks, dreams—into a singular and haunting vision. The concept of "cameo appearances" in dreams as a key to a collective unconscious is ingenious, and the glacier as a living archive is a powerful central metaphor. The narrative feels entirely unique, authentic, and inevitable in its execution, demonstrating a rare level of conceptual and artistic integrity.</comment>
