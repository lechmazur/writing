<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear and their interiority is rendered with exceptional, particular detail. The internal conflict between survival as a “clerical error” and the will to continue is embodied, not just stated. The choice to repurpose the therapist's term "somatic markers" into a private, visceral system is a brilliant character-specific detail that elevates the narrative beyond simple trauma processing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's decision to release the photograph and make a new covenant with herself constitutes an on-page change with a clear, felt cost. The final image re-weights the entire story, making the "before/after" shift in her stance toward survival legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the central engine of the story's emotional and thematic logic. The arboretum functions as a "micro-setting" mapped directly onto the protagonist's body, constraining her choices and charging the final image. The specific flora (dragon's-blood pine, Arbutus unedo) are indispensable to the character's coping mechanism, making the environment a character in its own right.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The internal stake—finding a way to live with survivor's guilt—is established immediately and deepens through the protagonist's ritual. The "freeze" exercise serves as a powerful turn, an act of agency that changes her relationship to the traumatic memory. The cost of this shift is made tangible and poignant in the letting go of the photograph, foreclosing the path of clinging to the physical past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a landscape to be learned rather than a battle to be won emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension. While the two "I think:" statements verge on thematic summary, they are framed as hard-won personal conclusions, earned by the visceral work preceding them, thus avoiding the trap of unearned moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The first-person voice is masterful: controlled, lyrical, and possessing a distinct perceptual signature shaped by grief and botanical knowledge. The prose has a unique rhythm and texture that modulates with the character's internal state, particularly during the "freeze" exercise. POV is impeccably stable, and the narrative distance is perfectly calibrated to create intimacy without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and fresh, powerful figurative language ("the blast as a red chrysanthemum opening"). There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the story's emotional and atmospheric pressure. The prose is clear and propulsive, achieving a poetic quality without ever sacrificing clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's core concept—mapping trauma onto an arboretum via somatic markers—is profoundly original and brilliantly executed. It revitalizes the survivor's guilt narrative by grounding it in a unique, tangible system of coping. The synthesis of botany, trauma psychology, and memory feels wholly authentic and inevitable in hindsight, marking a distinct and memorable artistic vision.</comment>
