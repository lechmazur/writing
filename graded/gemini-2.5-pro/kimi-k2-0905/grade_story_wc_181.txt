<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is deeply convincing, rooted in her specific intellectual history. The backstory of her three bathroom breakthroughs provides a solid, unique foundation for her climactic fourth realization, making her ultimate refusal of forbidden knowledge feel earned and character-particular rather than a stock moral choice. The internal conflict between intellectual curiosity and the dread of entrapment is embodied and sustained perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal structure is immaculate, with each step logically compelling the next, from Quell's note to the confrontation in the asteroid's core. The closure, a Decisive Change leading to an Earned Stasis, is powerful and lands with clear conceptual cost. However, the story is marred by its final, incomplete sentence fragment ("to spit out"), which truncates the denouement and slightly undermines the otherwise flawless structural integrity at the last moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a triumph of speculative imagination and narrative function. The "astral orchard" and the translucent outhouse are not mere backdrops but integral mechanisms of the plot, directly constraining choice and enabling the story's central turn. The specific detail of parchment-walled roots visualizing nonlinear inheritance is a brilliant piece of world-building that charges the final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story masterfully escalates its stakes from an academic mission to a choice of profound personal and existential consequence. The central conflict—the pursuit of knowledge versus the preservation of self—is made concrete and urgent by Quell’s appearance. Lira’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost of her choice is rendered with palpable weight in the image of the dissolving shell and its "faint salt-sweet taste of unmade choices."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of inheritance, knowledge, and choice is sophisticated and seamlessly integrated. The motif of bathroom epiphanies is used with startling effectiveness, grounding abstract philosophy in a concrete, personal history. The final image of the index left as a "cameo of silence" provides a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story's central questions, elevating the piece beyond its plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently controlled, scholarly, and imbued with a poetic precision that perfectly captures Lira's "brightened disquiet." The point of view remains tightly focused, filtering the fantastical setting through a specific and believable perceptual lens. Dialogue is sparse but pivotal, with Quell's lines functioning as a direct challenge that crystallizes the story's core dilemma.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and fresh, evocative imagery like "sunlight on a scalpel" and "flames neon pink, the color of correction fluid." The prose is nearly flawless until the very last line. The final, abrupt sentence fragment is a significant technical error that disrupts the story's rhythm and cadence, leaving the conclusion feeling unpolished and detracting from an otherwise masterful performance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is a highly original synthesis of science fiction, magical realism, and philosophical inquiry. Concepts like memory-fruit, nonlinear inheritance made visible, and bathroom-portals feel fresh and fully realized. It transforms the familiar trope of the tempting "forbidden knowledge" into a unique and memorable narrative that feels inevitable in its strange logic.</comment>
