<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Characterization is superb, achieving a rare balance of economy and depth. Mirage’s internal conflict—the cynical professional versus the guilt-ridden lover—is dramatized through her actions, from the initial verbal jab to the final written confession. The line “I mistook your depression for possession because haunting sells better than hurting” is a devastatingly precise moment of self-awareness that earns her change, foreclosing her past identity with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's structure is flawless, operating as a single, perfectly calibrated scene under a Causal lens. The setup is immediate and clear, and the plot advances through a tight sequence of cause and effect. The closure unit is a masterclass, combining a Decisive Change (Julian’s dissolution, Mirage’s renunciation of her career) with a Conceptual Repricing (the archive’s hum dropping "forever out of tune"), landing an unforgettable final image with undeniable, multifaceted cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, satisfying the 9+ gate with ease. The sheet music archive, a place of "frozen chords" and impending destruction, both constrains the action and provides the very medium for the climax. The final resonant sound of the orchard and the altered hum of the archive are deeply integrated into the story's closure, making the environment indispensable to the emotional and thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The central stake—achieving genuine reconciliation before the physical record of the past is obliterated—is established immediately and escalates with precision. The pressure is both internal (Mirage's guilt) and external (the chainsaws). The key tightening occurs when Mirage moves from spoken words to the forbidden, permanent act of writing her confession, a choice driven by her agency that carries the unmistakable cost of her professional identity and self-deception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story explores its themes of exploitation, apology, and the commodification of pain with stunning sophistication. The central concept of the "imperfect miracle"—an apology that can be heard but not perfectly repeated or sold—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. Julian’s line, “pain is public domain,” provides a sharp thematic counterpoint that avoids any simple moral, leaving a complex and lingering aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, establishing a distinct and compelling narrative voice from the first sentence. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, filtering the world through a lens of headlines, sound, and electrical currents. The voice is literary and confident, and its metaphorical density feels entirely organic to a character who built a career on turning life into copy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, as in “each stack a frozen chord” or “the way moonlight smiles on broken glass.” The prose is entirely free of scaffolding or loops, with every sentence propelling the narrative forward or deepening the atmosphere, culminating in a powerful and precise final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The premise of a "gossip-column exorcist" is brilliantly original, and its execution transforms a familiar ghost story into a profound commentary on media and memory. The synthesis of the supernatural with the culture of celebrity gossip is fresh and insightful. The story's specific mechanics, particularly the nature of the "imperfect miracle," feel unique and inevitable in hindsight, marking this as a work of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
