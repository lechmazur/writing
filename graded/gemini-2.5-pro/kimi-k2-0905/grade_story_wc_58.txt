<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is compelling and her internal journey is rendered with concrete, character-particular interiority. The shift from seeking a physical place of healing to understanding it as an internal process is earned. The final realization that she was her own first client is a powerful turn that recasts her entire seven-year journey as a necessary act of self-creation, fulfilling the arc with a visible cost (a life lived in absence).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, with the central ritual in the garden building meaning layer by layer. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final image of planting the thread and the paths spelling out words redefines the entire premise with a clear conceptual cost—her seven years of absence. Orientation is immediate and the single-scene structure maintains focus and pressure, making the final release deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, satisfying the 9+ gate. The "shadowed garden" directly reflects and responds to the protagonist's internal state, with fallen leaves forming patterns of words and shadows becoming portals. The final reveal—that the paths themselves spell out the story's core truth—charges the final image and makes the environment indispensable to the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful, singular stake: the traveler's need to understand healing and resolve her own state of absence. The pressure deepens through the protagonist's own agency as she performs the intimate ritual of unmaking the thread. The cost is made explicit and felt in the final recognition of the life she sacrificed, which satisfyingly resolves the internal conflict by transforming her understanding of that sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming absence into a chosen presence is explored with profound ingenuity through the story's central conceits. However, the final third veers into thematic summary. Lines like "...writing obituaries for the living had never been about death but about the lonesome splendor of choosing one's own ending" and "...the geography of healing revealed itself as the courage to be witnessed" are Thematic Echoes that state the theme too directly, slightly undermining the power of the imagery that had already conveyed it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is masterful—lyrical, melancholic, and utterly consistent, establishing a fable-like tone from the first sentence. The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, filtering the fantastical events through the traveler's specific, professional, and weary perceptual signature. The prose rhythm and elevated diction feel earned by the story's allegorical nature and never falter, even under the pressure of the climactic revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with a varied sentence structure that supports the story's incantatory rhythm. The figurative language is both beautiful and functional, driving the story's unique logic. While the density of metaphor is high, it rarely feels overwritten and instead contributes to the Accumulative/Textural drive. A few phrases feel slightly too abstract ("whatever force collected explained absences"), but these are minor and do not detract from the momentum or clarity of the powerful closure scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is built on a highly original and memorable premise—writing obituaries for the living as a form of healing. It synthesizes magical realism with a deep psychological inquiry, creating a world and a logic that feel entirely its own. The transformation of the central metaphor, from a map to a process to a seed, is an act of genuine ingenuity that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
