<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal transformation is earned with a palpable cost—seven years of a lonesome, extraordinary life. Her contradictory impulses as both a healer of others and an escapee from her own past are embodied in her actions. The final recognition of herself as her own first client is a powerful, earned beat that lands with precision, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for an earned choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building meaning through layered imagery toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure. The realization that she was her own first client re-weights the entire narrative with a clear, felt cost tied to her seven years of self-imposed exile. The structure is elegant and the final on-page action of planting the thread provides a perfect, concrete anchor for the abstract resolution, satisfying the 9+ test with distinction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The "shadowed garden" is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the story's resolution, a masterclass in using setting to drive plot and theme. The environment directly responds to the character's work, with shadows becoming portals and paths spelling words that charge the final image. This integration of setting as a constraining and revealing force is seamless and evocative, easily meeting the criteria for excellence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful, dominant internal stake—the search for healing—and deepens it through the protagonist's direct agency in the act of unwinding the thread. The escalation is not one of external action but of internal revelation, culminating in a confrontation with her past that forces a costly re-evaluation of her life's work. The price of her seven-year absence is made unmistakable on the page, fulfilling the requirements for a high score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of choosing one's ending and turning absence into presence emerges organically and with immense power from the story's core conceit. However, the final third occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements, particularly "She realized then that writing obituaries...had never been about death but about the lonesome splendor..." This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by explicitly stating what was already powerfully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a mythic yet intimate tone that is the story's greatest strength. The third-person POV maintains a consistent psychic distance, while the protagonist's perceptual signature—seeing the world as text and story—is brilliantly realized. The prose itself becomes a reflection of the character's "vividly descriptive" trade, achieving a rare and cohesive synthesis of voice and concept.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with striking imagery and precise word choice. However, the final two paragraphs fall into summary and paraphrase, restating the transformation that the climax just finished dramatizing. This narrative scaffolding at the story's most critical moment dulls the impact of an otherwise pristine piece, constituting a prose artifact that measurably affects the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of an obituary writer for the living is exceptionally fresh and thoughtfully explored. The story synthesizes themes of grief, narrative, and healing into a magical realist framework that feels both innovative and emotionally true. It commits fully to its unique logic, resulting in a resonant and memorable piece that transforms familiar human experiences into something genuinely new.</comment>
