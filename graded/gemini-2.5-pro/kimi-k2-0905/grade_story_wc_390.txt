<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. Mireya’s motivation is immediately clear and deeply felt. Her defining trait, "logically emotional," is not merely stated but dramatized in the pivotal "calculus" that forces her to find a third path. Her competence as an engineer is seamlessly blended with her role as a mystical guardian, and the final image of her tears tasting of "salt, iron, and whale song" provides a powerful, embodied closure that feels earned by the prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story follows a Hybrid lens, primarily Accumulative/Textural, and executes it flawlessly. The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene that escalates pressure toward a clear closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The final state is stable, but the cost is made tangible in the worn-smooth key and Mireya's acceptance of a new, perpetual duty. The causality, operating on its own unique sonic logic, is consistent and compelling from start to finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not a backdrop but a primary force in the narrative. The drift-ice marina is alive, its sounds providing crucial information and its physical instability ("the ice beneath her feet began to calve") directly shaping the central conflict. The environment constrains Mireya's choices, forcing her climactic innovation. The final image of the ice remembering mercy powerfully charges the closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are masterfully handled. The initial stake—saving the artifact—is immediately complicated by a brilliant tightening: the choice between saving the artifact (destroying the town) and sacrificing it (unleashing nightmares). Mireya’s agency in forging a third path is the heart of the climax, and the cost is legible and poignant. The resolution is earned entirely through her decisive action, which redefines the nature of victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable economy. The story explores mercy, memory, and connection not through statement but through resonant images: the glacier's memory in the ice, the mother whale's call, the shadows becoming a choir. The resolution—"teaching darkness to listen"—is a profound, non-literal answer to the central conflict that avoids simplistic morals and lingers powerfully after the story ends.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is singular, confident, and sustained. The elevated, lyrical prose establishes a distinct perceptual signature for Mireya, blending the technical ("frequencies," "axis") with the mythic ("crypt keeper's key," "sonic absolution"). Psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into Mireya's sensory experience and internal calculus without ever breaking its tightly-woven atmospheric spell. The result is immersive and stylistically coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense, musical, and highly polished. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as the sunset "like a wound healing in reverse" and the key's teeth "filed into frequencies." While the language is consistently elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and propulsion even in its most lyrical moments. There are no discernible loops or artifacts; every sentence serves to build pressure or deepen the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional ingenuity. It synthesizes disparate, fascinating concepts—acoustic engineering, cryo-acoustics, cetacean biology, and hauntology—into a completely coherent and original magical system. The core conflict is resolved not with force, but with empathy and adaptation, a genuinely fresh and insightful turn that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable. This is a memorable and uniquely imagined world.</comment>
