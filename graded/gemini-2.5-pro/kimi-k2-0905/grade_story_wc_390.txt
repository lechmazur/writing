<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is crystalline, and her interiority is powerfully embodied through her unique sensory perception of the world as resonance. Her defining trait ("logically emotional") is expertly dramatized in the climax, where she rejects a binary choice for a third, more complex path. The final choice and its emotional cost—tears that taste of the entire conflict's elements—are earned by every preceding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure unit is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, achieving a new, stable state for the town, the artifact, and the shadows. The cost is made tangible in the worn-smooth teeth of the key and Mireya's emotional release, demonstrating a mastery of plot mechanics at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not merely a setting but a crucial, active participant in the plot. Its sounds provide the story's core tension and its memory holds the key to the resolution. The environment directly constrains the central choice—its potential shattering is a primary stake—making the setting indispensable to the story's climax and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stakes are established immediately and escalate to an acute, seemingly impossible dilemma. The central conflict tightens perfectly, forcing the protagonist to move beyond a simple good/bad choice to a creative, risky solution. Agency drives the resolution, and the cost is legible, making the final earned stasis feel both profound and precarious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of healing through listening—of absolution as a shared resonance—emerges organically from the plot, character, and setting. The story avoids any moralizing, instead offering a final image of transformed shadows that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of consuming darkness. The concept of teaching darkness to listen instead of destroying it is sophisticated and beautifully executed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly controlled, with a distinct and consistent perceptual signature rooted in sound and vibration. The voice maintains its elevated, lyrical register without faltering under pressure, perfectly capturing the "fleshly ethereal" tone. Every observation is filtered through Mireya's unique professional and personal lens, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense, muscular, and highly figurative, with exceptional sentence-level propulsion. While the figurative language is pervasive, it remains coherent and purposeful, rarely slipping into overwrite. The phrase "logically emotional calculus" is a minor register wobble in an otherwise masterfully controlled piece, but the line-level craft is of publishable quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic engineering, cetacean biology, and supernatural horror feels startlingly original. The story transforms the familiar trope of a guardian protecting an artifact by making the method of protection an act of empathy and adaptation rather than force. Its core mechanics and resolution are non-obvious and feel inevitable in hindsight, marking a work of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
