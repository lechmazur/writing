<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation and internal arc are clear and compelling, with his final choice to leave the lantern feeling earned. The characterization is strong, showing a consistent internal state of gentle grief and curiosity. However, the emotional progression is slightly too linear, lacking moments of sharp internal contradiction that would elevate it to exceptional; the change feels more like a serene evolution than a struggle between competing impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a deepening of atmosphere and empathy, not forced causal turns. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the janitor internalizes the lantern's light—is poignant and lands with the clear, felt cost of abandoning a treasured physical object and a former way of being. The progression from observation to participation to transformation is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is deeply immersive and integral to the plot, with the "hush of the overlooked era" and "dust motes like miniature galaxies" creating a potent atmosphere. The cracked yellow lantern glass functions as a perfect micro-setting, a tool that both constrains the initial action and becomes the crucible for the story's climax. The final image, an afterglow on every glass surface, demonstrates how the setting has been permanently charged by the events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant internal stake—the janitor's grief for a world that has forgotten to look up—is established early and escalates beautifully. The pressure deepens through his nightly empathic practice, culminating in a climactic vision that reconfigures his understanding. The resolution, where he chooses a new form of vulnerable openness, is a direct result of this escalation and carries the visible cost of leaving his old life and talisman behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of strength in vulnerability is powerfully developed through the central meteor metaphor. However, the story momentarily falters by stating its thesis directly: "understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere." This moment of telling, rather than showing, is a minor but significant flaw, preventing the theme from emerging purely through subtext and image and slightly undermining the otherwise resonant ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptionally controlled, maintaining a lyrical, melancholic, and wondrous tone that is perfectly suited to the fable-like story. The third-person limited POV has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the cosmic and mundane through the janitor's gentle, curious gaze. There are no slips in psychic distance, and the prose's rhythm and texture are consistent and purposeful from start to finish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is consistently elegant and imaginative, with high information density in its imagery ("keep the silence from rusting"). However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, with some sentences feeling more constructed for beauty than for raw, propulsive storytelling. While there are no technical errors or lazy constructions, a slightly more restrained hand in key moments could have increased its impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, blending a tender, character-focused story with a fresh sci-fi/magical-realism concept. The "cosmic janitor" archetype and the memory-hoarding lantern feel both unique and archetypally resonant. The story's ingenuity lies in its quiet, emotional exploration of a cosmic idea, transforming a simple observation into a profound meditation on empathy and change without resorting to cliché.</comment>
