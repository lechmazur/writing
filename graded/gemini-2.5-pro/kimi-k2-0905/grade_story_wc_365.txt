<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deepens from a general professional itch to a high-stakes personal quest. Interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion ("pulse, loud as launch drums"), avoiding abstraction. The final change—to chart consequences instead of places—is a powerful and earned renunciation of her past self, with the cost felt in the weight of her newfound complicity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory details and revelations rather than conventional plot turns. The structure is anchored and clear, and the central "loom" mechanic is taught and deployed effectively. The ending delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the protagonist's understanding of her life's work and grief is irrevocably reweighted, landing with a clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, its "ruined geometry" folding to enable the plot. Sensory details are specific, vivid, and filtered through the character's unique perception ("dust tasting of rust and forgotten fuel"). The green glass shard functions as a perfect micro-setting, a tool whose changing state both constrains choice and charges the final image when it goes dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding a withheld truth—is signaled immediately and escalates with perfect control. The deepening occurs when the mystery of a lost lover transforms into the horror of personal complicity in a military cover-up. This shift, driven by the protagonist's choice to follow the shard's lead, makes the final cost—the burden of her own history—feel immense and inescapable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the intricate weave of image and action, culminating in a resonant final understanding of truth, memory, and consequence. The story powerfully resists a simple moral, instead landing on the complex weight of complicity. The final image of the bay exhaling a "question she is finally ready to answer" provides a perfect, non-literal resolution that recharges the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and masterfully sustained, establishing a distinct perceptual signature focused on vibration, texture, and geometry. POV is tight and controlled, never wavering. The prose itself becomes character, with syntax and rhythm modulating to reflect the protagonist's internal state, from the dream-like opening to the stark clarity of the final resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense and highly figurative but maintains remarkable clarity and propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative ("bruised gold," "encrypted grief"), creating high information density where every line serves multiple functions. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating and decelerating in sync with the protagonist's journey.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar sci-fi tropes—parallel worlds, corporate conspiracy—into something genuinely fresh and memorable through its unique core concept of "sensory mapping." The "loom" metaphor for interdimensional travel is an ingenious and poetic invention. The originality lies in its textural, introspective approach to a revelation plot, transforming a potential thriller into a profound piece of literary fiction.</comment>
