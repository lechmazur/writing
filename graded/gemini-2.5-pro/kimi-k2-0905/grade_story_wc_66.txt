<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are a direct, believable extension of her craft as a copyist. Her character is revealed through meticulous, goal-oriented action rather than deep internal contradiction, which fits the story’s fable-like quality. The final choice to remain and copy the airborne score is a potent crystallization of her identity, showing a shift from preservation to active creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building density through a series of interlocking sensory details and actions that culminate in a powerful climax. The closure provides a Decisive Change with a clear conceptual cost (the end of the broadcast) and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the world's state. The final image of the transformed inspectors provides an undeniable, on-page verification of the story's central event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional detail; it's not a backdrop but a central character. The abandoned concert hall provides the very materials for salvation (rosin), and the mist transforms from a symbol of forgotten things into a medium for new stories. The recurring image of the radio dial's green glow acts as a perfect micro-setting, charging the final image with enduring hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central conflict between creative preservation and authoritarian silence is established immediately and deepens effectively toward a clear deadline—the winter solstice. The escalation is driven by Mila's agency as she moves from passive listening to active amplification. The climax delivers a decisive victory with a legible cost: the pirate frequency falls silent, forcing a new phase of resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of art's enduring power against erasure emerges with lyrical force, completely integrated into plot and image without a word of exposition. The central metaphor—teaching dust to sing—is developed with startling concreteness. The story’s final image offers a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to its central question, reweighting the meaning of silence, dust, and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with exceptional control, establishing a distinct and unwavering perceptual signature rooted in Mila's identity as a copyist. The world is consistently perceived through metaphors of music, sound, and silence, giving the narrative a unique and poetic texture. The prose rhythm perfectly matches the protagonist’s "thistled calm," creating a seamless fusion of voice and character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is both lyrical and precise, with a high density of information and imagery in every sentence. While highly figurative, the language avoids overwriting because the metaphors are integral to the story's internal logic, not ornamental. The syntax is varied and propulsive, carrying the reader through the quiet, meticulous preparations to the explosive, resonant climax without a single wasted word.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>While the "art-banning dystopia" is a familiar trope, the story's execution is brilliantly original. The central concept of encoding stories into musical intervals and amplifying them through rosin dust is a fresh, specific, and memorable synthesis. The story transforms its premise by focusing on the intimate, almost magical craft of its protagonist, creating a narrative that feels both timeless and entirely new.</comment>
