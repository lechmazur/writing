<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "persistently curious nature" and a desire to "protect vulnerable voices." Her actions align with these traits, and the embodiment of the pulses through sensory details like "penny candy and chlorine" is excellent. The characterization is slightly weakened by the authorial summary of her heroism ("In the incidental heroism of showing up…"), which feels like diagnostic label-speak rather than earned interiority, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean, causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The setup, escalation, and resolution are well-paced within the single scene. The closure—a Decisive Change (message delivered) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hearing aid's silence, the atrium as a carousel)—lands with palpable cost and finality. The coincidence of the sister's presence is justified by the story's internal, magical logic, making the structure feel both inevitable and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible for the story's action and theme. The "mist-clad atrium" is rendered with specific, evocative sensory details that support the mood perfectly. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (Mira searching the wall) and charges the final image, revealing its true shape as a "carousel frozen mid-spin." This transformation of the setting makes it an indispensable, active element of the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering Eleanor's message to grant her peace—is established early and pursued with focus. Pressure escalates effectively when the pulse grows "urgent," driving the protagonist's final action. The resolution is earned directly through Mira's agency, and the cost is legible in the sister's tears and the final, profound silence of the hearing aid. The conflict feels intimate, specific, and deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story builds a powerful, resonant theme of memory, connection, and the weight of promises through its central metaphor and imagery, particularly the recurring carousel. However, it falters significantly by explicitly stating its theme in the penultimate paragraph ("In the incidental heroism of showing up...she had given the dead their closing parentheses"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation, undermining the subtext so carefully crafted until that point.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a distinct and compelling narrative voice. The prose has a lyrical, confident rhythm, and the focalization through Mira's unique perception (hearing pulses, tasting memories) gives the story a memorable perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and the psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader close during moments of revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its figurative language ("swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light"). The rhythm is controlled, and word choice is consistently strong, creating a vivid atmosphere without overwriting. There are no technical flaws or distracting prose artifacts. The only minor weakness is the thematic summary near the end, which reads more like authorial scaffolding than organic prose, slightly disrupting the momentum before the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is highly original, offering a fresh, poignant twist on ghost stories and grief counseling. The story synthesizes magical realism with quiet emotional depth in a way that feels unique and fully realized. The execution is confident, avoiding clichés and delivering a memorable emotional experience grounded in its specific, inventive logic. The story's vision is authentic and its central metaphor is unforgettable.</comment>
