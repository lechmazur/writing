<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered with a specific, compelling voice. Her engineer's perspective, viewing hope as a system to be plumbed, is well-realized. The characterization is slightly held back by a lack of tangible internal conflict; she is almost purely competent, with her "smile without happiness" being the main hint of a more complex emotional cost. This efficiency serves the story's conceptual focus but keeps the character at a slight remove.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for its length, following a single character through a continuous scene toward a powerful conclusion. The accumulative/textural drive lens works perfectly, building symbolic weight with each action. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing (CR), transforming the terminal's meaning with a resonant final image and a clear, felt cost (Mara's quiet departure). The hanging final sentence is a minor blemish on an otherwise impeccable structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with exceptional atmospheric and sensory detail, from the "glitter-flecked glass" to the "service tunnel labeled CREW ONLY in ten languages." Crucially, the environment is not merely descriptive; it's an active participant in the plot, providing the very "plumbing" and tools (irrigation lines, emergency beacons) that Mara needs. The sextant piece and the terminal itself constrain her choices and charge the final, transformative image, meeting the highest standard for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a high-concept stake—the city's "sagging" hope—and makes it concrete through Mara’s engineering task. The conflict deepens effectively under an accumulative lens, moving from the internal system (pumps) to the external signal (beacon), which raises the stakes by inviting the public. The resolution is driven entirely by Mara's agency, and the cost is legible in her detached professionalism and anonymous departure, a subtle but fitting price for her "proof of concept."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme—that hope is an engineered system and departure can be rerouted into arrival—is brilliantly integrated. It emerges from every action and image rather than being stated, despite the initial setup. The final image of the beacon, the child's laugh as "datum zero," and the light-dripping pipes offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. It masterfully avoids a simple moral, instead presenting a complex, beautiful equation where "math proves kindness is structural."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Mara’s engineer-brained voice shapes every observation, turning the terminal into a "maze of intentions" and a "solvable circuit." The prose is elevated and poetic, but it feels earned and coherent within this specific character's "stoic wonder," resulting in a memorable and singular narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a varied rhythm and high information content in each line. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, consistently reinforcing the story's central themes and atmosphere. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the jarring, incomplete final sentence ("Weeks later, when the city above"), a significant prose artifact that abruptly truncates an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of "hope as a civil engineering variable" is highly original and thoughtfully explored. The story synthesizes sci-fi, engineering, and almost mythic elements (starlight, sextants) into a unique and resonant whole. It avoids genre clichés, offering a solution that is conceptual and symbolic rather than technological or violent. The vision feels authentic and fully realized, transforming a familiar "dying city" trope into something fresh and memorable.</comment>
