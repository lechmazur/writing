<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alya’s motivation to solve “unsolvable equations” is slightly abstract, but her character is powerfully realized through her concrete actions and a distinct interiority of “stoic wonder.” Her competence is balanced with a quiet, persistent hope, and her final shift in understanding—that repair, not departure, is the goal—is earned through on-page struggle and discovery. The final image of her small, stoic smile feels like a perfectly calibrated, earned emotional closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building from a quiet start to a resonant climax. The plot is a single, elegant causal chain of resurrection that feels both mechanically plausible and magical. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the terminal gains a "heartbeat" and Alya finds her "proof," lands with significant conceptual cost and provides a powerful before-and-after state without a single wasted move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric specificity, functioning as both the antagonist (entropy) and the source of the solution. Details like "raffle tickets that looked like failed star charts" and "rust had landscaped every surface into Martian vermillion" are vivid and purposeful. Crucially, the setting's components—pumps, sculptures, the arrivals board—are not just scenery but are integral tools that constrain Alya's choices and charge the final, resonant images.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting hope from entropy—is established immediately and escalates with poetic logic. The key deepening occurs when the architect’s hologram reframes Alya’s mission from mere problem-solving to a philosophy of reclamation ("measure what returns"). The resolution is driven entirely by Alya's agency, and the cost is the immense, solitary effort required to reverse decay, made tangible in the story’s atmosphere of ruin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the story's central actions and imagery, focusing on reclamation over escape. The realization that "failed departure had left vectors pointing inward, toward repair" is a profound thematic turn that feels earned, not stated. While the explicit equation for hope and the architect's advice tread close to overstatement, they function as resonant axioms within the story's lyrical register, reinforcing rather than merely summarizing the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is impeccably controlled, anchored in a voice that is both poetic and precise. Alya’s perceptual signature as an engineer who sees "pressure times area equals possibility" is unique and sustained. The narrative voice has a distinct, confident rhythm and texture that carries the story's tone of "stoic wonder" from the first sentence to the last, making the prose itself an engine of character and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional, with high information density and striking, original figurative language that consistently serves the story. Lines are meticulously crafted for rhythm and clarity, propelling the narrative forward while building a rich atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, action, or tone, culminating in a final paragraph that is both lyrical and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>While belonging to the hopeful subgenre of reclaiming ruins, the story's execution is highly original. The specific synthesis of civil engineering, celestial navigation tools, kinetic art, and a post-carnival spaceport is fresh and memorable. The concept feels fully integrated and inevitable in hindsight, transforming a familiar emotional arc into something that feels entirely new and authentic.</comment>
