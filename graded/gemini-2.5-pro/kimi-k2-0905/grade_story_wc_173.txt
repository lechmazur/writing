<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lys's characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of a "chaste courtesan" seeking to unleash raw emotion is powerfully rendered through embodied interiority, such as her blood answering the plinth "in iambs." Her motivation is clear and her final choice to remain and sing—refusing to become an echo herself—is an earned, resonant culmination of her arc, foreclosing the path of escape for a higher purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The plot structure is flawless for its length, executing a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ritualistic causality is clear and progresses with intensifying pressure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where freedom becomes a new "terrifying lullaby," lands with a palpable conceptual cost, legible in the final image of citizens tasting their own pulse, making the before/after state stark and meaningful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional detail. It's not a backdrop but an active participant; the "courtyard snow hissed and retreated" in response to Lys's actions, directly constraining her by revealing the failures of her predecessors. The final image, with the courtyard blooming and reflecting shattered starlight, powerfully recharges the opening description to signify the world's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story establishes its dominant stake—the city's freedom versus the "lullaby of conformity"—early and escalates pressure perfectly through the accumulative logic of the ritual. The deepening is driven by Lys's agency, with each untangled knot revealing higher stakes (the weeping statues). The cost of success is made explicit and visceral: her footprints of "blood and dew" and the "alarming serenity" of a terrifying new freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is expertly woven through image and action, never stated. The central conflict between enforced harmony and authentic, painful memory emerges organically from the "harvest of echoes" and the "hollow statues." The final image—citizens filling those statues with lanterns made from their own memories—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding a simple moral by embracing the complex terror of true agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person POV is controlled with masterful precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is the story's greatest strength, with a distinct, lyrical texture that is both elevated and intimate. The perceptual signature, filtered through the "bodily poetic" concept, ensures every description ("bruised violet and arterial red") feels unique to this character and world, creating a seamless and immersive experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a rhythmic cadence that supports the story's ritualistic momentum. While lushly figurative, the language avoids muddle; each metaphor serves to deepen the "bodily poetic" atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished, propulsive, and impactful read from the opening line to the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing familiar fantasy tropes into a unique and memorable aesthetic. The concept of a "chaste courtesan" as a liberator who traffics in stolen memories, guided by a "bodily poetic," feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The ending subverts the expectation of escape, offering a more complex and powerful choice that solidifies the story's unique vision.</comment>
