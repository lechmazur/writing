<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The undertaker's transformation from a reluctant, stubborn man into a willing, eternal caretaker is both profound and earned within the story's mythic logic. His motivation, rooted in an "unpaid debt to the departed," is clear and compelling. The final, quiet acceptance, where he sees his own name in the book, is a masterclass in character closure, showing a man who finally understands his place is not among the living but in service to the dead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with the seamless logic of a fable under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is elegant: summons, descent, task, and a new stasis. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts his new role, lands with the palpable cost of his former life and his own mortality, making the final image of him at the circulation desk immensely powerful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's crowning achievement—a world so vivid and inventive it becomes a character in itself. Details like the "brass octopus" catalog and "pages of compacted salt" are unforgettable and deeply integrated into the plot. The environment is not merely described; it actively constrains choice and charges the final image, with the circulation desk becoming the undertaker's throne and tomb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stakes—the eternal rest of countless souls—are established with cosmic weight, and the conflict feels both unique and elemental. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution; his ingenious use of memory and grief to create an "underwater conflagration" is a brilliant escalation. The final cost, his own perpetual service, is a perfect, poignant trade-off that feels both inevitable and deeply earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story masterfully explores themes of memory, duty, and the nature of rest without resorting to didacticism. The central metaphor of a library for souls is sustained with incredible creativity, culminating in a resonant final image. The last paragraph provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, turning the library into "a beacon that burns backward into the hearts of those still afraid."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is extraordinary—lyrical, solemn, and perfectly sustained from the first sentence to the last. The point of view is controlled with a poet's precision, creating a distinct perceptual signature that filters the fantastical events through the undertaker's weary but dutiful consciousness. Phrases like "the interval between heartbeats when the dearly departed almost speak" demonstrate a complete command of tone and rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and flawlessly executed, with not a wasted word. Figurative language, such as grief being translated into light "the way a prism translates sun into rainbow," is both beautiful and functional, advancing the plot while deepening the atmosphere. The rhythm is hypnotic, mirroring the underwater setting, and the piece is entirely free of scaffolding or line-level artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>This story is a stunning work of originality, synthesizing the archetypes of undertaker, librarian, and lighthouse keeper into something entirely new and resonant. The core premise is brilliantly imaginative and executed with a confidence that makes its fantastical rules feel inevitable. It avoids all cliché, offering a vision that is particular, memorable, and profoundly moving.</comment>
