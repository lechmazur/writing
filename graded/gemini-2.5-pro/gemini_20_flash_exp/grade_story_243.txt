<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's core traits ("jumpy necromancer," "typically bizarre") feel asserted rather than demonstrated. The "necromancer" aspect is entirely disconnected from the setting and actions, weakening credibility. Motivation is clear but lacks grounding in the established character type.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is functional for the word count, with the assigned action ("falter") creating a moment of tension and the method ("analyzing paint drips") driving discovery. However, the pacing feels slightly uneven, accelerating rapidly at the end. The core concept ("echoing footsteps") effectively raises stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "retro video game world" setting is adequately established with some fitting details ("pixelated neon glow"). The atmosphere supports the tension. However, the "old gods slumber" timeframe feels tacked on and disconnected from the immediate narrative and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear conflict and a theme of truth versus facade. It uses some imagery ("digital hammer blow"), but the overall craft lacks depth. The ending provides continuation but lacks significant emotional resonance or subtext. Showing vs. telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies on some common tropes (glitch as rogue program, hidden message in art) without significant subversion. The combination of necromancer and video game feels forced and arbitrary, lacking organic justification, hinting at potentially formulaic element combination. Language is functional but lacks a distinctive voice or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Cohesion suffers due to the poorly integrated "necromancer" element and "old gods" timeframe, making it feel like elements were included obligatorily rather than serving the story organically. While functional, it lacks the seamless integration and depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
