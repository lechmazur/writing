<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation (containing sorrow via artifacts/warding) is clear, but his 'dry-witted' trait is asserted rather than demonstrated in dialogue or action. Elara serves primarily as a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a concise arc driven by the confiscation action. However, the 'shared love for dance' element feels extraneous and doesn't meaningfully connect to or advance the central conflict concerning the rope and broken promises.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is effectively evoked with sensory details ("salt and regret") and strongly supports the atmosphere of lingering sorrow and forgotten things, aligning well with the core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the rope as a symbol for broken vows and explores the theme of containing grief. The central conflict is clear, though the dialogue is functional rather than particularly impactful or revealing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, the prose occasionally dips into slightly generic phrasing ("weight of things best left undisturbed"). The emotional landscape feels stated rather than deeply explored through nuanced character reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Most elements are integrated reasonably well, serving the central theme of eroding promises and containment. The story feels cohesive, but the inclusion of the dance element feels less organic than the others.</comment>
