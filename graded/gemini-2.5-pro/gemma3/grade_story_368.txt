<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'streetwise orphan' trait feels asserted rather than demonstrated; Elara's actions and rapid philosophical insight don't strongly reflect a 'hardened' background. Motivation is clear but generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but relies heavily on exposition about the brooch's function rather than showing it organically. The resolution is entirely internal insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, effectively supporting the theme of loss and memory. Sensory details are present, though the 'wrong sweetness' concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (brooch, patterns) and presents a clear theme, but the delivery borders on didacticism ("Elara realized..."). Impact relies more on the concept than deep character resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While avoiding major pitfalls, the story uses some clich√©d phrasing ("second skin," "harvest hope") and the language occasionally feels slightly overwrought ("unwritten calendar"). Lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated, but some feel less essential ("streetwise," "unwritten calendar"), suggesting the story is built around the prompts rather than flowing entirely organically. Competent but not exceptional synthesis.</comment>
