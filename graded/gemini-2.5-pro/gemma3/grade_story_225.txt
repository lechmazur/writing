<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'wayward apothecary' aspect feels superficial; his actions revolve around navigation and communication, not remedies. The 'unjustly fair' trait is stated but doesn't demonstrably influence the core romantic/treasonous plot arc. Motivation shifts believably from butterflies to Lyra, but the initial scientific drive lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from observation to clandestine communication and a risky decision. The Morse code method drives the central action effectively. Achieves a clear arc (setup, rising action, climax/decision) within the word limit, though the resolution is abrupt. Pacing is adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting ("brass and glass," "Iron Leviathan") is evoked well and contrasts nicely with the delicate butterflies. The "battered marvel" tone is consistent. The confined, neutral space enhances the secrecy and risk. Bioluminescence adds good visual detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes wonder and romantic tension. Imagery (butterflies, highlighter on map) is effective. The highlighter as a symbol of their secret language works well. The central conflict (love/connection vs. neutrality/duty) is clear. The metaphorical use of 'infect' adds a layer of meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the specific combination of elements (steampunk, butterflies, Morse code romance) offers some novelty, the prose occasionally dips into familiar phrasing ("swirling bioluminescence," "fragile neutrality"). The romance arc itself follows a somewhat predictable trajectory. The metaphorical 'infect' is a stronger, more original touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements cohesively, particularly the setting, method, and core concept. The highlighter pen's dual use is clever. The brevity works for this snapshot of burgeoning, risky love. It leaves the reader anticipating the rendezvous, achieving a sense of purpose despite the short form.</comment>
