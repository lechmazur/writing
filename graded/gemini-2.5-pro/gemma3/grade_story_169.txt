<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character concept is intriguing ("memory curator"), but the motivation ("forgotten songs") feels slightly abstract and not fully integrated with the specific method (reversed labels). The "weirdly static" attribute is stated rather than demonstrated effectively within the narrative action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear and achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit. The assigned action (choreograph) and method (reversed labels) drive the central event effectively. Pacing is well-managed for a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "recycling nebula" setting strongly supports the theme of forgotten memories. However, the "floating tea platform" feels arbitrary and less integrated, slightly jarring against the otherwise cohesive atmosphere of melancholy and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story successfully evokes a distinct mood and explores themes of memory, loss, and release through evocative concepts and metaphors ("memory curator," "lost melodies"). The central conflict resolves satisfyingly with the unearthed song, providing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept and character offer originality. However, some phrasing ("potent cocktail," "delicate re-tuning," "delicate choreography") borders on slightly ornate or self-consciously literary, slightly diminishing the sense of authentic voice or effortless craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates creativity in combining disparate elements into a mostly cohesive whole. Most elements serve the narrative, though some feel less essential than others (e.g., the tea platform). It leaves a lingering impression, achieving depth despite its brevity.</comment>
