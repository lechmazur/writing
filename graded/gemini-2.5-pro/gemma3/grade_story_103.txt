<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's internal motivation (penance, hushing regret) is clear and drives his actions (arranging items). However, the 'weatherbeaten knight' attribute feels somewhat superficial; the core struggle is internal and less dependent on his specific profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively portrays an internal arc of acceptance within the word limit. The action (appreciating/arranging items) logically leads to the resolution (understanding/peace). Pacing is well-managed for a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting and mirrored reflection timeframe are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a potent atmosphere of isolation and introspection that strongly supports the theme of regret and impossible choices. Sensory details enhance the mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (items, lighthouse, knocker) creates thematic depth regarding acceptance and the weight of choice. The story effectively evokes melancholy and contemplation, achieving significant impact through its craft despite minor instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("joyful agony").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept and its execution through symbolism feel original. While avoiding major clich√©s, some phrasing ("solidified regret," "joyful agony") borders on the ornate or overly explicit, slightly diminishing the nuance of emotion which is otherwise well-handled through action and symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The assigned elements are woven together cohesively, serving the central theme of accepting past choices rather than feeling forced. The story achieves a sense of completeness and leaves a lingering melancholic resonance, demonstrating creative integration within the constraints.</comment>
