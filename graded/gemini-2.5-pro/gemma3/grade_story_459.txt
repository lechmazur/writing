<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is mentioned once and never demonstrated or integrated into Arthur's actions or internal thoughts, feeling entirely superfluous. His motivation (liberation) is stated but feels somewhat intellectualized until the climax; the connection between his job and his ghost-seeing/seeking feels tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a discernible arc (observation, investigation via 'dissection', realization, resolution) effectively within the word limit. The 'dissect' action serves as a reasonable, if metaphorical, driver for the central part. The pacing is adequate, achieving a sense of completeness despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting provides a unique, effective atmosphere of hushed fragility that contrasts nicely with the character's internal 'dissonance'. The connection between the transient sand art and the ephemeral ghosts works well thematically. Sensory details related to silence and the brittle crown are present, enhancing the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (crown, decay) effectively to explore themes of grief, letting go, and acceptance. The central conflict is internal (Arthur's struggle) mirrored externally (ghost's entrapment), resolved quietly. However, the emotional impact relies heavily on stating the character's realization rather than fully showing the internal process leading up to it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements (elevator tech, sandcastles, ghosts) offers some originality. The prose is generally clear and avoids clich√©, but lacks a truly distinctive voice or style. The emotional resolution feels slightly too neat and follows a somewhat predictable therapeutic arc ('acknowledging' leads to release).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story manages to weave most assigned elements together, though some (technician job, clumsiness) feel poorly integrated or tacked on. The core narrative around the ghost, the crown, and the character's motivation holds together, but the piece doesn't quite transcend the sum of its parts to achieve exceptional resonance or depth.</comment>
