<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The apprentice character feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond the 'lost' archetype; their internal shift is believable but lacks deep nuance or a truly distinctive voice. Tiber is functional but leans heavily into the 'gruff mentor' trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the 'reverse-engineer' concept metaphorically to drive the internal arc towards self-acceptance. However, the resolution feels slightly predictable and perhaps too neatly achieved within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'interstellar orchard ship' setting is evocative and thematically relevant, but the atmosphere could be intensified with richer, more specific sensory details beyond the visual. The connection between setting and action is competent but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (nest, phone, pruning) to explore its theme of self-acceptance. It achieves a contemplative impact, but lacks a truly sharp edge or profound emotional resonance required for the highest tier. The craft is solid, but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s or obvious AI tells, the narrative follows a familiar 'finding wisdom' trajectory. The prose is clean but lacks a truly unique style or voice. Metaphors are functional rather than strikingly original. Emotion is conveyed more through statement and reflection than visceral showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The elements are integrated reasonably well, serving the central theme. The story feels cohesive and the length appropriate for the focused internal journey. However, it doesn't quite transcend its components to achieve exceptional depth or originality.</comment>
