<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation (guilt, seeking release) is clear but heavily stated rather than shown; the 'reservedly bold' attribute is asserted but demonstrated minimally. Character voice lacks true distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a standard 'seek information > get lead > pursue lead' structure. Tiber's exposition feels convenient. Achieves a basic setup arc but lacks narrative surprise or complexity within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The initial repair shop setting effectively establishes atmosphere with sensory details, but the wider world remains vague. The rosebush timeframe feels somewhat imposed for symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Craft is competent but relies on familiar imagery ("phantom weight") and telling emotions ("guilt," "regret"). Dialogue is purely functional. Lacks significant subtext or evocative 'showing'.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre tropes (guilty warrior, quest item, info broker) without fresh subversion. Language is clean but lacks a unique style. Feels predictable and somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story incorporates the required elements adequately, but their integration feels somewhat mechanical, as if constructed to fit prompts rather than flowing organically from a core idea.</comment>
