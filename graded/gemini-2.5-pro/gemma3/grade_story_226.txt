<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation (collecting lullabies from grief) is clear but feels stated rather than deeply inhabited. The 'gloomy orchardist' background provides flavour and material for the boxes but feels somewhat disconnected from the core sci-fi/spectral pursuit; its integration is superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc driven by the 'contain' action, but the 'black-market transaction' method is mentioned cursorily, weakening the setup. The narrative achieves completeness but lacks significant tension or complexity beyond the inherent fragility of the resonance; it feels somewhat slight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The Resonance Testing Facility setting provides necessary contrast and function, but lacks vivid, immersive detail. The timeframe 'hush where past meets prophecy' is evocative but too abstract to contribute meaningfully. The atmosphere supports the tone but the world feels thin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (boxes, lullabies as seeds) and evokes a melancholic mood. However, some phrasing ("apples tasted of regret," "grief too vast for tears") borders on overly literary or purple prose. The theme of preservation is present but lacks profound exploration within the scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept blends genres uniquely, avoiding major clich√©s. However, the prose sometimes defaults to familiar melancholic phrasing ("encroaching silence"). The potentially fascinating 'genuinely artificial' detail is introduced and then immediately dismissed by the protagonist, feeling like a missed opportunity rather than nuanced characterisation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion, but the assigned elements don't feel seamlessly fused; the orchardist aspect, in particular, feels less integral than others. While the brevity suits the focused action, the overall piece lacks the depth and polish required for the highest tier of publication.</comment>
