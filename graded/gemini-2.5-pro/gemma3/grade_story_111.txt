<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (wrestle dream) and attribute (intuitive) are established but feel somewhat archetypal; the internal shift is believable but lacks a deeply unique voice or profound exploration beyond the stated concepts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The internal plot arc (despair to acceptance) is clear and coherent within the word limit, but relies heavily on internal realization with minimal external action; the pebble-reading method effectively triggers the climax, though the overall structure feels slightly neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The unique setting (secret dog park) creates a strong, evocative atmosphere ("wet concrete," "phantom barks") that effectively supports the themes of forgottenness and hidden searching; sensory details are well-employed, though the 'dog park' aspect itself isn't deeply integrated beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ribbon, rings) and a clear thematic message about acceptance elevate the piece; however, the emotional impact of "exultant grief" feels somewhat intellectualized, and the overall craft, while competent, doesn't quite reach exceptional memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s and AI tells, presenting a relatively fresh combination of elements (alchemist, dog park, ribbon); however, some phrasing feels familiar, and the narrative lacks a truly distinctive authorial stamp or surprising subversion needed for top-tier originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The assigned elements are integrated cohesively, serving the central theme of transforming grief; the brevity feels appropriate for the focused internal shift, but the story doesn't fully transcend the feeling of being a well-executed response to constraints into something undeniably vital.</comment>
