<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and drives his actions, but the 'oddly typical' attribute feels superficial and underdeveloped, not significantly impacting his personality or method. His internal journey is believable, but his 'voice' is indistinct due to the third-person narration lacking unique flavour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear internal arc (setup, visualization, realization, resolution) effectively within the word limit. The action 'visualize' drives this internal progression logically. Pacing is well-managed, delivering a sense of completeness despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'strange attractor laboratory' setting provides intriguing atmosphere, but its specific relevance to Tiber's method (beyond generic 'residue') isn't fully exploited. The 'between shifting powers' timeframe adds ambiguity but lacks concrete impact. The 'rustic refinement' tone feels somewhat imposed rather than organically arising from the world or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses the central symbolism of currency to explore the theme of sacrifice and legacy, prompting reflection. The internal conflict is clear and resolved satisfyingly. While showing is generally preferred, some emotional beats are slightly told ("felt a pang"). The craft is competent, creating a thoughtful piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept and combination of elements offer originality. The prose avoids obvious AI pitfalls like repetitive phrasing or illogical jumps. However, the emotional nuance, while present, sometimes relies on stating feelings, and certain assigned elements ('oddly typical', 'rustic refinement') feel slightly formulaic or externally imposed rather than seamlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive narrative exploring a clear theme. The brief length feels appropriate for the focused internal journey. While generally strong, the full potential of the unique setting ('strange attractor lab') isn't realized, and a couple of elements feel less organic, slightly hindering its claim to flawless execution.</comment>
