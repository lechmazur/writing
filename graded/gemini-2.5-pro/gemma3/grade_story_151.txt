<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character's core descriptor, "awed astronomer," feels weakly integrated; his actions center on snowflakes and frequencies, not celestial awe. Motivation is stated but lacks nuanced exploration beyond remembering the 'shape' of longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from premise to action to hint of consequence, but the central method (translating snowflake patterns via veil/circuitry) feels abstract and underdeveloped. The arc is present but the resolution is minimal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked through the setting and tone ("crystal shadows"). However, the disparate elements (lighthouse, orchard, ice, idol) feel slightly artificially assembled rather than seamlessly interwoven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (veil, idol, snowflakes) is potent and the concept is thought-provoking. However, the story leans towards telling the theme and moral dilemma rather than fully embodying them through nuanced character experience or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept and combination of elements are original. However, some phrasing ("rationally organic," "quietude settling") borders on mannered, and the handling of emotion remains somewhat intellectualized rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite disparate elements, but the integration isn't flawless; the seams, particularly around the character descriptor, are visible. It feels more like a skillful execution of constraints than an organically inevitable narrative.</comment>
