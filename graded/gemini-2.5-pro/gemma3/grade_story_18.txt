<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear, but his pivotal realization feels abrupt, lacking sufficient internal processing. Wren serves primarily as a catalyst; her character and the "tragically joyful" attribute feel underdeveloped and somewhat imposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc efficiently, but the central revelation hinges on a sudden leap in logic triggered by the object, feeling convenient rather than earned. The pacing rushes the climax and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting provides a solid, atmospheric backdrop that contrasts effectively with the psychic elements. However, the assigned "gloomy cheerfulness" tone is not strongly established or consistently maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Uses symbolism effectively (statue, hair tie, gears), but relies on telling the nature of the Council's deceit rather than showing it unfold. The ending feels abrupt, and the final "tragically joyful mirror" line is heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept (grief-petrified telepath) offers originality, but the resolution relies on the somewhat common trope of the innocent catalyst. Tiber's deductive leap feels more like plot necessity than nuanced character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements competently, creating a cohesive narrative within the constraints. However, certain elements (calligraphy method, tone) feel less organic, suggesting the constraints sometimes dictated the story rather than serving it.</comment>
