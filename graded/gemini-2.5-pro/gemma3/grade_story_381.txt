<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'hushed necromancer' attribute feels largely superficial; his actions revolve around sonic mapping, not necromancy. The motivation shifts acceptably from mapping to understanding, but the 'shared love for old movies' recruitment method feels underdeveloped and slightly incongruous. Tiber's voice is described but lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from mapping to discovery within the word limit, achieving a mini-arc. The interpretation of 'dominate' as intellectual mastery is effective. However, the coherence suffers slightly from the underdeveloped 'old movies' method, which feels less integrated than the sonic mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The 'crystalline cave' setting is evoked adequately, and the 'between sets' timeframe adds a unique constraint. The 'futuristic nostalgia' tone is present but not deeply woven into the atmosphere; it feels more like a label than a fully realized mood. Sensory details are functional but lack exceptional vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth with the 'sound of resolve' concept, linking it to character and discovery. Dialogue is purposeful but not particularly memorable. The central conflict (understanding the cave) is clear, but the emotional impact relies more on stated feelings ('surge of something akin to hope') than subtle showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements is somewhat original, but the execution leans towards familiar tropes (mysterious cave, wise old mentor figure). The necromancer aspect feels like a generic fantasy label without unique exploration. Phrases like 'eyes wide with wonder' are clich√©. The connection drawn between Bogart and the cave's 'resolve' feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements; the necromancy and old movie aspects feel less essential than the core mapping plot. While the brief length works for the contained discovery, the disparate elements aren't woven together seamlessly enough to feel entirely organic or achieve profound depth.</comment>
