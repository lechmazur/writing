<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is specific and embodied, particularly the contradiction of her “quietly talented hands” now freezing from trauma. However, Mrs. Voss functions more as a thematic device than a fully drawn character; her dialogue, while kind, leans into archetypal wisdom (“Your talent isn’t just in your hands… It’s in your resilience”) that feels slightly too neat. Lila's final realization, "I want to anchor optimism in realism," is a diagnostic label that slightly undermines the earned emotion preceding it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory details and memory fragments rather than external plot turns. The closure is a strong, on-page Conceptual Repricing where Lila reframes the "pearl of stillness" from an escape to a lens. The cost—accepting a world that is both "terrible and tender"—is legible and gives the ending its weight, fulfilling the requirements for a powerful internal arc at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and indispensable. The arboretum, with its "wind-twisted pines and salt-bleached roses," is not just a backdrop but an active agent in Lila's healing. The specific, weathered stone bench becomes a tool that constrains her choice and enables her somatic work, directly charging the final image of groundedness. This integration of environment and action is what elevates the story beyond simple description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central stake—Lila’s ability to find peace amidst trauma—is clear and consistently tested. The conflict escalates effectively when an external trigger (the rattling gate) forces an internal crisis, demonstrating the fragility of her attempt at stillness. Mrs. Voss's intervention provides a crucial counter-pressure that allows for a re-evaluation of tactics, leading to a resolution earned through Lila's own agency and change in perspective, with the cost being the acceptance of a complex reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of integrating trauma is potent and evolves intelligently through the central metaphor. However, its delivery is hampered by moments of over-explicitness. Lila's line, “I want to anchor optimism in realism,” and Mrs. Voss’s explanation, “That’s why you anchor it in realism,” function as thematic summaries. This direct statement in the final third dilutes the subtext and replaces resonant imagery with a thesis, incurring a thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's point of view is rendered with a distinct, lyrical voice that effectively modulates with her emotional state, creating a strong perceptual signature. The prose is controlled and purposeful. The primary weakness is in the dialogue, where Mrs. Voss's voice lacks the same specificity as Lila's interiority, occasionally sounding more like an authorial guide than a distinct character. This slight convergence detracts from an otherwise powerful narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is clean and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. A recurring weakness is the occasional drift into a clinical or therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "reset a fractured soul," "deliberate, somatic choice"). This diction, while thematically relevant, sometimes clashes with the more lyrical texture of the surrounding prose, creating moments of slight abstraction where concrete embodiment would be stronger.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story combines the familiar trope of a wise mentor and a trauma survivor with a refreshingly specific and contemporary premise (a drone strike wedding survivor). The use of somatic therapy as a narrative engine provides a fresh angle on the healing journey. While not radically innovative in structure, the story's power comes from its authentic synthesis of these elements and the emotional honesty of its quiet, earned resolution.</comment>
