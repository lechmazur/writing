<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's transformation is too rapid to be credible for an "uptight" personality, and the repeated "arms of steel" motivation is heavy-handed and awkward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a logical leap from a taste of lavender to a complex magical function, a moment of realization that feels told rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the greenhouse and gravestones creates a powerful, resonant atmosphere that is the story's greatest strength.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story's central emotional arc—a rigid character learning to feel—is a well-worn trope, and some phrases feel formulaic rather than genuinely stylized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The piece feels more like a skillful assembly of assigned parts than an organic narrative; its tidiness and explicitly stated themes prevent it from achieving true literary depth.</comment>
