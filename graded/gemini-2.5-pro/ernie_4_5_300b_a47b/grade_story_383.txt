<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The characters feel like archetypes serving a theme; the protagonist's profound change happens too rapidly to be fully credible, and the woman is more of a narrative device than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and coherent arc within the word count, but its structure relies on the predictable "wise stranger" trope, making the plot functional rather than innovative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, using specific, evocative sensory details to create a palpable and memorable sci-fi noir mood that perfectly supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The central symbolism of the 'arc' is skillfully executed, but the story's impact is severely undercut by the woman's dialogue, which states the theme so explicitly it feels like a lecture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the combination of sci-fi, noir, and existentialism feels fresh, the narrative's core relies on common character tropes and a therapeutic arc that is not subverted or reimagined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A cohesive and atmospheric piece, but its lack of psychological subtlety and reliance on on-the-nose thematic statements prevent it from reaching the level of flawless, publishable literary fiction.</comment>
