<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation to “protect vulnerable voices” is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the moment she first hears the pulse. However, the explicit labeling of her core concept as “incidental heroism” and her attribute as “persistently curious” reads like direct summary rather than fully embodied traits, slightly flattening the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The discovery of the photograph leads directly to the investigation, which culminates in a well-earned climax and a Decisive Change for the client. The closure, where the wife receives the message, provides a felt cost (her single tear) and lands with resonant finality, satisfying the rubric's requirements for an on-page resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail that establishes a potent atmosphere. The setting is not merely decorative; it functions as a labyrinth that Lila must navigate. Crucially, the hearing aid—a micro-setting/tool—is central to the plot, constrains her choices by defining how she can perceive the echo, and charges the final image with its farewell beep, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving a final message for a grieving loved one—is established immediately. The conflict tightens effectively when Lila realizes the pulse is unusually old, raising the difficulty and testing her competence. The resolution is earned directly through her agency, and the emotional cost is made visible in the wife's reaction, providing a clear price for the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken love finding a voice emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its themes near the end. Lines like “Sometimes love is too big for words. But it’s never too late to hear it,” and the self-reflection on “incidental heroism” function as thematic moralizing, which slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the strange environment through Lila’s professional focus. The dialogue, while brief, is functional, though slightly on-the-nose, which keeps the score from rising higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and generally clear, with strong opening imagery. The primary weakness is a tendency toward redundancy in the final paragraphs. The lines “She’d assured a vulnerable voice... all because she’d listened” and “She’d done what she came to do: protected a voice...” create a paraphrase loop that summarizes what was just shown, slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise strong ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core premise of a “contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh and compelling synthesis of detective and supernatural genres. The execution transforms this trope by focusing on the quiet, emotional stakes of grief rather than a larger mystery. The story feels particular to its character and world, creating a memorable emotional truth that elevates it beyond a simple ghost story.</comment>
