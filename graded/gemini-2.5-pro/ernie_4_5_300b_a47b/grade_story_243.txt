<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "jumpy" trait is well-demonstrated, but the "necromancer" aspect feels like a superficial label rather than a deeply integrated part of the character's abilities or worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length, successfully executing a full narrative arc from inciting incident to a thematically resonant resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "retro video game world" is the story's greatest strength; the atmosphere is immersive, consistent, and uses specific sensory details to make the setting integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong thematic impact with effective symbolism, but is held back by moments of functional, slightly clich√© prose ("cascade of glitching light") where sharper language was needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blending of necromancy with a digital world is fresh, but the narrative voice, while competent, lacks a distinctive style, and some descriptive phrases feel constructed rather than truly inspired.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates masterful cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a purposeful narrative. Its primary weakness is a prose style that is clear and effective but not yet elevated to a flawless, literary level.</comment>
