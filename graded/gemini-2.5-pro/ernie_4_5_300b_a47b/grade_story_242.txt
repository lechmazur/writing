<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but her transformation from neutral guardian to revolutionary is summarized rather than shown. The internal conflict feels asserted, not earned, making her arc logically sound but emotionally thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete narrative arc, which is commendable. However, the plot relies on convenience; the first person Zara tails provides the exact key she needs, and the subsequent revolution meets with simplistic, easily overcome opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength. The sensory details, particularly the olfactory magic of the herbs, create a unique and deeply immersive atmosphere that is perfectly intertwined with the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is strong, with potent symbolism and a memorable central theme. However, the dialogue sometimes serves as a direct mouthpiece for the theme ("Loyalty's a dried herb..."), sacrificing naturalism for aphoristic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept is exceptionally original, avoiding clich√© by dressing a familiar trope in a unique speculative skin. The story's main weakness in this area is the frictionless plot progression, which feels more like a logical algorithm than a messy, human struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A cohesive and inventive story where the assigned elements feel integral, not imposed. Its primary flaw, preventing it from reaching the highest tier, is a sacrifice of psychological depth and narrative friction for the sake of conceptual elegance and speed.</comment>
