<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and her competence is demonstrated through action (reassembling letters). The shift from "truth" to "survival" at the climax is earned by the escalation of stakes. However, the line “But Mara’s motivation wasn’t just truth—it was survival” is a moment of telling over showing that slightly flattens an otherwise solid internal progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Causal drive is executed flawlessly, with each discovery logically leading to the next beat. The closure is a Decisive Change (sealing the stillpoint) with a clear on-page cost (the mystery of Crane remains, the world is saved). The decoy diamond twist provides an effective tightening right before the final choice, making the structure exceptionally strong for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as both atmosphere and a primary driver of the plot. The central paradox of the thriving orchard in a radioactive wasteland is a fantastic hook. Environmental details, like the trees leaning toward the center, directly guide character action and charge the final image as they "unfurling like sighs," meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are signaled early and escalate perfectly from a missing person case to a world-threatening crisis. The climax presents a meaningful choice between two competing goods with a clear, felt cost. Mara's agency drives the resolution, and the pressure on her feels coherent and earned, culminating in a choice that is both difficult and inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of dangerous truths versus comfortable lies is well-integrated. The story’s ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by forcing the "truth excavator" to bury a part of the truth to ensure survival. The final two sentences ("Comfortable lies had no place here... some secrets are too dangerous to stay buried") verge on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise potent ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice—professional, observant, and grounded—is a perfect fit for the protagonist. The narrative distance is consistent, modulating appropriately with the rising tension. The prose signature is distinct and controlled, creating a sense of competence that makes Mara’s deductions credible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is clean, efficient, and often evocative, with strong opening and closing images. Sentence structure is varied, maintaining momentum throughout. There are minor instances of summary where showing would be stronger, particularly in the reveal of the two diamonds' purpose ("The flawed diamond had been a decoy...The true stillpoint required sacrifice"). Overall, however, the line-level craft is sharp and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While using familiar sci-fi and mystery tropes, the story synthesizes them into a fresh and compelling narrative. The concept of the "stillpoint" as a source of both fertility and entropy is an ingenious twist. The specific, grounded details of the investigation and the wasteland setting prevent the story from feeling generic, creating a memorable and self-contained world.</comment>
