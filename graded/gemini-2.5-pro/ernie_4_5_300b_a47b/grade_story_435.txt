<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a functional vessel for the plot, but lacks a distinct voice or convincing internal life; her motivation is delivered via exposition and accepted with a credulity that undermines the story's high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot mechanics are exceptionally coherent, providing a clear and complete narrative arc that is well-paced within the severe word constraint. Cause and effect are logical and effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength; the concept and setting are seamlessly integrated to create a specific, tangible, and evocative atmosphere that drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the central metaphor of calcified emotions is potent, the story's impact is intellectual rather than emotional. It 'tells' of high stakes and yearning but fails to make the reader 'feel' them through nuanced character experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, but the execution is fatally undermined by jarring, unnatural phrasing ("occasionally frequent") and a glaring technical error ("潮水"), which are immediate grounds for rejection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Despite a brilliant concept and stellar world-building, the story is unpublishable in its current state. Critical execution flaws and a superficial protagonist prevent it from meeting a professional standard, feeling more like a promising but deeply unpolished draft.</comment>
