<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The character concept is highly original, but her motivation is entirely external and her core attribute ("robustly delicate") is told to the reader, not shown. The fascinating "scapegoat" profession is quickly sidelined for a more generic "decoder" role, leaving her development feeling thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot is well-paced and contains a decent twist, but it feels overstuffed with concepts. The "last library card" detail is an un-fired Chekhov's gun, a significant loose thread. The story functions as a prologue, lacking a satisfying resolution and feeling incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength. The "Cloud City" setting is rendered with evocative, specific sensory details that create a tangible and compelling cyberpunk-noir atmosphere, which strongly supports the plot and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and the central theme of identity is intriguing. However, the narrative relies too heavily on telling key character traits rather than showing them, and the abrupt, unresolved ending limits the story's overall impact as a self-contained piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "professional scapegoat" is fresh, but the narrative quickly retreats into the safety of common cyberpunk tropes (shadowy syndicate, ancient secret). Phrases like "robustly delicate" feel slightly synthetic, as if reverse-engineered from a writing prompt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high craft in its prose and atmosphere, but it feels more like a well-executed assembly of assigned parts than an organic whole. The brevity is a clear limitation, not a choice, preventing the intriguing concepts from achieving the depth they require to be truly memorable.</comment>
