<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character is more of a symbolic archetype for the theme than a person with nuanced psychology. The "skewed vision" as both a literal and metaphorical trait is effective but lacks subtlety, and the supporting character, Marlow, is a one-dimensional skeptical foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is a clean, linear execution of a discovery narrative (clue -> investigation -> discovery -> resolution). While coherent and well-paced for the word count, it is predictable and lacks any significant setback, tension, or narrative surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere within the greenhouse is well-evoked, but the high-concept setting of a "temporal anomaly study center" feels underutilized and disconnected from the core plot, which is essentially archaeological. The sci-fi element is flavor rather than a functional part of the world's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The craft is undermined by its lack of subtlety. The story explicitly states its theme ("The past isn’t a ruin—it’s a seed," "mundane miracles… are just familiar things seen anew") multiple times, which feels like authorial intrusion rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on the well-worn trope of a lone visionary proving the skeptical establishment wrong. While the specific details are creative, the underlying structure and character dynamics are formulaic and offer no subversion of convention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is a very competent and cohesive assembly of its required parts, but it reads like a skillful exercise rather than a piece with deep artistic originality. Its primary weakness is being too neat; its themes and symbols are so perfectly aligned that it lacks the ambiguity and grit of top-tier fiction.</comment>
