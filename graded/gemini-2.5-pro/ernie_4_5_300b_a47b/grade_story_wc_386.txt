<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is clear, but his characterization lacks depth. There is no significant internal conflict; he pivots from his initial problem to a new, successful method without any dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse. The final choice feels emotionally correct but comes at no visible cost, making him more of a wise, detached medium than a protagonist engaged in a difficult crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight effectively through the three dream sequences. However, a major causal gap weakens the structure: the method of "analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" is introduced without any setup or explanation of its mechanics. This convenient, magical leap undermines the plot's integrity, making the subsequent revelations feel unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story excels in creating a potent atmosphere. The setting of the candle-lit glacier shrine is rendered with evocative, specific sensory details. The central object, the melted snow globe, is masterfully integrated, its meaning shifting within each dream and its final placement on the altar providing a powerful, resonant image that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the stakes deepen emotionally from a simple mystery to a profound resolution of grief, the conflict lacks friction. Kael faces no meaningful opposition or risk in his dream-walking; information is acquired too easily. The resolution is earned thematically but not dramatically, as the absence of a tangible cost or trade-off for the protagonist makes the final peace feel preordained and low-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of enduring connection is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the snow globe. However, the story leans into overt thematic statements, particularly in the resolution. Lines like "He had salvaged something pure from the wreckage...the fragile, enduring threads of connection" state the moral directly, replacing the resonant power of the final image with unnecessary explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The point of view is stable and the third-person limited narration maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story’s melancholic tone. The prose is controlled and clean, effectively filtering the supernatural events through Kael's calm, observant perspective. While not radically distinctive, the voice is highly competent and supports the narrative without flaw.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. The craft is generally high, though a few phrases border on cliché ("rustle of wind through frozen reeds"). The main weakness is the tendency to summarize theme in declarative sentences, but the line-level execution of the dream sequences is clear and evocative, carrying the story's emotional weight effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a wreck-diver ghost whisperer offers a fresh angle on a familiar trope, and subverting the vengeful ghost cliché is a strong choice. However, the ingenuity is hampered by the plot's reliance on a convenient, unexplained magical ability. The emotional resolution is moving, but the mechanical path to it feels safe and lacks the startling inevitability of a more rigorously constructed plot.</comment>
