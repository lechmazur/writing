<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence is well-established. The shift in her stance is visible in the final beat, moving from a reactive problem-solver to a proactive challenger ("Then I'll dam it"). Her interiority is concrete and goal-oriented, though it lacks significant internal contradiction, which keeps it from the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Causal lens through the main conflict. The closure is an effective Charged Poise, establishing the ongoing "game." However, the multiple time jumps in the final third (resolution, "weeks later," "one night") diffuse the focus slightly, making the structure feel more like a summary of events than a single, taut narrative shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is excellent and integral. The university radio station, with its "maze of cables and vintage equipment," provides the specific tools that constrain and enable the plot. The astronomical charts function as a key object that is used to diagnose the problem, enact the solution, and deliver the final threat, perfectly charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes—professional and societal—are established early and tested directly by Lila's actions. The escalation is clean, and her agency drives the resolution. The cost is legible: she has provoked a powerful, intelligent adversary, moving the conflict from impersonal to personal, which is powerfully confirmed by the final direct communication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story successfully develops its theme of order versus chaos through action rather than statement. The core conflict between harmony and dissonance is elegantly dramatized. The final image of the "chessboard" and Lila's hardening resolve provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central power struggle, beautifully repricing the stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Lila's focused, professional character. The prose has a clean, distinct texture that modulates well with the rising tension. The direct, non-gendered voice of the trickster at the end is an effective escalation in narrative technique.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is clear, concise, and carries strong momentum. Imagery like "wind chimes made of starlight" and a script that "shifted like smoke" is vivid and effective. While a few phrases lean toward cliché ("older than time," "cosmos was a chessboard"), the overall execution is clean, with high information density and no significant prose artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept is a fresh synthesis, grounding a cosmic-level conflict in the wonderfully specific and gritty setting of a university radio station. The use of subsonic harmony as the weapon against reality-warping dissonance is an ingenious and memorable mechanism. This transformation of familiar sci-fi tropes into something personal and tactile is the story's greatest strength.</comment>
