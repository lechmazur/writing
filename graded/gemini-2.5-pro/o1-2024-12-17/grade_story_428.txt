<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but the 'rarely authentic' attribute is repeatedly stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through nuanced action or internal thought; the ink blotter symbolism feels somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc, but the 'debase' action is internalised weakly, and the 'handshake' timeframe feels abruptly inserted and poorly integrated, disrupting coherence and pacing near the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is adequately evoked with some sensory details, but the connection between the Indian temple setting and the character's specific background/object feels superficial; the 'handshake' timeframe clashes tonally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on stated symbolism (ink blotter) and repeated thematic phrases ("banish doubt," "self-imposed chains") rather than subtle subtext; the central conflict is internal but lacks deep emotional resonance due to telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Noticeable repetition of key phrases ("daring caution," "banish doubt," "handshake") feels formulaic; while the combination of elements is somewhat unique, the execution leans on tropes (ancient temple secrets) and lacks fresh metaphorical language or truly nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to make the assigned elements feel entirely organic; particularly the timeframe feels forced, hindering overall cohesion and suggesting the constraints dictated the narrative rather than serving it seamlessly.</comment>
