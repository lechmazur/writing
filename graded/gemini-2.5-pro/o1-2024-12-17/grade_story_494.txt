<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character relies heavily on stated attributes ("arrogant," "doubtfully confident") rather than nuanced demonstration through action or internal monologue; motivation is clear but generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arc (seeking wisdom -> epiphany -> resolution) that feels formulaic; the resolution via the song/authorization is functional but slightly contrived and lacks strong tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is underdeveloped, relying on stated tone ("harsh tenderness") instead of evocative sensory detail; the setting is generic and doesn't significantly enhance the mood or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (tapestry) is overt and themes ("shackled potential") are explicitly stated, lacking subtlety; relies heavily on telling emotions rather than showing, limiting impact and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Language feels constructed and somewhat stilted, using repetitive or slightly unnatural phrasing ("doubtfully confident," "harsh tenderness"); relies on common tropes (arrogant warrior/wise master) without originality or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The story feels overtly constructed around the assigned elements rather than having them serve an organic narrative; lacks the depth, subtlety, and unique voice required for top-tier publication.</comment>
