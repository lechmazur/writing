<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but feels generic ("embodying values"); the 'groggy brewer' trait is superficial, and the assigned 'flippant solemnity' tone is asserted rather than convincingly demonstrated through voice or action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a basic arc, but the initiating trigger ('slightest discoloration') feels arbitrary and insignificant. The connection between the crypt quest and the external protest remains tenuous and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The graveyard setting is functional and atmospheric, but the 'lull in a protest' timeframe feels poorly integrated into the core narrative. Sensory details are adequate but not exceptionally evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (mirror, darkness) and thematic depth (inner vs. outer battles), but the execution is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The central conflict resolution feels somewhat abrupt and predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Significant repetition of key phrases ("flippant solemnity," "encroaching darkness," "initiate") and reliance on standard genre tropes without fresh perspective suggest formulaic writing. The 'uniquely generic' element feels entirely tacked on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements; several feel forced (brewer, discoloration, uniquely generic, protest lull), hindering narrative flow and organic development. It reads more like an exercise in element inclusion than a compelling, self-contained piece.</comment>
