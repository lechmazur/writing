<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional, with motivation rooted in a crucible of grief and scientific intellect. The interiority is specific and potent, particularly in how Amal translates emotional constants like "the scent of the crushed jasmine" into mathematical variables. The final shift from abstract hunt to targeted trajectory is a perfectly earned and chilling evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story uses a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens flawlessly. Pressure builds through the ticking clock and internal focus, culminating in a Charged Poise closure that is both a discovery and a reconfiguration of the character's purpose. The structure is tight, purposeful, and delivers a resonant, costly final state without a single wasted beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, contrasting the sterile observatory with the raw, chaotic grief it contains. The geode crystal is a masterclass in using a recurring object; it functions as a tangible link to the past, a focusing tool in the present, and a mirror for the terrible discovery at the end, directly charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a single, high-stakes goal under a clear time constraint, and the pressure escalates organically. The conflict is primarily an internal race against a mechanical deadline, which deepens powerfully with the discovery of the resonance. The cost is clear: Amal's grief is not resolved but weaponized, foreclosing any other path forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the fusion of quantum physics and personal loss. The central concept—"potential is a current, and it can be diverted"—is dramatized rather than stated, and the ending provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The piece resonates with complex ideas about grief, memory, and cosmic justice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and impeccably controlled, seamlessly blending the lexicon of theoretical physics with the visceral language of loss. The narrative maintains a tight psychic distance, giving the prose a sense of desperate, intellectual focus. Every sentence feels filtered through Amal's unique and specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is largely stellar, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, precise imagery. However, a significant line-level artifact—the sentence fragment "[ intricately tangible a force as gravity."—breaks the flow and clarity at a key descriptive moment. While the surrounding craft is superb, this unforced error prevents a near-perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise is brilliantly original, transforming a grief narrative into a high-concept cosmic mystery. The synthesis of perturbation theory, quantum mechanics, and the emotional weight of loss feels fresh and fully realized. The story takes a significant conceptual risk and executes it with a confidence that makes the outcome feel inevitable.</comment>
