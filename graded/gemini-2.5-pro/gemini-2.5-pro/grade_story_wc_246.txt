<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivation is stark and all-consuming, and his internal conflict between the desire to erase his past and the need to integrate it is dramatized effectively. The character arc from being "hunched over the console in a knot of guilt" to the deliberate act of unbending is an excellent example of embodied emotion driving the resolution. The final choice feels earned, foreclosing the path of revision with the felt cost of permanent loss, which he accepts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from the inciting incident (the signal's appearance) to the resolution. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is executed perfectly on the page; Kaelen renounces his goal of editing the past and accepts its consequences, a choice with a clear and poignant cost. The structure is tight and efficient, with every element serving the final, resonant reconfiguration of Kaelen's relationship with his failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is both the plot's engine and a reflection of the character's internal state. The gravitational anomaly is a brilliant conceit that enables the conflict, while the pen—a recurring micro-setting object—acts as a powerful emotional anchor. The pen's journey from a "useless monument to his failure" to a "testament to the man he had become" is masterful, directly charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stakes are established immediately and are immense: the weight of thousands of lives lost. The conflict escalates beautifully as Kaelen’s attempts to fix the past reveal that every potential solution creates a new disaster. This deepens the central problem, shifting it from a technical challenge to a philosophical one. The resolution is an act of protagonist agency—a renunciation—with the unmistakable cost of leaving the tragedy intact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning through acceptance rather than erasure is woven seamlessly into the narrative. It emerges entirely from Kaelen’s actions and internal struggle, resisting any easy moralizing. The final image of the pen, recontextualized, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how to live with catastrophic failure. The story's conclusion is not a solution, but a profound and earned understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, creating a voice that is both professionally competent and deeply melancholic. The narrative stance is consistent, and the prose has a distinct, contemplative rhythm that modulates effectively during the frantic "dance" with the data stream. The perceptual signature is strong; we see the universe through the specific lens of a man defined by a single, colossal mistake.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is clean, confident, and possesses a high information density. Sentences like "He was a celestial signal interpreter, a title both grand and modest for a man who spent his cycles listening to the static between stars" establish character, setting, and tone with remarkable efficiency. There are no notable loops or scaffolding, and the language maintains its clarity and propulsion through the story’s emotional climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>While the "editing the past" trope is familiar, the story's ingenuity lies in its resolution. The choice not to erase the mistake but to add a "footnote"—a warning and a eulogy—is a powerful and original subversion. This transforms a standard sci-fi plot into a poignant meditation on grief, memory, and the value of hard-won wisdom, feeling both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
