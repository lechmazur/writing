<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the central discovery feels too convenient, lacking deeper struggle or subtlety expected at the highest level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept blends elements with some originality, but execution leans on familiar tropes (e.g., "phantom riders nodding") and some predictable phrasing, diluting its freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, yet the swift, convenient resolution lessens its overall depth and impact, making it fall short of flawless execution for a top literary market.</comment>
