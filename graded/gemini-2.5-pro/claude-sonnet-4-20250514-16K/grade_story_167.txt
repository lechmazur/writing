<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character arc feels somewhat expedited; the "uncommonly typical" label is stated rather than fully embodied through nuanced internal conflict leading to her rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While coherent, the plot relies on a slightly indirect connection between the specified "method" (echo/well) and the "action" (contaminate); the overall arc is functional but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting elements are functional and provide effective contrast, but the "earthbound flight" tone serves more as a powerful specific image rather than a pervasive atmospheric quality throughout the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a clear emotional response and presents a strong theme, but some central literary devices and metaphors, while effective, lean towards the familiar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to transcend familiar tropes (rebel vs. oppressive system), and the direct repetition of the phrase "uncommonly typical" is a noticeable stylistic weakness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its assigned elements adequately and constructs a complete narrative, but it doesn't achieve the exceptional originality or profound depth required for the highest literary echelon.</comment>
