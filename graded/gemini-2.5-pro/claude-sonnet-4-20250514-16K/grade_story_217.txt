<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strength: Maya's resourcefulness and deep connection to the park are well-established, contrasting with her "dismissed" status. Weakness: The "rebel/delinquent" aspect feels somewhat like an applied label rather than a deeply integrated character trait driving her primary, more constructive actions; her core motivation is also partly told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves a complete and satisfying arc with a clear inciting incident (the call) within the word limit. Weakness: The assigned "method" (shared love for cuisine) has a tenuous and unconvincing causal link to the "action" (intensify), feeling more like coincidental scene-setting than a direct plot mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: The haunted park setting is vividly rendered with effective sensory details ("autumn mist," "dusty floor"), creating a strong, integral atmosphere that perfectly supports the narrative's mood and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Effective use of symbolism (knife as survival tool evolving to creative instrument) and a thematically resonant, hopeful ending. Weakness: Some key internal states and character motivations (e.g., "sadly joyful ache," "motivation to prime...heart for wonder") are explicitly stated, rather than consistently shown through action or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: The specific combination of a technically skilled protagonist reviving a derelict haunted house offers a reasonably fresh angle on familiar underdog narratives. Weakness: Relies on some common tropes (e.g., the "misunderstood delinquent with hidden talents/heart of gold") without significant subversion, making parts of the setup feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves a poignant mood and clear thematic message about adaptation and the value of the overlooked within a concise, well-paced narrative. Weakness: The "shared love for cuisine" element feels the most artificially imposed and least organically integrated into the plot's core mechanics, slightly hindering overall cohesiveness at the highest standard.</comment>
