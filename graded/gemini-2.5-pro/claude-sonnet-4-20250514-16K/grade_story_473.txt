<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Attribute and motivation are clear, but the "unwanted leadership" theme feels more asserted than deeply, viscerally explored through her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A coherent vignette, yet the plot is minimal; the central action serves primarily as a thematic metaphor rather than driving significant narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original and evocative setting, though the scale of "miles of solar panels" slightly strains full immersion within an "urban orchard" concept without further grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor and subtext, but the primary antagonist ("expectations of fate") remains abstract, somewhat muting immediate narrative tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Commendably original combination of elements, though a minor repetitive phrasing ("bittersweet grit") slightly mars an otherwise fresh voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Impressive integration of elements into a cohesive whole, but the story's quiet, internal conflict might lack the broader dramatic impact sought by top-tier publications.</comment>
