<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong core motivation (guilt/redemption); however, the "duelist" aspect is underutilized in her present problem-solving, and "cheerless" is somewhat static after the introduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Excellent plot arc mirroring the internal journey with clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the description of data *corruption* as "precisely innovative" is a minor conceptual snag.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The decaying spaceport and server rooms create a potent atmosphere; however, the "maggoty wooden chest" for data cores introduces a significant, jarring incongruity within the sci-fi setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central metaphor of recipe restoration as a path to healing is highly effective and original; some key internal realizations are stated more than fully dramatized within the concise narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>High conceptual originality in blending sci-fi with a personal redemption arc; however, the phrase "precisely innovative" for decay and the "maggoty chest" feel slightly forced or incongruous, hinting at external constraints rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is largely cohesive and emotionally resonant with a strong central symbol; minor incongruities (e.g., "maggoty chest," the "precisely innovative" nature of corruption) prevent it from achieving flawless execution for the highest tier of publication.</comment>
