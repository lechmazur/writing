<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's "shaky" aspect and guilt are well-portrayed, but the "reckless" part of the "carefully reckless" attribute feels more asserted about his past than fully demonstrated in the tender, desperate nature of this specific search; his motivation for peace is clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and coherence within the word limit, effectively driven by the "searching" concept; however, the "finalize" action feels back-loaded, primarily resolving the plot rather than driving its main body.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral setting and "echoing hour" timeframe create a potent, resonant atmosphere that strongly supports the story's themes and Marcus's internal state; sensory details are generally good, particularly visual and olfactory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through impactful symbolism (amber, painting) and evocative imagery, achieving emotional resonance; however, the direct repetition of the phrase "carefully reckless" feels slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative generally avoids formulaic pitfalls, but the repetition of "carefully reckless" and "echoing hour," alongside a somewhat clich√©d phrase like "golden time," slightly detracts from complete originality and seamlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates most elements to serve a poignant narrative of redemption, and the brief length feels deliberate; the slight over-emphasis on the assigned attribute "carefully reckless" is the main point that feels less than perfectly organic.</comment>
