<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's core motivation is clear, but the "modestly extravagant" attribute feels under-explored, and the rapid resolution of deep-seated guilt strains credulity for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves a complete arc, but the "organize via seesaw echo" method is conceptually loose, and the resolution feels condensed for the established 15-year trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the overly neat and swift resolution of profound, long-standing guilt lessens the story's potential depth and mature resonance.</comment>
