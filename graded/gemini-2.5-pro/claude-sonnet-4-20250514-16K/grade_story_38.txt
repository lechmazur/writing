<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "poet" attribute feels under-utilised and largely disconnected from her core actions or worldview; the shift to her ultimate motivation is clear but somewhat abrupt for profound depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on a somewhat convenient overheard confession; the arc is complete but the inciting incident feels less than organically derived for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "empty abundance" tone and haunted attic setting are effectively established and thematically resonant, though overall sensory immersion could be more uniquely vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Exhibits strong thematic clarity and effective symbolism (plants), but leans on direct exposition for crucial backstory (grandmother's intent) rather than fully showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative blends intriguing botanical and supernatural elements but utilizes a common trope (overheard confession) and some phrasing feels self-consciously literary rather than seamlessly authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are generally woven into a cohesive narrative with a clear purpose, but the reliance on a convenient plot catalyst slightly diminishes its overall structural elegance for top-tier publication.</comment>
