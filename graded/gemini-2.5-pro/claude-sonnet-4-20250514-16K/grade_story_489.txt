<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "aggressively kind" spirit is compelling and consistently motivated; the dancer, however, remains somewhat archetypal and less developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc driven by the 'fling' action, but the central conflict (dropped whistle) and its resolution are somewhat convenient and lack deep complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and immediate timeframe create a strong, supportive atmosphere, though it leans on some conventional imagery for such settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance and uses imagery effectively, but some prose feels self-consciously literary, and the ending's explicit "knowing" weakens its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "aggressively kind" attribute offers a fresh character angle, but the overall narrative framework and some metaphors ("waves of time," "fog of forgetting") are quite conventional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated into a poignant vignette; however, it lacks the striking originality or profound narrative depth expected for flawless, top-tier publication.</comment>
