<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus is well-realized with a consistent, unique voice and motivation; Elena's swift cooperation is slightly convenient but acceptable for the story's length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear, efficient plot arc with good pacing; the "following cats" method, while charmingly fitting the world's quirks, borders on overly convenient for an otherwise grounded sci-fi investigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative and original setting that is deeply integrated with the plot and characters; strong sensory details create an immersive atmosphere around the black hole resort.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thought-provoking theme and effective literary devices (notably the "frosted glass" simile); however, the concluding thematic statement is overly explicit for truly top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of spacetime weaving and Marcus's "poetically bland" perspective offer significant originality; the writing avoids common AI pitfalls and exhibits a distinct narrative style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving a clear thematic purpose; the story achieves a commendable sense of completeness and thoughtful depth within its concise form.</comment>
