<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The foundational conflict is established, but the 'rarely authentic' attribute feels underdeveloped in its broader implications, and the profound internal shift occurs with a narrative swiftness that lessens its psychological impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A discernible arc is achieved, yet the assigned 'debase' action functions more as an internal surrender than an overt plot driver, and 'studying constellations' is a rectified past error rather than an active method in the pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of setting creates a strong atmosphere, well-suited to the thematic core; however, the 'daring caution' tone describes a character's fleeting approach rather than defining the overall narrative mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story wields symbolism effectively, particularly the blotter and constellations, though the central epiphany relies on a somewhat familiar metaphor ('ice breaking'), and its arrival feels narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the central character concept offers a degree of freshness, the narrative leans on a standard 'wise sage' archetype and a clich√©d 'dissolving in mist' exit, diminishing its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements into a thematically cohesive whole, but the protagonist's significant transformation happens with an allegorical rapidity that prioritizes message over deeply earned character change.</comment>
