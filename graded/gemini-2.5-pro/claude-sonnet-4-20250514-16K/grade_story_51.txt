<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "rationally subjective" attribute is superficially applied; Sarah's characterization sacrifices psychological realism for thematic expediency, making her reaction to Marcus feel contrived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot's progression relies on convenient character reactions (notably Sarah's) and a somewhat implausible method ("accidental meetings" over months without issue), weakening the earned nature of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The primary museum setting lacks vivid, unique characterization beyond generic descriptions; the symbolic "static electricity garden" feels more like an illustrative add-on than an organically integrated environmental element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thematic points, particularly Sarah’s dialogue on resilience, are delivered too directly, diminishing subtlety and resembling an aphorism rather than organic character expression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story relies on an idealized victim response and familiar tropes of repentance without significant subversion; some descriptive phrases lack freshness and border on cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Competent construction is undermined by a lack of deep psychological realism in key interactions and a tendency towards thematic over-explicitness, preventing it from reaching exceptional literary quality.</comment>
