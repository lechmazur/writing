<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is functional and the climax impactful, but the inciting event for this climax (Drifter's sudden shift to an unmapped phenomenon) feels more narratively convenient than organically emergent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is generally well-evoked, yet certain descriptive choices ("intangibly tangible") border on being overly stylized, slightly detracting from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance and uses symbolism effectively, but key emotional payoffs occasionally lean on commonplace sci-fi similes ("cosmic radiation"), missing opportunities for fresher imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the central concept of evolving musical interspecies communication is strikingly original, some ancillary descriptions of alien beings and phenomena ("tendril of light") tread familiar genre paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative is commendably cohesive and emotionally engaging for its brevity, yet minor plot conveniences and some predictable descriptive language prevent it from achieving the "flawless" standard required for the most competitive publications.</comment>
