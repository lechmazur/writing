<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character is functional and motivation clear, but relies on an archetypal foundation and a somewhat formulaic epiphany; "grudgingly sweet" is more a late-stage thematic label than a consistently demonstrated personality trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Coherent internal plot, but the catalytic appearance of symbolic items feels overly convenient as a plot device, and the stated action ("appreciate") is a resolved state rather than an initial driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting and atmosphere (lighthouse, mirror) strongly support the story's themes, with effective sensory details grounding the knight's introspection; this is a notable strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and thematic depth, yet the central revelation, while emotionally resonant, arrives with a neatness that slightly undercuts the earned weight of its profound implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leverages established tropes (e.g., knight's regret, mirror as portal) without significant subversion; some phrasing ("grudgingly sweet," "joyful agony") borders on self-conscious or slightly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Achieves strong thematic cohesion and emotional resonance, but its structural familiarity and somewhat elevated prose, while fitting, do not achieve the striking originality or flawlessness demanded for the highest tier.</comment>
