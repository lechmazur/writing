<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's established "uptight" nature makes the climactic "bellow" feel somewhat abrupt, even as an emotional release; the internal scaffolding for such an overt display could be more subtly developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The crucial plot link—how Cornelius's "adhesive analysis" directly reveals "copper traces infused with human tears"—is asserted by the witch rather than clearly stemming from his scientific method, making it a narrative convenience for the mystical turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is superbly realized, with rich sensory details and symbolic weight (greenhouse, gravestones) deeply interwoven with the story's thematic and emotional core, significantly enhancing the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story employs powerful central symbolism (the soul-illuminating bulb) and generally evocative language, creating a strong impact, though some motivational phrasing like "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a Tesla prototype light bulb intended to illuminate souls, with its activation linked to an adhesive infused with human tears—is genuinely inventive and refreshingly original, skillfully blending science and mysticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong thematic and emotional arc with impressive concision, creatively integrating its assigned elements, despite a minor logical stretch in how the scientific analysis leads to the mystical revelation.</comment>
