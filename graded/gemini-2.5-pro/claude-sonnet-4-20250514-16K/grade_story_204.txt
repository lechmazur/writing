<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya is distinct and her attribute ("unusually usual") fits, but the assigned motivation ("overcome prejudice") feels more like a concluded backstory than an active, immediate driver within this specific scene of realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot provides a clear arc via the pivotal "chance encounter," but this central mechanism feels somewhat convenient; "decay" serves as theme, not a plot-driving action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building; the "abandoned spaceport hangar" and "ancient novelty" tone are vividly realized with strong sensory details, forming a key strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Achieves good emotional resonance and thematic clarity with effective symbolism, though the protagonist's central epiphany arrives with a degree of predictability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core premise is original and the writing avoids obvious AI tells, but it relies on the familiar trope of a "wise elder's validation" and some clich√©d phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with well-integrated elements for its vignette style, but the sentimental and somewhat facile resolution of the epiphany might lack the challenging depth expected at the highest tier.</comment>
