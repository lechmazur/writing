<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Attribute 'personally impersonal' feels somewhat asserted; the character's internal shift to seeking 'pure grace' could be more deeply woven and less explicitly stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mechanism of understanding complex bee communication (coordinates, Scripture) via the twist tie feels underdeveloped; the 'seventeen seconds' detail is jarringly specific, breaking the mystical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional strength: the central image of the cathedral orchard is uniquely vivid, and the atmosphere is palpably, consistently rendered, forming the story's most compelling aspect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Powerful core imagery and resonant theme of hidden wonders, but explicit details in the climax ('Scripture,' 'seventeen seconds') slightly diminish its elegantly built mystical impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly original premise and striking central metaphor; however, some descriptive phrases for character traits ('personally impersonal', 'cautious bravery') feel slightly imposed rather than fully emergent from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imaginative and memorable with a strong atmosphere; minor executional choices, particularly around the climax's specificity and character trait exposition, slightly detract from overall flawlessness for top-tier publication.</comment>
