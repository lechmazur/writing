<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "softly militant" attribute is effectively portrayed through her actions; however, the primary motivation to "dissect the architecture of cosmic balance" feels somewhat intellectually superimposed, not fully organically arising from the profound grief of losing her daughter within the story's brief scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear reflective arc and sense of completeness. The action "coerce" drives her current efforts, while the "scouring attics" method serves as crucial but past foundational setup rather than an active plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop setting and the transformed sky are rendered with evocative sensory details, creating a strong, consistent atmosphere of "reluctant awe" that supports the character's actions and the story's themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through its rich use of imagery, metaphor, and symbolism, effectively conveying themes of resilience and the cyclical nature of existence; the ending feels purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, the prose frequently borders on the overly ornate ("impossible auroras wrote equations," "delicate mathematics of renewal"), and the character's swift progression from profound grief to detached cosmic analysis feels more thematically convenient than deeply authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves its assigned elements into an ambitious narrative, but the highly stylized, self-consciously literary prose and the character's somewhat unconvincing intellectual leap detract from achieving flawless, immediate publishability for a top-tier venue.</comment>
