<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation stemming from the promise to his sister is clear and compelling, and his "blunt heretic" nature is adequately portrayed. However, the assigned attribute "enthusiastically cautious" feels somewhat superficially applied rather than deeply woven into his actions or internal monologue; "anxious elation" (the tone) captures his state more effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot establishes a clear arc and the "battle" drives it towards a hook. However, the coherence suffers significantly when the "jumbled codes" and "financial symbols that meant nothing to mortal markets" resolve into simplistic, direct letter substitutions (SRAH-LIVE). This undermines the credibility of an "omniscient mind" and the intellectual challenge Marcus faces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "forgotten library in a deserted temple" is a strong, atmospheric setting, effectively using sensory details like "dust motes dancing" and "cracked stained glass" to enhance the mood and the mystical nature of the Oracle. The connection between the teddy bear and this sacred, forgotten space is poignant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (teddy bear, stock ticker) and presents a unique premise. However, emotional states like "anxious elation" and "heart hammering" are often stated directly rather than purely shown, and the simplicity of the initial decoded messages lessens the impact and perceived difficulty of the "intellectual duel."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The concept of a stock ticker Oracle is strikingly original. However, the narrative leans on some common tropes (e.g., proving worth to a mystical entity) and the decoded messages (SRAH-LIVE, BTNS-SAFE) are overly convenient and direct, lacking the nuanced, esoteric quality implied by "financial symbols that meant nothing to mortal markets," making the interaction feel somewhat formulaic despite the novel setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable cohesion with its disparate elements, creating an intriguing scenario. The core concept is imaginative. However, the critical mechanism of divine communication—the codes—transitions from mysterious to surprisingly simple, which doesn't fully deliver on the promise of a "battle of intellects" with "infinity itself," thereby missing the mark for flawless execution.</comment>
