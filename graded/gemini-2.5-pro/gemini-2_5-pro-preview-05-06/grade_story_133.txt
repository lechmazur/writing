<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Alistair's core trait of jadedness feels underdeveloped against his rapid intrigue; Elara's menace is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progression is clear, but the inciting incident's plausibility (a pottery class as an "exclusive gathering" drawing this specific locksmith) feels somewhat strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard provides a striking and symbolic setting, though other world details like "colonial town" remain generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While rich with symbolism (gloves, orchard), key revelations and Alistair's internal shift are delivered somewhat overtly rather than emerging organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Offers an original premise for the encounter, but the prose occasionally relies on familiar literary expressions ("stubborn ember," "menacing aura") rather than consistently sharp originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>A competent and intriguing opening, but lacks the exceptional character nuance and narrative subtlety expected for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
