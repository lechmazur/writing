<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Silas's core motivation as a con artist is clear and drives his actions, but the "lull of remorse" feels somewhat superficially treated, a brief nod rather than a deeply resonant internal conflict, diminishing its impact on his otherwise well-defined persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot forms a neat, self-contained arc driven by the unique action of interrogating ghosts; however, the specific connection between the tape dispenser's spectacular past failure and its vaguely suggested future utility lacks sharp definition.</comment>
