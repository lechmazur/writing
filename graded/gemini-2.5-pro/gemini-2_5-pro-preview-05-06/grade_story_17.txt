<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong core motivation (guilt, forgiveness); "brazen modesty" attribute present but not deeply explored as a pervasive character trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear internal arc towards renewal within the word limit; the "zoom/shimmer" epiphany, while set up, feels slightly convenient as the sole catalyst for change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative witch's chamber atmosphere is a major strength, rich with sensory detail; "atypically typical" description feels somewhat self-conscious or writerly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bowl, light) and a well-explored theme of unconventional atonement; the ending on "the brink" is purposeful and fitting for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly original premise combining disparate elements; ambitious, rich prose is mostly strong but occasionally borders on overwriting or density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive integration of numerous assigned elements into a meaningful narrative; creates a memorable, thoughtful vignette that lingers.</comment>
