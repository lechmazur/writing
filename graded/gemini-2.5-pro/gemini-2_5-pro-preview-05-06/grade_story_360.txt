<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Achieves a clear and satisfying micro-arc of revelation; 'cosmic knowledge' regained feels more like a new perception than a distinct piece of lore.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and thoughtful vignette on perception; small contrivances and under-leveraged character facets prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
