<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation is clear and his reaction to the climax is strong, but the "graceful swordsman" attribute feels more like an aesthetic flourish than a deeply integrated trait fundamentally shaping his technical aptitude or unique approach to innovation beyond generic discipline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is commendably tight for the word count, delivering a compelling arc and an impactful twist; however, the technical specificity of "cosmic signals in broken TVs" relies somewhat heavily on narrative assertion rather than subtle grounding within the story's internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater city garden" setting is highly original and atmospherically potent, with the "bird songs" motif effectively enhancing mood shifts; the oppressive "Enclave," however, remains a somewhat abstract, off-stage threat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves significant thematic resonance and a memorable, thought-provoking climax, with generally effective use of imagery; however, a few descriptive passages ("ethereal bird songs," "lucid frenzy born from an unyielding hope") lean towards the ornate, potentially sacrificing some directness for stylistic ambition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central method of scavenging and the narrative twist offer notable originality; yet, the protagonist archetype (rebel against conformity) and certain stylistic choices tread somewhat familiar ground, and the link between "swordsman" and "tech scavenger" feels more asserted than organically demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story powerfully delivers its core twist and demonstrates creative integration of most elements; however, the "swordsman" characteristic feels less intrinsically essential to the plot mechanics and thematic development compared to other, more seamlessly woven components.</comment>
