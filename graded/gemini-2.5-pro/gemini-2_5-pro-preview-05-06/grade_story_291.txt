<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rope symbolism effective, but "singular" motivation is slightly blunt and character voice, while resolute, lacks deep distinctiveness in third-person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc and effective reveal of the manufactured prejudice; the "overlook" action smartly propels the narrative within the tight word limit.</comment>
