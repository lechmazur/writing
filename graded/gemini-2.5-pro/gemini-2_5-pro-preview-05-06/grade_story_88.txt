<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation and attribute are clear, but the 'toaster' confinement feels superficial to the main datascape narrative, being quickly transcended rather than an integrated constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc and well-utilized core concept/action, but the plot remains a simple processional, lacking significant tension or complex development beyond fulfilling a set purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative dataspace and strong 'shouting silence' atmosphere, but the specific 'Sumerian' label for the palace feels somewhat aesthetically arbitrary without deeper thematic justification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and impactful imagery effectively convey themes, though the stylistic richness occasionally borders on overwriting, sacrificing some precision for elaborate description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly original premise and fresh central metaphors, but the pervasively elevated style, while thematically linked, risks appearing self-consciously literary to an extremely exacting reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative integration of most elements and strong atmosphere, but the initial 'toaster' framing feels underutilized within the core story, becoming a somewhat vestigial detail.</comment>
