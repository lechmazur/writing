<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character feels more like a vehicle for the theme than a deeply realized individual; "undercover" aspect lacks impact and the "test of faith" is articulated rather than profoundly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on a convenient accident (shoelace) for its inciting incident, and the intellectual neatness of the resolution feels somewhat manufactured for such a high-stakes premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting effectively conveys "graceless beauty" and the workshop is a strong imaginative space, though the "thought experiment" framing feels slightly imposed rather than organically emergent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambitious prose sometimes verges on pretentious (e.g., "singularly multiple"), and thematic points become overly explicit towards the end, lessening the subtlety and reader discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (nature vs. machine) and some key phrasing ("singularly multiple") feels self-consciously literary and artificial rather than authentically original or resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic ambition is clear, but the execution feels labored at times, with the "effort" of construction visible, preventing it from achieving the seamlessness of truly top-tier fiction.</comment>
