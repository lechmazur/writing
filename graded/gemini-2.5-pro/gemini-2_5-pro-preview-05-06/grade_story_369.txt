<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "fanatical" aspect is somewhat asserted rather than viscerally demonstrated; complex emotional states ("optimistically bitter") are often explicitly stated by the narrator, reducing opportunity for subtler character revelation through action or deep subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot is predominantly internal and minimal; the "wriggle" action offers very slight narrative impetus. Coherence is maintained, but progression relies heavily on exposition of Alistair's feelings rather than compelling events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the lighthouse setting creates a suitable atmosphere, the initial description ("mysterious lighthouse") is generic. Sensory details are adequate but lack striking originality or depth to make the world exceptionally vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Impact is lessened by a tendency to explicitly state Alistair's emotional and thematic burdens (e.g., "weight of secrets pressed down") instead of consistently showing them through more indirect, nuanced narrative techniques.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Noticeable repetition of key descriptive phrases ("lethargic excitement," "mysterious") and reliance on some familiar tropes without sufficient subversion. Some emotional descriptions feel constructed rather than organically emergent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated, but the narrative feels more like a carefully assembled response to constraints than a work of singular vision. It establishes mood effectively but lacks profound resonance or artistic sharpness.</comment>
