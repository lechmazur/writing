<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Commendable arc from observer to participant, though the full depth of the "cautious" nature's struggle before the final commitment could be further amplified for top-tier impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc from introduction to resolution within the tight word limit, driven effectively by the central "rally."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "Serpent Skull" setting and "ordered disarray" tone create a strong, evocative atmosphere, though sensory details could be even more consistently vivid throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (grass art, rosary) and a clear theme of quiet resistance, but the concluding sentence leans towards "telling" the epiphany rather than purely "showing" it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept of protest through ephemeral art is original, but the threefold repetition of the phrase "typically uncommon" feels artificial and detracts from otherwise clean prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story successfully weaves most elements into a cohesive whole with a poignant message, but the conspicuous repetition of an assigned attribute slightly mars its literary polish.</comment>
