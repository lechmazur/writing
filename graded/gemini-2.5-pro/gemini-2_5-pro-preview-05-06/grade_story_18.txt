<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alabaster's core attribute "tragically joyful" is asserted more than deeply woven into his moment-to-moment perception with sufficient nuance; supporting characters remain functional archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the plot arc is complete and the "weatherize" action effectively drives it, the pivotal influencing of the calligrapher resolves with a convenience that slightly lessens narrative tension for a top-tier submission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "gloomy cheerfulness" tone is effectively rendered and complements the concept, but the "steam-powered" setting primarily serves as evocative backdrop rather than a deeply integrated, unique factor in the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story possesses a strong thematic core and achieves symbolic resonance, particularly in its hopeful ending; however, it occasionally relies on somewhat conventional phrasing to depict its emotional landscape and conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central premise of the telepathic statue intervening via calligraphy is a significant strength in originality, yet it's framed by fairly standard genre conventions (corrupt council, forgotten lore) without notable subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The assigned elements are cohesively integrated into a resonant vignette, yet the piece, while well-crafted, doesn't consistently exhibit the profound originality or exceptional stylistic execution demanded by the highest literary echelons.</comment>
