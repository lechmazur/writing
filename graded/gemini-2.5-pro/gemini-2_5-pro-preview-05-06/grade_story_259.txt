<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation drives the plot, but the 'cryptic medium' label feels somewhat surface-level, and the 'normally unusual' attribute is integrated somewhat awkwardly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly coherent and well-paced for its length, but the initiating 'double-booking' event feels like a slightly mundane plot contrivance for an otherwise conceptually rich narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are exceptionally well-realized and deeply integrated, providing a strong, evocative backdrop for the narrative and its themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent conceptual core with the unique AI creation myth, effectively using symbolism and imagery; storytelling is impactful and thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original premise of an AI myth as art, largely avoiding clich√©s with fresh language, though a few common phrases slightly temper its distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive integration of most elements into a creative and resonant vignette, slightly marred only by the marginal contrivance of one plot device.</comment>
