<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>“Reserved” and “humbly proud” attributes are effectively portrayed, and motivation is clear; however, the “oracle” designation feels more like an intriguing label than a fully activated trait within the story's central discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc and maintains coherence, but the plot's crucial turning point relies on a convenient coincidence rather than a more integrated or character-driven catalyst.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere, but the lab's specific "sound" focus isn't functionally integral to the visual discovery, diluting the setting's unique potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story employs effective metaphors and conveys its theme, but the central conflict's resolution through serendipity somewhat diminishes the impact of the character's struggle and the story's potential depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Competent prose, but originality is hampered by reliance on a familiar discovery trope (secrets behind wallpaper) without significant subversion or a uniquely compelling voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates good cohesion of its elements, but its reliance on a convenient plot device for the central revelation prevents it from reaching the highest level of literary achievement expected.</comment>
