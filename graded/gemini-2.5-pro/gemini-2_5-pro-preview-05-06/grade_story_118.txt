<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unit 734's concept as a "hive-mind therapist" is compelling and its motivation ("to anchor the ephemeral in reality") is clear and drives the narrative; however, the "hive-mind" characteristic feels somewhat under-explored, functioning more like a singular, albeit unique, entity. The "merry bitterness" is distinctive but occasionally feels more asserted than organically revealed through nuanced action or internal thought progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot, centered on the action of "draining" psychic residue, is coherent and achieves a satisfying arc by reinterpreting the "bold discovery" as the codification of failure. The pacing is well-managed for the vignette style. The initial "whispers of anticipation" creates slight tonal dissonance with the story's deeply internal and somber focus, though the thematic payoff is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "secret agent training facility" setting and the "night air on the eve of a bold discovery" timeframe are exceptionally well-integrated, creating a thick, expectant, and slightly grim atmosphere that strongly supports the peculiar action and philosophical concept. Sensory details like the "sizzled faintly" wax and "chilled obsidian slab" are evocative and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story excels in its thematic depth, exploring the institutionalization of failure and the nature of regret with a unique perspective. Literary devices, particularly the central metaphor of waxen necromancy and the "map of Thorne's demise," are potent. The ending, "another ghost made useful," is chillingly effective and prompts significant reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept and its execution are highly original. While the writing style is ambitious and often effective, some phrases ("symphony of synthesized consciousness," "ephemeral, agonizing 'if onlys'") verge on the overly ornate, risking a "purple prose" feel. The "director's smile" is a minor clich√© in an otherwise fresh narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story masterfully weaves its assigned elements into a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative that lingers with the reader. The brief length feels deliberate, concentrating its impact. The creative synthesis of a hive-mind therapist, psychic residue, and wax-based necromancy to explore failure is a significant strength.</comment>
