<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "soul-broker" concept is evocative, but the assigned "grandiose modesty" is overtly stated ("a perfect display") rather than consistently and subtly embodied, diminishing nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc; however, the core concept ("art of persuasion") is somewhat didactically presented ("He believed...") rather than purely revealed through action, slightly undermining sophisticated narrative integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "floating tea platform" and "recycling epochs" create a strong, imaginative setting; the "weirdly static" attribute enhances this, though a few descriptive phrases verge on common lyrical tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful mood and uses literary devices well, but occasionally tells the emotional significance (e.g., "heartbreakingly expressed") instead of purely showing its impact, reducing its profoundness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central premise is highly original; however, some lyrical phrasing feels familiar, and the direct authorial explanation of character traits/beliefs (e.g., Alistair's view on persuasion, his modesty) detracts from a truly unique voice and masterful subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is imaginative and largely cohesive with its elements; for the highest tier, it requires greater subtlety in conveying its themes and character complexities, avoiding any hint of authorial intrusion or overly familiar phrasing.</comment>
