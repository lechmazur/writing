<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong ironic premise ("humorless comedic actor"), but the specific motivation's link to this trait feels slightly arbitrary; "objectively personal" attribute is more asserted than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear internal arc to concession, but "daydream loops" as the direct causal method for this realization are somewhat vague and less impactful than the overall contemplative atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a significant strength; the desolate setting is powerfully rendered and thematically resonant, though some descriptions ("time's unraveling tapestry") risk feeling mannered with repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and a poignant ending, but the central conflict's resolution feels more intellectually inevitable due to its premise than dramatically earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Original core concept, but the ambitious prose occasionally strays into floridity ("cosmic expiration"), and some stylistic choices (repeated phrases) detract from organic flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Achieves a thoughtful, meditative cohesion, but the "unwanted gifts" concept feels somewhat superficially integrated rather than being a core driver of the character's deeper existential crisis.</comment>
