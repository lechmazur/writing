<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot, initiated by a conventional flat tire, unfolds with excellent coherence and pacing for a short piece, achieving a clear and satisfying arc from disruption to revelation and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting as an "echo chamber" is masterfully used, with vivid sensory details creating a potent atmosphere that is integral to the character's introspection and the story's thematic depth.</comment>
