<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "typically atypical" attribute feels somewhat intellectualized and less organically embodied than her dedication to farming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story presents a coherent vignette with a clear emotional arc, but the plot is slight and the resolution with the blue sprout, while thematic, feels somewhat convenient and lacks deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "ethereal plains" and post-war timeframe create a strong, evocative atmosphere, with sensory details effectively supporting Elara's motivation and the "song of boundaries" concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance and uses symbolism well (seeds, cards), but the impact is slightly diminished by moments of telling emotion ("raw solace settled") rather than purely showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and rich, but at times tips towards being overly ornate or "writerly," and the "typically atypical" descriptor feels somewhat constructed, lacking full organic nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story cohesively incorporates most elements and achieves a thoughtful, resonant mood, but the density of assigned elements occasionally makes the narrative feel slightly constrained rather than entirely fluid.</comment>
