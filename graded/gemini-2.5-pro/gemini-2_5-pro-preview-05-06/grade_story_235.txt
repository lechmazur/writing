<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kenji's core motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'herbalist' aspect feels less narratively active compared to his celestial interpretations until the final sentence; the 'dramatically subtle' attribute is also slightly ambiguous in its execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot presents a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, effectively driven by the central action, though the meteor-decoding premise requires reader acceptance of its mystical nature to fully engage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient castle setting and the 'distant intimacy' tone are exceptionally well-realized, creating a potent atmosphere that strongly supports the narrative and character interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext creates a resonant emotional impact; however, the final sentence explicitly stating the herbalist's knowledge slightly undermines the preceding subtlety by 'telling' rather than 'showing'.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's core premise offers originality, but the prose occasionally verges on overly ornate ('velvet sky'), and there's a noticeable repetition of certain thematic words (e.g., 'quiet', 'subtle') that could be refined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Creative integration of elements and a lingering emotional resonance are clear strengths, though the 'herbalist' element feels less seamlessly woven into the main narrative thrust until its explicit mention at the conclusion.</comment>
