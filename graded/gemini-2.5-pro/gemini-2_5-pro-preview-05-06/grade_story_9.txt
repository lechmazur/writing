<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: A coherent internal arc for Elara within the vignette format, achieving a sense of completeness. Weakness: The external plot is minimal, with the "magnify" action being primarily introspective, thus limiting conventional narrative progression.</comment>
