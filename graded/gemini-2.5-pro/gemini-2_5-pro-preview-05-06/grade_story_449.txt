<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Awkwardness is stated but not convincingly demonstrated or integrated with her champion status/actions; motivation is clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc and well-used central action ("fuse"), but some background elements feel extraneous to this specific plot, and stakes are primarily internal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory details and effective atmospheric juxtaposition (cosmic/domestic); however, the "time dilation" aspect of the setting remains unutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Intriguing core concept ("quiet benedictions") and effective symbolism, but emotional impact is somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through nuanced showing; prose occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High originality in premise and the combination of elements; however, minor repetitive phrasing ("haunting delight") and a few generic descriptors slightly mar overall freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Creative and generally cohesive integration of most assigned elements, particularly the baking timeframe; however, some aspects (character's awkwardness, full setting potential) are underdeveloped for flawless execution.</comment>
