<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (ascension) is clear, but the 'nostalgic tailor' attribute feels superficial, barely influencing actions or voice beyond a single, somewhat forced metaphor. The character lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (uncertainty -> confession -> merging -> resolution) driven by the 'reassure' action via confessions. The 'code broken' setup works, but the resolution feels abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk setting and storm create a strong atmosphere, effectively using sensory details (rain, lightning, thunder, cold glass). The 'dusty mirror' integrates well as a focal point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Attempts symbolism (mirror, storm) but relies heavily on explicitly stated emotions ("hopeful desperation," "uncertainty gnawed") rather than subtle showing. The central conflict is clear but resolved predictably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on the common 'meeting oneself in a mirror' trope and standard atmospheric clich√©s (storm reflecting inner turmoil). Language often feels ornate ("brass-rimmed windows," "weary soul") rather than genuinely fresh or authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but some (like 'tailor') feel poorly integrated, suggesting the elements dictated the story rather than serving it organically. Cohesive but lacks genuine depth or originality.</comment>
