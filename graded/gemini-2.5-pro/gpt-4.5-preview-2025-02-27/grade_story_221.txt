<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation (escape tradition) is clear, but the 'wreck-diver ghost whisperer' trait feels superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into the core conflict or voice, which remains somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure achieves a clear arc (hesitation -> confrontation -> resolution) effectively within the word limit. Pacing is adequate, and the ghost encounter serves as a logical catalyst for change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting strongly enhances the themes of memory, decay, and faded tradition. The atmosphere effectively supports the 'joyfully melancholic' tone and the character's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber) is clear and central. The story evokes a gentle melancholy, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by predictable dialogue and resolution. Craft is competent but lacks striking originality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on familiar tropes (wise ghost guiding protagonist, symbolic object representing burden). Language occasionally borders on clich√© ("whispering memories," "heart begin to thaw"). Lacks a truly unique voice or surprising narrative turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Most elements are woven together cohesively, particularly the setting, object, and motivation. The story serves the elements reasonably well, achieving a sense of completeness despite the brevity, though it doesn't transcend its components into something truly exceptional.</comment>
