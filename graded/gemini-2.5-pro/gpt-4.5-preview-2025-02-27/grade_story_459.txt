<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Eli's core traits (elevator tech, ghost-seer, elegantly clumsy) feel somewhat disparate and superficially connected; his motivation for liberation emerges late, prompted externally rather than driving his actions organically throughout. The 'elegantly clumsy' attribute is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses from setup to encounter to resolution, but the connection between Eli's routine (job, lab visits) and the method (staking out tours) feels slightly disjointed. The resolution hinges heavily on the ghost's exposition, making Eli's arc feel somewhat passive and abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting provides a strong thematic anchor and atmosphere, contrasting preservation with impermanence. However, its connection to Eli's profession feels tenuous, and the 'amid lunch breaks' timeframe feels tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (sand castles, dried flowers) to explore themes of impermanence and letting go. The writing achieves moments of evocative imagery, but the emotional impact relies heavily on direct statements from the ghost rather than subtext or Eli's fully developed internal journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the combination of elements offers some originality, the prose occasionally dips into slightly overwrought or generic phrasing ("profound sadness," "quiet sorrow"). The ghost directly explaining her plight and Eli's immediate understanding feels somewhat formulaic for the genre.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story attempts cohesion but struggles to fully integrate all assigned elements seamlessly (especially the job). The theme is clear, but its realization feels slightly forced by the plot mechanics rather than emerging entirely organically from character and situation. The brevity highlights the compressed character arc.</comment>
