<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is clear and evolves credibly from a personal quest to a public duty. However, the interiority relies on a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("To be sensitively perceptive was a curse"), which slightly abstracts the emotion rather than fully embodying it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and propulsive Causal lens from discovery to consequence. The closure is a strong Decisive Change, with the protagonist's role shifting from observer to witness, landing with a clear, felt cost that is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is highly atmospheric and purposeful, directly constraining the plot's climax in the "ivy-veiled passage." The details are not merely descriptive but are integral to the discovery process, particularly the fireplace and the wall itself, which function as key narrative objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively signaled and then deepened, shifting from an intellectual pursuit to a heavy moral imperative. The discovery of the negative provides a single, meaningful tightening that forces an earned resolution at a clear personal cost for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of bearing witness to past failures is potent and well-integrated into the central conflict. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary ("a stark lesson in the cost of choosing willful blindness"), explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the final action to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the story. The narrative voice is consistent and clear, but it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature or syntactic rhythm that would elevate it to exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clean and evocative, but the final paragraph shifts into summary. Phrasing like "She gave them the glimpse of the precise failure" is a prose artifact that tells the reader the event's significance instead of letting the dramatized action carry the weight, dulling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a "corridor echo cartographer" is wonderfully fresh and provides an ingenious angle on a post-apocalyptic narrative. This unique occupation and method of discovery elevates the story, offering a memorable synthesis of sci-fi and historical reckoning.</comment>
