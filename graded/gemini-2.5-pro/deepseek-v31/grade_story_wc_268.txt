<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aetos is a compelling and well-realized protagonist, defined by the potent contradiction of being a "diminutive titan." His motivation is clear and vast, and his actions, from the scholar's tenderness to his quiet, immovable confidence in the climax, are perfectly aligned with his established character. The pretender is functional for this length, serving as a catalyst whose arrogance effectively highlights Aetos's quiet power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens, with each beat logically leading to the next. The structure is clean and powerful, moving from setup to a sharp, decisive climax and a resonant close. The closure, a Decisive Change where the pretender is psychically unmasked, lands on the page with a clear, felt cost ("scream, not of pain but of profound disorientation"), making the resolution deeply earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is superb, a fully realized atmosphere of "graceful collapse" and "sublime ruin." Sensory details like "ozone and decaying vellum" are vivid and purposeful, creating a tone that permeates the story. Crucially, the setting is not merely a backdrop; the library books are the medium for the conflict, and the book page becomes the very ground on which the final battle is won, perfectly satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking a false heir to preserve history—is established early and tested in a direct, high-stakes confrontation. The escalation is sharp and driven entirely by the protagonist's agency; Aetos doesn't just react but uses his meticulous preparation to turn the antagonist's power against him. The cost of the pretender's stolen legacy being sundered is definite and satisfyingly executed on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth's permanence versus fraudulent power is expertly woven through the narrative, not stated. Lines like "The truth is already written. It cannot be unwritten" crystallize the central idea without moralizing. The final image—the ink pellet placed like a period—is a masterful, non-literal conclusion that resonates with the story's core conceit, providing a powerful thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, establishing a mythic tone from the first sentence. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a precise, evocative vocabulary that perfectly matches the ancient, scholarly protagonist. The brief dialogue is sharp and potent, revealing character and escalating the conflict without a wasted word, showcasing excellent control of psychic distance and voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense, polished, and propulsive, with a high degree of information and atmosphere packed into each sentence. The line-level craft is exceptional, avoiding redundancies or cliché phrasing. While the style is ornate, it remains clear and purposeful, serving the epic tone without devolving into purple prose, even during the high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While using familiar fantasy tropes (ancient libraries, magic runes, usurper kings), the story transforms them through its highly specific execution. The core concept of a "diminutive titan" and the "rune of drift" as a tool of subtle misalignment feel fresh and ingenious. The climax, a clever redirection of force rather than a brute-force fight, provides a satisfying and original resolution.</comment>
