<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. Leo's motivation—his "private vocation"—is clear and drives his actions, while his contradictory rule to "never engage" creates a potent internal conflict. The final choice to speak is an earned, decisive change, transforming the "weightless burden" of his sight into a tangible responsibility. The integration of his professional skills with his supernatural sensitivity is seamless and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's Causal structure is flawless and executed with superb economy. Every beat logically follows from the last, from the initial observation to the final, earned resolution. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost—the breaking of a lifelong rule. This piece is a model of structural integrity for its length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with masterful specificity, becoming a character in its own right through details like the "living" silence and the "sweet-and-sour ghost of popcorn." Atmosphere is thick and purposeful. Critically, the environment—specifically the vaulted ceiling and the heavy desk—constrains and enables the story's central discovery, fully integrating place into plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central conflict between Leo’s professional curiosity and his personal rule of non-engagement is established immediately and tested decisively. The pressure escalates perfectly when the ghost points, forcing a choice that brings the internal and external stakes into alignment. The resolution is driven entirely by Leo's agency, and the cost of his choice is legible in his acceptance of a new, tangible burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of bearing witness to forgotten acts of courage emerges organically from the plot, anchored in the resonant metaphor of the "cracked façade." The story avoids any didacticism, instead delivering its thematic weight through the final image of Leo holding the "cool, solid truth." It's a quiet but profound exploration of memory and recognition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with unwavering control, establishing a distinct and compelling narrative voice that is both professionally detached and privately burdened. Leo's perceptual signature, filtering the world through the lens of a technician, is consistent and effective. The prose rhythm and diction are masterfully calibrated to the story's melancholic, observant tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb. The prose exhibits high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, original imagery ("dust motes... drifted in the dimness like lazy confetti"). There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting. The piece is a showcase of clarity, precision, and rhythmic control from the opening sentence to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>While the "person who sees ghosts" is a familiar trope, its synthesis with the unique vocation of an elevator technician obsessed with ceilings is fresh and ingenious. The story's focus on witnessing a heroic act, rather than a typical haunting, provides a powerful and original emotional core. The execution is so specific and grounded that the premise feels entirely new.</comment>
