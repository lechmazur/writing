<question>1</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The character designation "necromancer" is entirely unsupported by the text; his actions, tools, and motivations align with a scientist or explorer, creating a fundamental dissonance. Motivation (mapping/preservation) is clear but disconnected from the assigned character type.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a simple arc (scan, reflect, leave) within the word limit, but the core action "dominate" is weakly interpreted as mapping. The connection between the method (old movies) and the action is tenuous, serving only as character grounding, not plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered, and the "futuristic nostalgia" tone is effectively woven through the contrast between ancient nature and sleek technology, enhanced by evocative sensory details (bioluminescence, humming tools).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While competent, the writing lacks significant impact or depth. Imagery is present but not exceptional. The attempt at subtext (legacy) feels stated rather than earned. The central conflict (mapping vs. collapse) provides basic tension, but the overall craft lacks the distinction required for top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The inexplicable "necromancer" label strongly suggests a formulaic or AI-generated element mismatch, severely damaging authenticity. While some descriptions are nice, the overall narrative lacks a unique voice and relies on somewhat predictable emotional beats ("resolve echoing softly").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story fails cohesion primarily due to the jarring "necromancer" element, which feels forced upon the narrative rather than integral to it. While other elements like the setting and motivation integrate better, this core inconsistency prevents the story from feeling whole or publishable at a high level.</comment>
