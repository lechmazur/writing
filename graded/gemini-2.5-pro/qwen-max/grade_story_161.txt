<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation (tragedy) is clear and drives action, but the 'sardonic glee' attribute feels asserted rather than consistently embodied in voice or action. The connection to the seal is functional, but the use of the 'peacock method' feels weakly linked to personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a standard discovery-investigation-exposure arc, fitting the word count adequately. However, the 'peacock's tail' method feels contrived and poorly integrated as a logical investigative technique, weakening coherence. The resolution involving the engineer feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The unusual setting (paper airplane facility) provides interesting contrast but isn't deeply explored. The atmosphere supports the conspiracy theme, and the seal connects meaningfully to the plot discovery. The 'sardonic glee' tone is inconsistently maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (seal, peacock), but the execution, particularly the peacock metaphor, feels heavy-handed. The central conflict is clear, but the emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing (e.g., stating bitterness, glee). The ending provides resolution but lacks significant resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements is somewhat unique, but the core conspiracy plot is highly generic. The 'patterns in a peacock's tail' metaphor feels forced and artificial, bordering on clich√© without subversion. Character reasoning is straightforward; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story struggles to make the disparate elements feel organic; the peacock method, in particular, feels shoehorned in. While cohesive on a surface level, the narrative feels constructed *around* the prompts rather than flowing naturally from them. The brief length contains the plot, but depth is sacrificed.</comment>
