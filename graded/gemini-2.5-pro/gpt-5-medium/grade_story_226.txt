<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and motivation is poetically integrated, but the narrator's late adoption of "craftsman's pride" feels slightly too neat, mirroring the technician in a way that risks feeling symbolic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and coherent, but the central scene lacks immediate stakes or friction. The transaction is almost too smooth, relying entirely on atmospheric tension rather than a present obstacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a mystical, elegiac tone with a sterile, high-tech setting is masterful. The sensory details are specific and create a profoundly immersive, unique atmosphere that is the story's greatest strength.</comment>
