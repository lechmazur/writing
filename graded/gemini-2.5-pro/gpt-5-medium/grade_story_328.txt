<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character is more a well-chosen archetype than a person; the "assertively meek" attribute is demonstrated performatively in one key scene rather than being an organic, underlying trait that subtly informs all actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot coheres within its own dream-logic, but the foundational solution—the tapestry appearing from spilled water—functions as a convenient, magical deus ex machina that feels at odds with the established technological nature of the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is superb and immersive, built on a cascade of sensory details. However, the world's rules feel secondary to its poetics; the fusion of digital glitches and an ancient, magical tapestry is thematically powerful but lacks a rigorous internal consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is undeniable, with a stunning density of fresh literary devices. Its only weakness is this very density; the prose is so relentlessly stylized and metaphorical that it occasionally feels self-aware, risking the subordination of narrative to stylistic exhibition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, successfully subverting the "man vs. machine" trope. The execution avoids cliché, but the sheer polish and non-stop stream of clever, poetic phrases can feel like its own kind of formula, a "literary" pattern that is beautiful but lacks a certain raw edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is an exceptional, cohesive whole built from challenging parts. It is a masterclass in controlled, poetic prose. However, its near-flawless execution and intellectual coolness keep the reader at an admiring distance, making it feel more like a brilliant artifact than a raw, resonant experience.</comment>
