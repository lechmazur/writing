<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's core trait, "jumpy," feels more stated than deeply inhabited; the transformation to "resolute" is consequently too swift to be entirely convincing within this brief format.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot mechanics are impressively tight and logical within the world's rules, but the final confrontation and resolution feel slightly compressed, sacrificing potential impact for efficiency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's triumph; it achieves a rare synthesis where the setting is not just a backdrop but the fundamental language and logic of the narrative itself.</comment>
