<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's 'voice' is distinct but so uniformly poetic that it lacks nuance and feels more like a constructed persona than a person. The "underestimated" aspect of the rebel is asserted but not demonstrated, leaving the character feeling like an archetype—a vessel for the story's dense metaphors rather than a grounded individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete, if purely metaphorical, arc. However, the plot's coherence relies entirely on the reader accepting the central metaphor (fixing a haunted house primes a heart for wonder), which feels intellectually constructed rather than narratively earned. The pacing is deliberate, but the cause-and-effect is associative, not dramatic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere of "ephemeral gloom" is expertly rendered through specific, evocative sensory details. The haunted house setting functions powerfully as a controlling metaphor for the protagonist's internal state, and every description serves to deepen this connection. The world is immersive and tonally perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates significant literary craft, particularly in its sustained use of metaphor and fresh imagery ("map of ramen steam on my tongue"). However, the craft is heavy-handed. Every sentence strives for profundity, resulting in an overwrought style that lacks tonal variation and risks exhausting the reader. It's impressive, but lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements is highly original, and the metaphors are fresh. However, the story feels self-consciously literary, explicitly stating its core concept ("The art of adaptation taught me...") which reads more like an author's note than organic narrative. This signposting detracts from the originality, making it feel like a masterful but formulaic response to a writing prompt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is exceptionally cohesive, weaving its disparate elements into a tight symbolic web. Yet, its greatest strength—the relentlessly poetic style—is also its weakness. It prioritizes lyrical density over narrative clarity and emotional authenticity, feeling more like an impressive technical exercise than a story that breathes. It is trying too hard to be flawless.</comment>
