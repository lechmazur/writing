<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and powerful, perfectly blending bureaucratic language with mythic purpose ("I ticket my own impatience"). The "overzealous" trait is brilliantly reinterpreted as a spiritual dedication, making the motivation feel authentic within the story's surreal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete and satisfying mythic arc within the word count. The only slight weakness is the final sentence; the connection between tending the orchard and the entire city learning to breathe feels more asserted than earned, a conceptual leap that slightly undermines the preceding "show, don't tell" mastery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The world-building is flawless and deeply immersive. The fusion of the setting ("repurposed highway overpass") and timeframe ("after the last human dream is dreamt") creates a potent, original, and melancholic atmosphere that is the story's single greatest strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, driven by a cascade of inventive, resonant metaphors ("goddess...made of unspent exits"). While the prose is stunningly beautiful, its sheer density is relentless, risking a feeling of being stylistically overwrought and leaving little negative space for the reader to rest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in originality, weaving its disparate elements into a singular narrative that feels entirely fresh. The voice is unique and the imagery avoids clich√©, demonstrating a nuanced and confident authorial vision that is far from any formulaic template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, with every element serving the central theme and atmosphere. It feels less like a story written to prompts and more like a myth discovered intact. It successfully operates as a high-level prose poem, leaving a lasting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
