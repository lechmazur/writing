<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's stated "unsure" quality is slightly at odds with their immediate, decisive competence, making the internal arc feel more asserted than earned within the brief narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent, but the central conflict resolves with a swiftness that undermines the gravity of overturning ancient "broken precedents," thus reducing potential narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully evoked through consistent, high-quality sensory details and metaphors ("measured thunder," "furnaces that slept like lions") that bring the mythic setting to life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story shows remarkable skill in integrating disparate elements into a cohesive fable, but its frictionless resolution makes it feel more like a perfectly executed exercise than a gritty, complex narrative.</comment>
