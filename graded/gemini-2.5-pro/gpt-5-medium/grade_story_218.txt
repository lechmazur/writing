<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct and literary, but the character functions more as an elegant archetype for the central theme than as a fully realized, idiosyncratic individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A clear and coherent internal arc is achieved within the word count, but the plot is almost entirely psychological, with the inciting incident being the only significant external event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten clock tower is an outstanding objective correlative; the setting is not merely a backdrop but a core symbolic component that transforms in lockstep with the character.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is stylistically unique and avoids clich√©; metaphors are fresh, and the combination of game design with psychological healing feels highly original and not at all formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its many conceptual elements into a purposeful whole, though its intensely lyrical and internal nature makes it a niche, high-literary piece.</comment>
