<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's "solemnly silly" voice is distinct and expertly executed through both internal reflection and action, making the motivation feel nuanced and genuine. The "ghostly" aspect, however, remains an unexamined label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a remarkably complete and well-paced arc for its length, but the "last wish" functions as a convenient, unexplained trigger, slightly weakening the otherwise logical cause-and-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's absolute peak. The central paradox of the setting is rendered with exquisite, specific sensory detail, creating a unique and deeply immersive atmosphere that enhances every other element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high literary quality, rich with fresh, resonant metaphors. The density of figurative language is powerful but borders on being overworked, and the phrase "low, believable sentence" is a rare, slightly clunky moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates profound originality, particularly in its core setting and the combination of mundane and magical elements (plastic straw). The voice is singular, avoiding clich√© and formulaic expression almost entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels like a masterful, cohesive whole, using its required elements in service of a singular artistic vision. It transcends the feeling of being an exercise in prompt-following to become a memorable piece of flash fiction.</comment>
