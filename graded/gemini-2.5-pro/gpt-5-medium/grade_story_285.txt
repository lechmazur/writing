<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's core attributes (hesitant, awkward) are well-demonstrated through action and internal thought, but the central emotion of "rancor," however "ephemeral," is more stated than shown, making his internal conflict feel intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and complete arc, but the core conflict is resolved with a convenience that undermines dramatic tension. The registrar's immediate conversion based on a symbolic gesture feels more like a fable's moral than an earned narrative outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's most powerful element; it is original, deeply atmospheric, and inextricably linked to the plot, theme, and method. The contrast between frost and steam provides a perfect physical metaphor for the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is distinguished by its masterful use of integrated symbolism (shell, postcard, steam), creating profound subtext. However, the impact is slightly blunted by a resolution that feels too philosophical and frictionless, sidestepping a more challenging and potentially more resonant confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece is highly original, subverting the "swordsman" trope and employing a fresh central metaphor. The prose style is distinctive, though the seamless, tidy resolution of a complex human/political problem gives it a slightly artificial, parable-like quality that lacks messy human authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements into a unified, lyrical whole. Its primary weakness is that in its pursuit of thematic perfection, it sacrifices the grit of a believable conflict, making it feel more like a beautiful thesis than a story of struggle.</comment>
