<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and integrated into the story's economy ("this is how I eat: with recovered names"). Interiority is consistently voiced through unique, concrete metaphors rather than abstract labels. The final choice to return the name is earned through a sustained, focused effort that aligns perfectly with the character's established abilities and values, paying off with a felt, non-material cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the single scene structure is tight and focused. The closure unit is a powerful Decisive Change (recovering the name) that resolves into a moment of Resonant Reconfiguration (the "eternal instant" of shared stillness), with the cost clearly legible in the narrator's metaphysical exhaustion ("swallowed two worlds").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully rendered, immediately establishing a unique world that feels both fantastical and lived-in. Details like "dried thunder" and "ferments of moonlight" are not just decorative but establish the rules of this reality. Critically, the painting and the lighthouse lens fragment function as the active micro-setting, directly constraining the protagonist's actions and charging the final image, fulfilling the 9+ criteria perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stakes—recovering a lost identity—are established early and feel deeply personal. The conflict is primarily internal, a struggle of perception and intuition, which is deepened rather than escalated through a series of focused actions. The painter's initial dismissal provides a moment of external pressure, and the cost of the narrator's work is made tangible in the final beat ("did not want a third [world]"), ensuring the resolution feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, witness, and the language of art emerge organically from the story's concrete particulars without a single line of didacticism. The central concept—that overlooked histories refuse to stay silent—is dramatized, not explained. The final image of the name tied to the frame provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a powerful thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is the story's greatest triumph: it is singular, poetic, and utterly consistent. The narrator's perceptual signature ("translate what skylines say to shadows") defines the reality of the story and makes the fantastical elements feel grounded and psychologically true. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that modulates perfectly with the rising intensity of the narrator's focus, demonstrating supreme control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong, specific imagery. Sentences are crafted with high information density, frequently performing multiple functions of characterization, world-building, and advancing the plot. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or cliché; every line feels purposeful and polished. Figurative language, like the painter's laugh "like oars in their locks," is both original and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of a "between-worlds translator" operating in an alchemical market is highly original and expertly realized. The story synthesizes elements of fantasy, art criticism, and metaphysics into a coherent and emotionally resonant whole. Its quiet, introspective conflict feels fresh and meaningful, transforming the familiar "haunted object" trope into a profound meditation on memory and witness.</comment>
