<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of genres and the central imagery are unique, yet the underlying narrative follows a familiar allegorical template of humility triumphing over arrogance, which tempers its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is a masterclass in thematic cohesion, but its flawlessness is itself a weakness; it feels more like a perfectly polished allegorical gem than a raw, breathing narrative.</comment>
