<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinct and lyrical, but their characterization as a "rebel" feels underdeveloped; they read more as a preservationist. The internal arc from fear to resolve is too swift, facilitated by an external force rather than a deeper internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but relies on a ghostly deus ex machina for its resolution. The guildmaster's appearance, while thematically fitting, conveniently solves the protagonist's problems, negating the tension and sense of a hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The personification of the passage and the specific, evocative sensory details ("hymn of nails, dust," "cedar shavings") create a profoundly immersive and memorable world that is inseparable from the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, rich with fresh, powerful metaphors ("chapel disillusioned with sermons"). However, the craft is so polished it occasionally overshadows the emotional core, and the story's impact is softened by the simplistic resolution of its central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of architectural preservation with the supernatural is highly original, and the prose style is distinctive. The piece avoids clich√© in its language, though the helpful ghost mentor trope, while well-executed, is a familiar narrative device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>An aesthetically beautiful and cohesive piece whose ambition is slightly undercut by a too-convenient plot turn. While the language and atmosphere are ready for publication, the core narrative resolution lacks the grit and complexity expected at the highest level.</comment>
