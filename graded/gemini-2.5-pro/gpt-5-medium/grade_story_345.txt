<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and powerfully poetic, but its unwavering metaphorical density occasionally risks sounding more like a literary device than a person's authentic internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative provides a clear and satisfying arc within the word count, but the protagonist's progression of insight feels very linear, lacking the potential for a false turn or setback that could deepen the conflict within the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The surreal setting and pervasive tone are masterfully interwoven, creating a palpable atmosphere that is the story's greatest strength, perfectly externalizing the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally high, with rich, layered symbolism; however, it occasionally undermines its own subtlety by explicitly stating its core metaphors (e.g., "the orchard is a ledger"), slightly reducing the reader's work of discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is highly original, weaving its disparate elements into a unique and memorable tapestry, and the prose avoids clich√© by establishing a distinct, if relentlessly consistent, authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is a powerful, cohesive whole where every element serves the central theme, though its final thematic and narrative tidiness slightly undercuts its own potent celebration of ambiguity and confusion.</comment>
