<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character’s arc from pride to a shared humility is too neat for the story's length, making the resolution feel more like a summary of change than an earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is a complete and clever arc, but its density makes the resolution feel rushed; the grimoire provides a spell that solves the core emotional problem with too much convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The world-building is fantastically evocative, but the relentless cascade of metaphors and personification ("vines arguing," "bridges pulsed like throats") risks overwhelming the narrative, a style in need of restraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While demonstrating a unique voice and masterful use of imagery, the sheer density of literary devices blunts their individual impact, at times prioritizing stylistic flourish over narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept is fresh, but the stylistic pattern—a constant delivery of clever, poetic metaphors—becomes its own form of predictable formula, feeling more like a performance than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>An ambitious and imaginative piece, but its primary flaw is a lack of narrative restraint; the prose is so consistently overwrought that it suffocates the genuinely compelling story underneath.</comment>
