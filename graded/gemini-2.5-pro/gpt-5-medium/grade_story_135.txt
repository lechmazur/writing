<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character’s voice is exceptionally strong and poetic, but the characterization is somewhat one-note, and the parallel "fiercely loyal" attribute with Orla feels slightly too symmetrical and constructed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word count, but the climax relies on a poetic leap of logic—using a poster of routes as real-time coordinates—that strains narrative plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's singular triumph; the setting is deeply original, immersive, and all sensory details work in perfect service of the central theme and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates masterful cohesion, weaving its many assigned elements into a resonant and memorable whole. It is on the cusp of publishability, held back only by minor points of logical strain and stylistic excess.</comment>
