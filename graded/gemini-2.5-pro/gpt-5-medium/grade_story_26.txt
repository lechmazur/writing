<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character serves as an effective first-person vessel for the story's theme, but lacks a specific personal history of the shame they seek to resolve, keeping them slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is not driven by external events but by a powerful and coherent internal, philosophical arc that achieves a profound sense of resolution within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional; the 'neon orchard' is not merely a backdrop but a central mechanism of the plot and a perfect metaphor for the story's themes of nature and data.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is superb, particularly the sustained use of metaphor (grief as code, memory's iron posture) which allows the story to explore its abstract themes with tangible, emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While highly original, the relentlessly elevated, poetic prose borders on being overwrought, risking a sense of artifice that could detract from its emotional authenticity for some readers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates masterful cohesion, weaving its disparate assigned elements into a unified and resonant prose poem where every component serves the central theme of connection.</comment>
