<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and the motivation is clear, but its explicit statement ("my motive was simple enough...") is a rare moment of telling, rather than showing, which slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtlety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete and resonant psychological arc within the severe word constraint. The pacing is deliberate and flawless, building from quiet stasis to a cathartic, non-final resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's singular triumph. The central image of the glacial orchard is unique, powerfully evocative, and functions as an active participant in the narrative rather than a mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high order, but a few metaphors feel overly familiar (fear as a hissing creature) and the sheer density of figurative language borders on self-conscious, occasionally prioritizing lyricism over raw impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the "last person alive" framework is a familiar trope, the specific execution is highly original. The voice is distinctive, but the prose is so consistently polished and poetic that it lacks a certain grit, feeling more constructed than lived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its many required elements into a seamless whole. It feels like a deliberate, powerful vignette, though its literary polish is so high it risks feeling overwrought, like a piece aiming too overtly for prestige.</comment>
