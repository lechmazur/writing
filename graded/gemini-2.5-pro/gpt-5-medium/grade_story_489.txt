<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and poetic, but they function more as a mythic archetype than a person. The "unseen observer" status and "rusted bones" hint at a fascinating backstory that remains entirely unexplored, leaving the character feeling more like a beautifully crafted vessel for the theme than a developed entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight and effective for flash fiction. It establishes a clear setup, a precise inciting incident (the whale call/whistle response), a climax (the dance), and a resolution. The pacing is masterful, building anticipation and delivering a sense of completeness within the brief word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest triumph. The fusion of the mundane ("basic plastic whistle") and the mythic ("haunted lighthouse," "dancer robed in kelp") is sublime. Sensory details are specific, evocative, and consistently reinforce the story's solemn, magical mood. The world feels ancient and deeply realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates superior literary craft, particularly in its use of fresh, resonant metaphor ("tradition is not a chain but a boat"). The central theme—memory as a "braver haunting"—is powerful and well-executed. The only weakness is a prose style so consistently elevated that it lacks textural variety, bordering on being overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original. The story subverts the "haunted lighthouse" trope beautifully, and the core conceit of a plastic whistle summoning an ancient ritual is inventive and memorable. The language feels unique and authorial, avoiding clichés and demonstrating a fresh metaphorical imagination. It shows no signs of formulaic or AI-like construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and impactful piece of literary flash. The assigned elements feel integral and synergistic, not like a checklist. It's a rare example where constraint has bred profound creativity. While character depth is sacrificed for atmosphere and theme, the resulting work is memorable, thought-provoking, and very nearly flawless in its execution.</comment>
