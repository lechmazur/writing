<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchardist's arc is clear, but the child functions more as a sophisticated symbolic device than a character, sacrificing psychological depth for thematic resonance. Their dialogue serves as a Socratic prompt, fitting the fable-like quality but feeling less like natural speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure is exceptionally tight and coherent. The plot progresses logically from a single catalyst to a cascade of events, achieving a complete and satisfying arc within the word count. Pacing is masterful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central setting of the rooftop garden is brilliantly realized and evocative. However, the wider cyberpunk city relies on somewhat familiar genre tropes (e.g., "frostbitten chips") that feel less imaginative than the core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The craft is superb, with a dense, lyrical style rich in purposeful metaphor. The central symbolism of the key unlocking people, not doors, is executed with nuance and originality, culminating in a powerful, resonant ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece achieves a highly original voice by blending pastoral lyricism with cyberpunk aesthetics. However, the deliberate repetition of key phrases ("excited restraint," "hush between two heartbeats") borders on a stylistic mannerism that risks feeling self-conscious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a rare and masterful cohesion, integrating its many elements so seamlessly that they feel foundational rather than imposed. The brief length feels deliberate, concentrating its impact into a potent, memorable whole.</comment>
