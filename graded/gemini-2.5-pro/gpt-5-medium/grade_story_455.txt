<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and compelling, and the arc from disgruntled to dutiful is clear. The motivation is strong, but the "disgruntled" trait feels more like a starting premise than a deeply integrated aspect that persists or complicates the character's new-found purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally tight with a satisfying arc. However, the method "by following shadow patterns" is introduced as a key skill but is then supplanted by the coin-and-echo test for the central challenge, creating a slight incoherence in the means of corroboration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's greatest strength. The atmosphere of "inherited mystery" is palpable and masterfully sustained through specific, evocative sensory details that seamlessly merge the mundane setting of the well with the secret history beneath it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high literary quality, with rich subtext and potent symbolism (coins, water, scars). The prose is dense with original metaphor, but at times this lyrical density feels slightly overwrought, risking self-consciousness over pure narrative impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original. The story subverts the "secret legacy" trope by grounding it in the mundane reality of a well attendant, and the use of tourist coins as an acoustic key is an inventive and memorable narrative device. The voice is unique and avoids clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An excellent, cohesive piece of flash fiction where the elements serve the story, not the other way around. It demonstrates superior authorial control and leaves a lingering emotional impact. It is of immediate publishable quality, with only minor points preventing a perfect score.</comment>
