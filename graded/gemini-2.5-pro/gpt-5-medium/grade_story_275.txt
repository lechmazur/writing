<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is masterful and distinct, but the "theoretically rebellious" attribute feels asserted rather than fully demonstrated; the character’s actions read as pure discipline, making the 'rebellion' an intellectual footnote.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The fusion of the cosmic setting (burning comet) with the terrestrial (ghostly orchard) is exceptional, creating a potent, unified atmosphere of dread and hope that permeates every sentence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of "translation"—of light, silence, memory—is sustained with extraordinary skill, elevating a simple plot into a profound meditation on patience, grief, and attentiveness.</comment>
