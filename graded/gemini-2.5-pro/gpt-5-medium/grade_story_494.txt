<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The transformation arc is clear and well-supported by the character's core attribute ("doubtfully confident"), but its swiftness feels more allegorical than psychological, a minor weakness in an otherwise strong characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in narrative economy for this length, using the central action ("authorize") as a brilliant pivot point that redefines the story's conflict and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength; every sensory detail and element of the setting—from the "prison grate" shadows to the basin of water—is meticulously crafted to serve the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, built on a foundation of dense, original metaphor ("arrogance shed its lacquer") and purposeful subtext, achieving a rare level of literary polish and thematic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While built on the familiar "master and student" trope, the story revitalizes it with highly original language and specific, surprising symbolic choices (the wedding song), successfully subverting formulaic expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is a near-flawless execution of a literary parable, with all elements braided into a cohesive and resonant whole that showcases immense control and artistry; it feels deliberate and impactful.</comment>
