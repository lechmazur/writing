<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character is a well-realized archetype, but the late introduction of the grandmother's wisdom feels slightly too convenient for reinforcing the theme, rather than emerging organically from the knight himself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc, but explicitly stating the "canvas of life" metaphor is a rare misstep into telling rather than showing, slightly weakening an otherwise subtle narrative structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are masterfully rendered and deeply integrated; the setting isn't just a backdrop but an active participant in the plot. Sensory details are specific and potent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high literary quality, though the prose occasionally tips towards being overwrought. A simile like "lizards blinked like terse priests" momentarily draws attention to the writing itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept is brilliantly original, wedding astronomy to architecture. However, the consistent, elevated lyricism, while beautiful, can feel like a stylistic template for "mythic fiction" rather than a wholly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a seamless and resonant whole. It is a memorable, artful vignette, a breath away from flawless execution.</comment>
