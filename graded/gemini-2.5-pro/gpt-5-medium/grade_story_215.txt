<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's voice is superb and the late-story reveal of their true motivation is powerful, but the "exorcist" label feels slightly superficial compared to the deeply integrated "inwardly social" attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is remarkably coherent and complete within the word count, moving from puzzle to resolution with purpose. Its primary risk is its density, which is stylistically impressive but borders on being overstuffed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's absolute triumph, blending technological and occult aesthetics with specific, evocative sensory details. The world feels tangible, unique, and perfectly suited to the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, particularly the use of fresh, purposeful metaphor and the powerful subtext linking the soldier's fate to the narrator's grief. The writing elevates a clever concept into something emotionally resonant.</comment>
