<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's motivation, rooted in the specific backstory of the singer, is both poetic and grounded. The mathematician's internal conflict is powerfully shown through the contrast between her "fluidly logical" speech and her turbulent hands, and her final, earned relaxation is a credible and moving character shift. The contradictory impulses—the need for logical proof versus the desire to be held—act simultaneously and resolve into a new state of being.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative progresses through a series of resonant images and sensory details that deepen the emotional state without forced causal links. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mathematician finds a new stasis, lands with palpable emotional cost and release. The before/after state is perfectly legible, and the entire structure serves the story's core purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary agent of change. The "drifting prism terrace" and its associated tools—the storm glass, the velvet-lined pylons—are used by the narrator to actively shape the passenger's experience. The final image, where facets of the terrace "throw pale geometry across her face," directly constrains the character's perception and charges the closure, perfectly satisfying the 9+ gate for this category. Specificity is vivid and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story handles its subtle, internal conflict with masterful control. The dominant stake—whether engineered quiet can comfort a grief that resists logic—is clear from the start. Pressure deepens beautifully under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the personal revelation about the stairwell, which shifts the terms of the conflict. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency (catalyzing comfort), and the passenger's final state shows the stake has been met with a visible, felt cost: the surrender of intellectual control for embodied peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is expertly woven through image and action, never stated. The central question of how to comfort grief is explored through the potent contrast between logic and silence, measurement and catalysis. The final image of the air holding the mathematician "without hands" provides a profound, non-literal answer to her initial problem. The story’s resonance lingers, achieving a complex emotional aftereffect without a hint of sentimentality or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is singular, poetic, and flawlessly sustained. The narrator’s perceptual signature, finely tuned to sound and its absence, defines every line and observation, creating a prose texture that is inseparable from the character. Psychic distance is perfectly controlled, and the sparse dialogue is packed with subtext. This is a masterclass in voice as a narrative engine, with a distinct rhythm that supports the story's contemplative pace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in every line. Figurative language ("cities glint like pinned insects," "logic dreaming of color") is consistently fresh and serves to build the story’s unique world and tone. The rhythm is controlled and varied, creating momentum through its cadence. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is polished to a level where it becomes invisible, fully serving the narrative's effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story's premise is highly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The synthesis of a speculative, lyrical setting with a deep, quiet exploration of human grief feels entirely fresh. Tropes are absent; instead, the story builds its unique power from a specific, non-obvious conceit—a professional comforter who works with silence itself. The vision is authentic and the result is a memorable, singular piece of fiction.</comment>
