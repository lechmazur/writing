<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of the character's profession ("labyrinth architect") with his internal crisis and motivation is exceptionally strong and poetic. However, Elena exists more as a beautiful, necessary symbol than a fully realized character in her own right.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story presents a complete and coherent emotional arc. The primary weakness is the resolution's reliance on a moment of magical realism—radioing an elevator, her reappearance—that feels slightly too convenient, even for a symbolic narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "migration pattern archive" is a brilliantly original and resonant setting, not merely a backdrop but the story's central, functioning metaphor. The atmosphere is dense, consistent, and masterfully rendered with details like "refrigerated breath."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The craft is of the highest caliber. The story is a masterclass in using dense, layered metaphor ("whales bend seaways into chords") to convey profound emotional subtext. It succeeds in being intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant simultaneously.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The piece is strikingly original in its premise and execution, avoiding cliché at every turn. The metaphors are fresh and specific, demonstrating a unique authorial voice rather than any discernible formula or template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a rare and impressive cohesion, weaving its many conceptual elements into a unified, resonant whole. It operates with the precision and intentionality of a prose poem, leaving a powerful, lingering impression.</comment>
