<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character is a well-realized archetype with a distinct voice, but lacks a discernible flaw or internal conflict, making him feel more like a symbolic vessel for the theme than a three-dimensional person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot forms a complete and coherent arc, but the central conflict (protagonist vs. the system) is resolved with very little friction or tension, making the protagonist's success feel somewhat inevitable and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully evocative, with the contrast between the police station and the planetarium serving as the story's strongest feature; however, the fascinating "end of storytelling" concept feels more like a backdrop than a fully integrated world mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The craft is exceptionally strong, defined by dense, inventive metaphor. The sheer consistency of this high literary style is impressive, though at times it risks feeling overwrought, with nearly every sentence striving for profundity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully subverts cyberpunk tropes, creating a fresh and original narrative. However, the relentlessly poetic, abstract prose can feel slightly artificial, lacking the nuanced grit or varied texture of a truly authentic human voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a seamless whole. Its primary weakness is a certain polished sterility; it is so perfectly constructed that it lacks a sense of messy, unpredictable life, holding it back from top-tier impact.</comment>
