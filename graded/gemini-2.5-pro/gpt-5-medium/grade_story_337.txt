<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The character’s voice is exceptionally distinct and their motivation is clear, but they feel more like a well-crafted archetype for the theme than a person with complex, messy humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story has a complete and well-paced arc, but the plot's central turning point relies on the extreme convenience of the oracle's appearance, which feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's most profound strength; the fusion of setting and timeframe creates a uniquely specific and deeply resonant atmosphere that is both immersive and symbolic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates exceptional cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a thematically resonant whole; it is a high-quality, memorable piece whose only flaw is a style that may be too ornate for some.</comment>
