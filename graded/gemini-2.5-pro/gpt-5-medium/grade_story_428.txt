<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's core conflict is well-realized, but motivation and attributes are stated too explicitly ("to banish doubt," "rarely authentic"), a minor weakness in an otherwise strong portrayal that could rely more on subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight, achieving a complete and satisfying narrative arc within the word limit. Using the handshake as a framing device provides excellent structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength; the ancient temple setting is not a passive backdrop but an active force, with its features (frescoes, carvings, weather) amplifying the protagonist's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious, but the prose is overwrought. The relentless density of metaphors ("cartography of refusal," "roads for fear to march upon") borders on excessive, slightly muting the emotional core with stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality by combining disparate elements (doomsday prepper, city planner, ancient temple) into a fresh, cohesive narrative that skillfully subverts the tropes associated with each.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is a powerful, cohesive whole where the assigned elements feel entirely organic. Its only flaw is a stylistic choice toward such high-density prose that it risks collapsing under its own literary weight, preventing perfection.</comment>
