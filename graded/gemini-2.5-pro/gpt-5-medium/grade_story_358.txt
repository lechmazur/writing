<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mage serves as an effective archetypal vessel for the story's theme, but lacks a personal arc or internal dimension, rendering him more of a beautifully crafted functionary than a developed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The plot is an exceptionally tight and coherent symbolic arc; every step, from the riddle's introduction to its resolution via the central action, is purposeful and logically sound within the story's mystical framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The core atmospheric tension, created by the brilliant juxtaposition of an arctic wasteland, a humid greenhouse, and ancient Egyptian heat, is the story's most powerful and memorable achievement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is an exemplary work of cohesion and literary artistry, using its constraints not as limitations but as catalysts for a deeply resonant and memorable narrative that leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
