<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is exceptionally strong and distinct, but the "we" of the partners feels like a functional afterthought rather than a developed presence, slightly undermining the communal aspect of the conclusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is masterfully compressed and achieves a complete, satisfying transformation. The pacing is nearly flawless, though the formation of the group is a bit too convenient of a shortcut.</comment>
