<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is precise and deeply felt, particularly the narrator's contradictory impulses of seeking permission while acting without it. The mother's character is powerfully rendered through spare gestures and silence, making her final approval resonant. A minor deduction is for the line, "I realize that I did it to crystallize a fleeting emotion," which feels like a moment of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly steps out of the otherwise embodied and specific interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's Accumulative/Textural structure is masterfully executed, moving from the private, sealed-off house to the public gallery. The closure unit is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the mother and narrator achieve a new, shared understanding. The cost is made explicit and felt in the line "I understand the cost of surviving without a witness," landing the ending with exceptional force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is superb, established immediately with lines like "The house exhales dust." More importantly, key objects—the mask, the letters, and especially the rocking chair—are not merely descriptive but are the central engine of the plot. The chair's final, seemingly autonomous movement acts as a kinetic sculpture that constrains the climax and charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake—gaining the mother's blessing to make trauma public—is clear and potent. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pressure intensifies beautifully through a series of deepening acceptances from the mother, from the nod toward the letters to the command to bring the chair. The final scene provides a resolution where the cost of both silence and testimony is made legible on the page, fulfilling the stake with nuance and power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken trauma and the "mirage of safety" emerges with immense power from the story's intricate symbolism and subtext. However, the piece occasionally undermines its own subtlety by explicitly naming its core concepts. The exhibition title itself, the narrator's direct explanation of it, and the mother's final summary ("danger cannot bear to be named outright") constitute a "Thematic Echo" that slightly reduces the resonance that was already earned through action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is extraordinary—poetic, specific, and sustained with a distinct perceptual signature ("a curator of residue"). The narrative stance is controlled, modulating perfectly between present action and reflective memory. The point of view is stable and effective, creating a narrator whose way of seeing the world is as compelling as the events themselves. The prose consistently serves this unique and memorable voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is ambitious and largely successful, with arresting, high-density images and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. The prose is a significant strength. A minor deduction is warranted for the sheer saturation of figurative language, which at times verges on overwriting, and for a single instance of abstract, therapeutic language ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") that feels like a slight prose artifact in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>While the theme of processing trauma through art is familiar, the execution is highly original. The specific synthesis of concepts—the ash scatterer, kintsugi mask, powdered letters as pigment, and the rocking chair as a final kinetic element—transforms the trope into something singular and unforgettable. The story demonstrates a coherent and daring artistic vision that feels inevitable in its final configuration.</comment>
