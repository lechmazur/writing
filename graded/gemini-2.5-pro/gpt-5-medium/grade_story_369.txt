<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and philosophical, but the assigned attribute "optimistically bitter" is more asserted than fully embodied; the "bitter" quality in particular feels muted and underdeveloped compared to the pervasive sense of contemplative optimism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is exceptionally coherent, using the "between two letters" framework to create a flawless and satisfying internal arc of revelation and resolution.

<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The craft is of a very high order, distinguished by consistently fresh, resonant metaphors ("gulls circled in skeptical parentheses," "slow arithmetic of meaning") that drive the story's profound subtext on purpose and surrender.</comment>
