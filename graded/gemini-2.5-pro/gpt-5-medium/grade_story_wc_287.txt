<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is a major strength. The protagonist's motivation is clear, deeply rooted in grief and legacy, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail. The central contradiction of being "wistfully pragmatic" is beautifully dramatized. The final choice is earned, but the penultimate paragraph's abstract articulation ("Protected vulnerability is not a posture but an architecture...") verges on a diagnostic label, slightly undermining the embodied emotion that precedes it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean, powerful Causal lens. The inciting incident (the last petal falls) leads directly to the protagonist's decisive action, culminating in a clear Decisive Change closure—the lighthouse is relit. This change carries a legible, felt cost related to confronting grief and embracing a new purpose. The structure is flawless for its length, with every beat building logically toward the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a character and a direct influence on the plot. Details like the harbor "like a sleeping lung" and the salt-bitten gate are vivid and purposeful. Crucially, the setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the dark harbor necessitates the action, and the relit lantern transforms the entire space. The micro-settings of the lock and lantern are handled with tactile specificity, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes are established with superb economy and clarity. The dominant stake—preventing the living from "crash[ing] on unseen jetties"—is both personal and communal, giving the private act of memorial a public weight. Pressure escalates through the physical challenges of the journey and the lock-picking. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost of moving from stasis to action is felt throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of turning grief into active care emerges organically from the central metaphor of gardening and light. The final image of rooting the beam at home is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the penultimate paragraph ("Protected vulnerability is not a posture but an architecture...") is a direct thematic statement that slightly over-articulates the story's meaning, qualifying as a "Thematic Echo" that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is the story's most defining and powerful feature. It is immediately distinct, consistent, and poetic, with a perceptual signature that filters every observation through the narrator's unique worldview. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and beautiful, modulating perfectly with the rising action without a single misstep. POV is handled with flawless control and confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is rich but rarely feels overwrought, as in the controlled, rhythmic sequence of lighting the lantern. The author avoids cliché and demonstrates a masterful command of rhythm and image. There are no notable loops, scaffold, or other prose artifacts that impede momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing familiar elements—grief, lighthouses—with the fresh and specific framework of a "fire escape gardener." This central metaphor is not ornamental; it informs the protagonist's entire worldview and actions, from reading a lock like soil to rooting light like a cutting. The result is a memorable voice and a perspective that feels entirely new.</comment>
