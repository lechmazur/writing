<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is exceptionally distinct and consistent, but they function more as a vessel for the story's potent central metaphor than as a developed individual; the stated motivation arrives late and feels slightly superimposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story presents a commendably complete and satisfying arc within the word count, though the plot's resolution relies on a slightly too-abrupt acceptance of the mystical by a scientific institution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fusion of a high-tech setting with ancient, intuitive practice creates a uniquely resonant atmosphere, masterfully supported by specific, inventive sensory details that make the world feel both strange and tangible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sustained and inventive central metaphor (seismology-as-culinary-art) is executed with exceptional craft, creating a memorable and profound narrative, marred only slightly by a late-story passage that explains its theme too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates a masterful synthesis of its disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant whole, with the brief format feeling like a deliberate and effective choice for this poetic, high-concept narrative.</comment>
