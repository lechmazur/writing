<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's voice is distinct and stylistically strong, but the "dry-witted" descriptor is interpreted as a somber, poetic precision rather than wit. The voice occasionally feels so self-consciously literary that it borders on being a construct rather than a personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is a tight, symbolic arc, but its coherence relies heavily on metaphor. The transition from a literal dance to "lists and names" is abrupt, and the pacing is so dense with imagery that it risks feeling rushed, sacrificing some narrative clarity for stylistic effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, using potent, specific sensory details to create an immersive and thematically resonant world. The connection between the setting, object, and concept is nearly flawless, though the explicit use of "haunted" is a minor shortcut.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The craft is ambitious, with powerful metaphors ("tarantella of interrogation"). However, the prose is so consistently dense that it teeters on the edge of being overwrought, risking that the style, rather than the substance, becomes the main focus. It's a high-wire act that mostly succeeds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The combination of a ritual dance, a knotted rope, and a lighthouse sentinel is highly original. While it uses the trope of a haunted space, it elevates it with a unique symbolic system and a singular voice, successfully avoiding clich√© and formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable cohesion, weaving its assigned elements into a purposeful whole. Its brevity feels deliberate and impactful. The only significant critique is that its polish is so high, its language so consistently ornate, that it can feel more like a technical exercise than a raw, emotional narrative.</comment>
