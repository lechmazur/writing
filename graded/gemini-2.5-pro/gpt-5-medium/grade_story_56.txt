<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is exceptionally well-crafted and distinct. However, the conversion from cynical swindler to aspiring steward, while emotionally resonant, occurs with a speed that borders on narrative convenience, slightly undermining the established character's hardened nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkably complete and satisfying arc within a tight word count. While the "meet-cute" via a dropped item is a common trope, its execution is elevated by context, serving as an effective and efficient catalyst for the central conflict and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The world-building is the story's most brilliant element.

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The prose is of the highest caliber, dense with fresh, purposeful metaphors and potent symbolism (the price tag, the seed stone). The narrative operates on multiple levels, delivering a powerful theme with subtext and emotional depth that lingers. Craft is nearly perfect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates profound originality, particularly in its central conceit and poetic voice. It skillfully avoids clich√© by reframing a redemption arc within a unique, speculative context, resulting in a narrative that feels singular and authored, not algorithmically generated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>This is a masterclass in flash fiction, where every element serves a precise narrative and thematic purpose.
