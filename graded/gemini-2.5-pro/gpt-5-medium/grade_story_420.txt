<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character serves primarily as a conduit for poetic observation; their psychological depth is sacrificed for a strong but singular narrative voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is an internal meditation with an anemic external progression; the conflict's resolution feels unearned and sudden after a long stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph; the fusion of the museum's hush, the fossil's weight, and the internal silence is masterfully rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The literary craft is exceptional, with resonant imagery and subtext, yet the sheer density of metaphor occasionally threatens to overwhelm the narrative itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The metaphors are fresh and the voice is distinct, but the unrelenting lyricism creates its own stylistic formula, bordering on self-indulgence and feeling overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is ambitious and cohesive, but its brilliance in prose and atmosphere does not fully compensate for a static plot and a character who remains secondary to the imagery.</comment>
