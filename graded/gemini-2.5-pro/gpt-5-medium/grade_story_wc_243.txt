<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archivist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Their voice-driven interiority is potent, though the character can feel more like a beautiful, well-defined archetype than a person with contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The "haunted euphoria" is a compelling label but is described more than it is dramatized through difficult micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density toward a resonant closure (Charged Poise) that lands with palpable cost. The structure is clean and orientation is immediate. However, the plot's resolution hinges on the man's arrival—a significant coincidence that, while poetically fitting, strains the causal integrity of the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exemplary. The setting is not merely a backdrop but a central mechanism of the plot. The jetty becomes a physical medium for memory, with specific details like the "same rail, the same rust" directly constraining the characters' actions and charging the final, resonant image of regeneration. Every sensory detail serves the story's emotional and thematic core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central stake—whether a broken covenant can be repaired—is clear and compelling. Pressure deepens effectively through the accumulation of memory. While the final resolution is emotionally potent, the external conflict is resolved by the man's convenient appearance, which lessens the impact of the woman's agency and feels more like luck than an earned outcome derived from her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of small moments constituting the true weight of a relationship is developed with masterful subtlety. It emerges organically from the plot's central conceit ("proximate causes") rather than through exposition. The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that reweights the entire story beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is the story's defining strength: a highly distinct, consistent, and controlled lyricism that shapes every perception. The prose possesses a clear rhythmic and lexical signature that is sustained even under emotional pressure. While intensely stylized, it remains a coherent and powerful artistic choice throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, but its reliance on dense figurative language borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which, while often beautiful, creates a uniform texture that can slightly dull the emotional immediacy of key moments. The craft is high, but the density becomes a noticeable artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a "walnut-ink archivist" who ritually preserves memories is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The story transforms the familiar reunion trope into a philosophical exploration of memory and connection. Its ingenuity is slightly undercut by the climactic coincidence, a conventional device in an otherwise fresh narrative.</comment>
