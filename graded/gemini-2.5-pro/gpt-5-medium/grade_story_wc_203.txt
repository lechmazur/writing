<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the unique worldview of his profession. Interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the tension between "duty and curiosity," which is resolved through a choice that feels earned. The character's competence is balanced by the genuine mystery, and his final action aligns perfectly with his established desire to "keep the living honest," showing a meaningful change with a felt cost (carrying the "receipt").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens flawlessly. It builds atmosphere and knowledge through accumulated details, leading to a decisive, causal climax. The closure—a Decisive Change where the narrator unwinds the mainspring—lands with palpable on-page consequences and a clear conceptual cost. The structure is elegant and economical, with every beat logically progressing from the last toward this powerful resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and function. Every detail, from the cracked smiles on the facade to the sagging ceiling tiles and the patterns in the dust, is purposeful and integrated into the plot. The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary tool of investigation and the source of conflict. The ceiling grid as a "map of trapped promises" is a perfect example of setting constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central stake—balancing a metaphysical debt—is established with subtlety and escalates beautifully. The discovery of the mainspring provides a meaningful tightening, transforming the conflict from a mere investigation into a moral choice with clear consequences. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution entirely, and the cost is made tangible when he takes the mainspring barrel, accepting the burden of the story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of debt—temporal, monetary, and moral—is explored with remarkable depth and originality. The central metaphor of time as currency is executed brilliantly through the mainspring and watch crowns. The final image of the settling dust provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The line about turning debts into stories verges on direct statement but is so well-integrated into the character's voice that it enhances rather than detracts from the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is the story's most outstanding feature: it is singular, poetic, and utterly convincing. The protagonist's perceptual signature, viewing the world through gravity, dust, and structural secrets, is distinct and consistently maintained. The prose has a specific rhythm and texture that elevates the narrative from a simple ghost story into literary fiction, demonstrating exceptional control over psychic distance and tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is immaculate, with high information density and powerful, precise imagery in every sentence. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax and rhythm are varied to match the pacing of the investigation and discovery. Figurative language, such as the office squatting "like a peeled knuckle," is original and effective, consistently serving the story's atmosphere and themes without ever feeling overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is highly original, combining a blue-collar profession with supernatural investigation in a way that feels both grounded and mythic. The story transforms the familiar haunted-place trope through its unique mechanics of dust-reading and time-debt. The central concept of the mainspring barrel as a payroll clock is an ingenious turn that makes the resolution feel both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
