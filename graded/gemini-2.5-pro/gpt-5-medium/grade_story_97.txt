<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character’s voice is distinct and the motivation is poignantly clear, but the "fact-minded" trait feels asserted rather than demonstrated; the narration is almost purely lyrical, creating a slight dissonance with this core attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a complete and coherent emotional arc within the word count, driven by a clear, albeit surreal, internal logic. The resolution, where the dimension settles post-epiphany, feels a little too tidy for the preceding complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world and atmosphere are the story's triumph. The "unstable dimension" is realized through a cascade of specific, original, and resonant imagery that perfectly externalizes the story's themes of grief and subjective reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The craft is exceptional, using a dense tapestry of metaphor as its primary narrative engine. This creates profound subtext and emotional impact, though its sheer density is a bold stylistic choice that borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exhibits profound originality in nearly every aspect, from the core conceit of a loss-calibrated compass to the "child made of bird calls." The metaphors are fresh and specific, creating a narrative voice that is unique and avoids all cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A stylistically stunning and cohesive piece where the assigned elements are masterfully woven into a poignant theme. It is nearly flawless, held back only by the minor narrative friction of a key character trait that feels more stated than earned.</comment>
