<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The character’s voice is exceptionally distinct and poetic, and the 'stage fright' is powerfully linked to the fear of speaking a buried truth. The re-contextualization of 'exorcist' into a compassionate, guiding role is a significant strength, though it relies on the reader accepting this new definition without question.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is remarkably complete and well-paced for its length. The only minor fragility is the speed of the protagonist's deductive leap from the ghost's whisper to the locket's contents; it's an elegant narrative shortcut, but one that slightly prioritizes momentum over procedural discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's triumph. The juxtaposition of vast, silent orbital debris with the intimate, delicate act of toy assembly creates a powerful and unique mood. The world-building is evocative through implication ("confiscated worlds"), successfully creating a sense of history without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The craft is flawless. The story operates on a profound level of subtext and metaphor, with every element—the key, the lock, the toy, the flowers—serving a symbolic purpose. The emotional resonance of the final reveal and the theme of breaking generational silence are executed with a mastery rarely seen in this format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, blending sci-fi, ghost-lore, and intimate family drama into a new whole. The metaphors are fresh and specific ("starlight trapped in frost"), and the emotional landscape is nuanced and shown through action and internal thought, not stated. The narrative voice is singular and confident.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>This piece demonstrates exceptional cohesion; the assigned elements are not merely included but are indivisible from the story's core. They are woven together to create a narrative that is dense, purposeful, and feels far larger than its word count. The brevity is a deliberate artistic choice that amplifies its impact.</comment>
