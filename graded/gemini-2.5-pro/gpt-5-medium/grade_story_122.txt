<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The characters exist as archetypes to serve the story’s symbolism rather than as developed individuals; their motivations are grand but lack psychological interiority, making them vessels for the theme rather than relatable figures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is a single, highly compressed ritualistic act. While its allegorical cause-and-effect is internally consistent and the arc is complete, the stakes remain abstract, which lessens the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story’s greatest strength is its world and atmosphere; the sky burial site is rendered with exceptional, specific sensory details that create a powerful, unique, and utterly transportive mood of mythic futurism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The craft is immensely skillful, but the sheer density of metaphor and poetic language, while often brilliant, borders on being overwritten, occasionally prioritizing stylistic flourish over narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of disparate concepts (cybernetics, mysticism, meteorology) is highly original, and the authorial voice is distinct and confident, creating a fresh mythos that avoids cliché entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece is a masterfully cohesive and impactful prose poem, but its focus on symbolic grandeur over character-driven emotion makes it a challenging narrative that one admires for its artistry more than feels, a potential barrier for publication.</comment>
