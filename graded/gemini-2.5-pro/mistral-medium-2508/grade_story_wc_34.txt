<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in the legacy of his grandmother and his intrinsic nature as one who "hears what others don't." The final choice is a potent renunciation, a crystallization of his values where he prioritizes self-preservation over the overwhelming need of the other. The internal conflict between his duty to translate silence and the horrifying cost of this specific translation is embodied perfectly in the climax, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses leading to an earned, costly choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive that builds pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail, culminating in a clean, Causal closure. The final act—slamming the bolt plate—is a Decisive Change that simultaneously serves as a Conceptual Repricing, as the ghost isn't destroyed but disseminated. The cost is legible in his "throat raw with words he’d never sing," making the ending both conclusive and resonant, fully satisfying the requirements for a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, with the mist coiling "tighter around his ankles" and the graffiti "ripping" the stone. The flower press bolt plate serves as a perfect micro-setting, a tangible object that channels the conflict, growing "warm as a living pulse." This integration of environment and tool to constrain choice and charge the final image is exemplary and easily clears the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story masterfully handles its single, dominant stake. The conflict escalates with chilling precision from a compassionate inquiry ("What do you need?") to a direct existential threat ("It wanted out. ... Into him."). This single, decisive tightening is driven by the protagonist's agency and forces a high-stakes choice with a clear, felt cost, demonstrating an impeccable understanding of narrative pressure within a compressed form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme is woven into the story's fabric through the elegant parallel between pressing flowers into "silent poetry" and encoding symbols into stone. The story explores the weight of unspoken needs and the limits of empathy without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of the child offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem—the work is never done—that powerfully reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive, confident, and sustained, establishing a lyrical and melancholic tone from the opening line. The point of view remains tightly controlled, filtering every sensory detail through the balladeer's unique perceptual signature ("the ghost of rain that never quite fell"). The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the rising tension, demonstrating a high level of authorial control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high information density, striking figurative language ("a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby"), and a controlled, evocative rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build atmosphere or advance the plot. The line-level craft is precise and powerful, particularly in the high-pressure climax, where clarity and propulsion are maintained without sacrificing texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is highly original, blending ancient folklore archetypes (the balladeer) with modern conceptual metaphors (a ghost *in code*, a courtyard like a "forgotten server room"). This synthesis feels fresh and inevitable, transforming the familiar ghost-whisperer trope into something unique. The resolution, which favors continuation and transformation over simple vanquishing, is a bold and intellectually satisfying choice that elevates the entire piece.</comment>
