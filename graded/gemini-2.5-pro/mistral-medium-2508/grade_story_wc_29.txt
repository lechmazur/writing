<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict—"her caution warring with the hope"—is perfectly dramatized through her actions. Her competence is balanced with the palpable professional and existential risks she undertakes. The character’s arc from isolated observer to active participant is earned, culminating in a final assertion of agency that feels both inevitable and resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, propulsive causal chain under a Causal lens, leading to a superb Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the close. The ending redefines Liora's situation with palpable cost and tension. The campus-wide effect of the signal faltering is slightly convenient in its speed and uniformity, a minor contrivance in an otherwise flawless structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a standout success; the forgotten radio station is not mere background but a crucial enabler of the plot, providing both the sanctuary and the tools for Liora’s rebellion. Sensory details are specific, selective, and filtered perfectly through the POV’s focus on sound and data. The atmosphere of "ethereal grit" is established immediately and sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story signals its dominant stake—proving agency against an inscrutable power—early and escalates it through a single, decisive turn driven by the protagonist. Liora’s choice to interfere is a fantastic pivot that transforms the conflict from observation to interaction. The cost is felt in the physiological pressure and the impending professional confrontation, making the climax potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the potent parallel between cosmic manipulation and university politics. The story resists easy answers, ending on a note of tense curiosity rather than simple victory. The final image of Liora at the dial provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about communication and agency, though the internal thought "proving they weren’t pawns" borders on being overly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The point of view is masterfully controlled, with a distinct and consistent narrative voice that reflects Liora’s professional expertise and emotional state. Her perceptual signature, tuned to signals and patterns, makes the world feel specific and authentic. The brief dialogue is sharp, character-distinct, and loaded with subtext, exemplifying high-level control of voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive from the fantastic opening line onward. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, while sentence rhythm modulates effectively with the scene's tension. The piece is remarkably free of clutter or loops, though a couple of common phrases ("building's bones," "held its breath") represent minor, hairline flaws in an otherwise impeccable execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of academic satire and a "first contact" scenario, transforming familiar tropes into something fresh and intellectually engaging. The central concept of a signal that participates in social fractures is ingenious and explored with conceptual integrity. The choice to resolve the confrontation into a "curious" conversation is a sophisticated and memorable turn.</comment>
