<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (outshining lights) feels slightly grandiose and abstract for the 'bleak' persona initially; the internal transformation, while present, feels compressed within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the resolution (mastery and shift in outlook) feels somewhat rapid and tidy for the established despair, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric creation through the unique setting and effective use of the 'absurd' clock; sensory details are generally evocative, enhancing the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (clock, rock) and a clear theme emerge, but the narrative relies slightly too much on stating emotions ('despair', 'ache') rather than consistently showing them through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept is original, avoiding major clich√©s, but some phrasing leans towards the ornate ("celestial wonder") and emotional portrayal could achieve greater subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion achieved in integrating disparate elements; the story feels like a deliberate, complete vignette despite its brevity and constraints.</comment>
