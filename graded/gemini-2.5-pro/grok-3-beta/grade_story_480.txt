<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'social media exorcist' concept is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation ('curiosity') is stated rather than deeply shown, and the 'quietly loud' attribute feels more like a label than a fully integrated character trait demonstrated through nuanced action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (clue -> infiltration -> encounter -> departure) within the word limit. The receipt effectively drives the action, but the transition from music hall to mess hall feels slightly abrupt, weakening the initial setup's connection to the core narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere of abandonment (music hall, mess hall, alley) effectively mirrors the theme of online isolation and the 'familiar strangers' concept. Sensory details like dust, moonlight, and whispered confessions enhance the mood, though the initial music hall setting feels somewhat disconnected from the main action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses evocative imagery ("digital ghosts," "receipt... listing... despair") and explores the relevant theme of online vs. offline connection. The ending is suitably ambiguous, but the overall emotional impact is somewhat muted by the protagonist's detachment, leaving the central conflict's resolution feeling slight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept ('social media exorcist,' 'familiar strangers') offers originality, but the prose occasionally relies on slightly predictable phrasing ("algorithm's cold grip," "haunted eyes") and stated emotions rather than consistently showing nuanced human reactions, bordering on stylized detachment that can feel formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements cohesively, particularly the object, concept, and setting. However, the initial timeframe feels extraneous, and the character's unique profession isn't fully leveraged, making the piece feel slightly more like a concept sketch than a fully realized narrative despite its evocative atmosphere.</comment>
