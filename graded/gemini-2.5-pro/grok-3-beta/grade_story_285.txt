<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and awkwardness are stated but not deeply embodied or revealed through unique action; the 'swordsman' aspect feels incidental rather than integral. Motivation is present but lacks nuanced exploration within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc (hesitation to action), but the hermit crab method feels overly symbolic and explained, rather than a natural plot device. The timeframe trigger ("final piece of evidence filed away") is abstract and weakly integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and effectively used to mirror internal conflict (ice/steam). However, the assigned tone ("ephemeral rancor") feels poorly integrated, almost an afterthought, clashing with the dominant mood of hesitant obligation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (hermit crabs, postcard) is present but heavy-handed, with meanings explicitly stated rather than subtly implied. While there's a clear theme, the craft relies too much on telling emotions and significance, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Language veers towards purple prose ("ephemeral rancor," "ancestral obligation") and relies on stating emotions. The hermit crab metaphor explanation and predictable character arc feel somewhat formulaic, lacking unique authorial voice or surprising insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but the synthesis feels mechanical rather than organic; they seem assembled rather than emerging naturally from the narrative. Cohesion is surface-level, lacking the seamless integration expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
