<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character feels underdeveloped; "nondescript seer" is vague, "analytically innovative" clashes with the intuitive scent method, and "innocent cynicism" is stated rather than convincingly portrayed through action or internal thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from the contrived scent-memory decryption mechanism and the poorly integrated "surprise party" timeframe, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned despite a clear beginning-middle-end structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower setting effectively creates isolation and decay, enhancing the mood, but the "after party" timeframe feels disconnected and adds little atmospheric value.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Craft is competent but lacks distinction; relies too heavily on telling emotions/traits ("cynicism softened," "analytically innovative") and the central theme of delayed justice is delivered without significant subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The core scent-memory decryption method feels like an artificial construct to solve the plot, bordering on clich√© (mystical insight). Phrasing occasionally dips into generic territory ("shattered countless lives," "ghostly echoes"). Lacks a truly unique voice or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is weak; the required elements (especially the timeframe and the clash between 'analytical' and 'scent method') feel forced together rather than emerging organically from a unified narrative vision.</comment>
