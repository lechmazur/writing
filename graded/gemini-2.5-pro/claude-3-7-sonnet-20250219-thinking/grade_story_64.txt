<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The 'uncertain alchemist' and 'technically wild' attributes are stated but barely demonstrated; his actions stem more from weariness with immortality than any specific alchemical uncertainty or wildness. Motivation (mapping) feels slightly disconnected from the core internal conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, using the trial as a frame and the coded floor as a device. However, the connection between the stated crime (mapping) and the ultimate resolution (surrendering immortality) feels somewhat tenuous and convenient rather than deeply causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating marketplace setting is intriguing and visually interesting, providing a unique backdrop. However, the 'mundane miracles' tone is asserted more than evoked, lacking consistent, deep sensory detail to fully establish the intended atmosphere beyond a few examples.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story touches on the familiar theme of immortality's burden and uses the coded floor as decent symbolism. The ending offers closure, but the overall impact is muted by predictability and a lack of profound subtext or truly striking literary craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt AI tells like repetitive phrasing, the story relies heavily on the established trope of immortality being a curse, and the secret-code-escape-route feels somewhat generic. It lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising interpretation of the elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story integrates the required elements competently, achieving basic cohesion. However, several elements (alchemist, wild methods, mapping motivation) feel somewhat superficially attached rather than emerging organically from the core narrative need, slightly weakening the overall impact.</comment>
