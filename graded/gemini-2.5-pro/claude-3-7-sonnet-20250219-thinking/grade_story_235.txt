<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters serve the concept well, particularly Miyako, whose actions align with her role and the 'dramatically subtle' attribute. However, Takeda remains somewhat opaque, defined more by his function in the communication than by intrinsic depth. Their motivations are clear but lack complex internal conflict within this snapshot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is elegant and coherent within the word limit, effectively using the 'reposition' action. The beginning, middle, and anticipated end form a clear arc. The pacing is well-managed. The meteor decoding mechanism, while central, borders on contrivance without stronger grounding, slightly weakening perfect logical flow for a demanding literary standard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reimagined castle setting and summer timeframe effectively create a backdrop for the 'distant intimacy' tone. Atmosphere is strong, particularly the contrast between the public academy and private communication (moonlit garden). Sensory details are present, though could be slightly sharper or more unique to achieve true distinction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (flowers, book, meteors) and subtext creates significant depth. The story evokes a poignant mood and explores themes of time, memory, and unspoken connection effectively. The central tension is subtle but palpable. 'Showing' is generally preferred over 'telling'. The ending feels earned and resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept and communication method offer strong originality. The prose is generally refined and avoids obvious AI tells or excessive clich√©s. While elegant, the style doesn't push boundaries radically. The emotional nuance feels authentic, though the meteor element slightly strains suspension of disbelief without a clearer genre signal (e.g., magical realism).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive cohesion, integrating the assigned elements seamlessly in service of the narrative. The brevity feels appropriate for this focused vignette. It successfully cultivates a specific mood and leaves the reader with a lingering sense of quiet anticipation and the weight of unspoken history.</comment>
