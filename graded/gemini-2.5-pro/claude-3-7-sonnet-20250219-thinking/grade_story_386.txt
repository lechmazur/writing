<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Nara's motivation ("For the Empire," "bind old wounds") feels somewhat generic and is stated rather than deeply felt. The 'trustworthy strange' attribute is mentioned but not substantially demonstrated through action or interaction beyond whispers and Morgan's acceptance. Her actions align, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is clear (setup, action, resolution) and coherent within the word limit. However, the resolution—an immediate, perfectly placed response capsule—feels overly convenient, undermining the stated difficulty ("impossible distance," "defiance of physics") and the tension built over years of waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the atom-powered lighthouse and Nara's lost empire is effective. The timeframe ("hush of a line that never moves") enhances the mood. However, sensory details ("hummed," "crystalline resonance") lack the specificity needed for truly deep immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (tablecloth, lighthouse beam). It evokes loneliness and hope. However, the emotional impact of the ending is lessened by its convenience. The dialogue is functional but minimal. The central conflict is clear, but its resolution feels slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story combines familiar sci-fi tropes (time refugee, message across time) competently but lacks striking originality. While avoiding obvious AI tells like inconsistent tone or logic jumps, the prose is capable rather than exceptional, and metaphors ("sea of time") are functional but not particularly fresh. Emotional beats are stated ("hands trembled," "genuine smile") rather than fully evoked through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The assigned elements are integrated reasonably well, creating a cohesive vignette. However, the story feels somewhat constrained by the elements rather than organically growing from them. The brevity works, but the narrative arc, particularly the resolution, feels slightly thin and predictable for top-tier publication.</comment>
