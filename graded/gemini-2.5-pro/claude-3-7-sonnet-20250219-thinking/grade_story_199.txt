<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tomas's motivation is clear (legacy, goddess echo), but his defining trait "overzealous" is stated rather than deeply demonstrated through action or consequence. His internal landscape remains somewhat unexplored beyond his singular focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc (routine -> mystery -> revelation) within the word limit. However, the climax relies heavily on exposition from the new character rather than Tomas's active discovery through his established methods.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The unique setting (urban orchard, post-dream) is evocative and strongly integrated with the concept and atmosphere. Sensory details effectively establish the mood, though perhaps could be even more uniquely tied to the 'post-dream' state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully uses symbolism (notebook, orchard) and builds intrigue. The ending provides a conceptual reveal, but the mechanism (words appearing magically) feels slightly convenient and less impactful than a more earned discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core concept is original and avoids major clich√©s. However, the final explanation delivered by the old woman is quite direct, bordering on info-dumping, which lessens the nuance. Some phrasing feels slightly ornate ("rhythms that defied the sun's trajectory").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves strong cohesion, integrating the assigned elements effectively into a unified narrative. The concept feels central, and the brief length works for this vignette style, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
