<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from aloofness feels abrupt and insufficiently motivated within the word count; Merina remains somewhat archetypal, defined more by her past trauma than nuanced present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on convenient coincidences (the delay, the perfectly timed arrival and offer from the director), undermining the established realism and making the resolution feel overly neat and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere established through the port setting and seasonal timeframe, but the 'labyrinth' aspect serves more as evocative backdrop than an active, dynamic influence on the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Relies on telling the theme explicitly in the conclusion ("blueprints of healing") rather than purely showing; the emotional resonance is slightly dampened by narrative convenience and somewhat self-conscious phrasing like "innovative nostalgia".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While possessing some originality in setting, the central emotional arc (isolated individuals connect and heal via a shared project) follows familiar patterns, and the prose lacks a truly unique, inimitable authorial signature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Achieves cohesion but feels constrained by its neatness, sacrificing potential depth for resolution; not all assigned elements (notably Elias's 'odd' rituals) feel deeply integrated or essential to the core narrative.</comment>
