<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The 'amiable' trait is underdeveloped and largely asserted rather than shown; the character primarily functions as a plot device whose motivation, while clear, lacks deep emotional resonance or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but relies on the somewhat convenient device of the crossword cipher and follows a predictable 'vindicated lone researcher' trajectory, lacking significant tension or surprise within the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting effectively enhances the atmosphere and concept, integrating sensory details like vibrations and flickering light, though it leans on familiar haunted tropes rather than forging truly unique imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (shadows, crossword) but lacks subtlety; the theme of the past speaking is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically. The central conflict resolves neatly but without profound impact or lingering questions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the core concept (communicating timbers) holds originality, the execution feels somewhat generic, employing standard narrative beats (dismissed academic, sudden validation) and lacking a distinctive authorial style or truly fresh metaphorical language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates the assigned elements, but feels somewhat constructed *around* them, hindering organic flow. It achieves cohesion but lacks the exceptional spark or depth required for the highest literary echelon.</comment>
