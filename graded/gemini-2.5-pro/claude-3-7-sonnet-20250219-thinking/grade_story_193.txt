<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Aldrin's shift from exiled bitterness to purposeful healer feels abrupt, lacking nuanced exploration. Elara serves primarily as a catalyst rather than a fully developed character. Motivation is stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on the convenient snowstorm encounter. The symbolic key moment feels somewhat forced. While a complete arc exists, the resolution feels rushed within the word count, compressing significant change into a brief summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and blizzard effectively establish a melancholic, isolated atmosphere. The setting and the mortar/pestle are well-connected, enhancing the theme of finding purpose in forgotten places. Sensory details are present but could be more evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (mortar/pestle, key). The theme of finding purpose over reclaiming status is clear and resonant. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by telling rather than showing, and the dialogue is functional but lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies significantly on familiar tropes (exiled royal finding redemption in service, chance encounter in a storm) without substantial subversion. The language is competent but lacks a unique stylistic signature, occasionally using clich√©s ("chill in his soul"). Feels predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story integrates most elements adequately, particularly the setting and object. However, some elements like "unseen forces" feel superficially addressed. The narrative serves the elements, but the overall execution lacks the depth and originality expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
