<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character is a functional archetype for the allegory but lacks psychological depth; core traits like "optimistically bitter" and her motivation are explicitly stated rather than convincingly demonstrated through action or a unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot forms a coherent allegorical arc, but the pacing is rushed, and the resolution feels too sudden and simplistic. The cause-and-effect logic operates on a purely symbolic level, which can feel mechanically convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength. The lighthouse setting is powerfully evocative and perfectly integrated with the central theme of isolation and introspection, creating a potent, immersive atmosphere that carries the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The craft is heavy-handed; the story is saturated with metaphors that, while consistent, are not particularly novel. It suffers from telling key emotional and psychological states, and the neat allegorical resolution lacks lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The writing borders on purple prose, and the allegorical structure is so perfectly executed that it feels artificial and programmatic. The metaphors are overworked, and the narrative follows a predictable therapeutic arc without offering a fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive to a fault, feeling more like a well-oiled machine built from its assigned elements than an organic narrative. Its intellectual neatness comes at the cost of emotional authenticity, limiting its overall impact.</comment>
