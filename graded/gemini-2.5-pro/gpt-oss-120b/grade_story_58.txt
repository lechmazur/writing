<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "fiercely loyal scout" attribute is asserted but never demonstrated or integrated, remaining a disconnected label that adds nothing to the character's believable substance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear internal arc, but the plot's central method—the "comedic routines"—is presented as exposition rather than enacted, weakening its dynamic impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength; the synthesis of the moth tower, the blackout, and the "sanctified dread" tone creates a potent and memorable mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece shows strong literary craft with its imagery, but undermines its own sophistication by occasionally explaining its symbolism ("a visual echo of her inner conflict"), failing to trust the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central premise is unique, but the execution slips into formula by repetitively hammering keywords like "radicalize" and "sanctified," which feels more like fulfilling a prompt than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is impressively cohesive, yet a discerning reader can still see the seams of its construction from disparate elements; it reads like a masterful exercise, but not an organically conceived narrative.</comment>
