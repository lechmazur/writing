<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlowe’s motivation is clear and his internal shift from isolated observer to purposeful guardian is well-earned. However, his characterization as "eccentric" is more of a label than a demonstrated trait, and his interiority sometimes uses overt thematic statements ("loneliness not as emptiness but as a canvas") instead of fully embodied emotion, slightly reducing the impact of his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The main structural weakness is the central investigative method—reading memories in the tide's gaps—which feels like an unearned poetic leap. While fitting the tone, this conceit strains causality and makes the pivotal discovery feel more magical than earned through observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, moving beyond mere backdrop to become a central mechanism of the plot. The "opal dock in mist" and the rhythm of the tide are not just atmospheric but are integral to the character's actions and internal state. The setting directly constrains Marlowe's method and charges the final, resonant image of the lighthouse beam tracing the water's gaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear internal stake—Marlowe's need to find connection within his isolation—and deepens it effectively. The pressure is accumulative, intensifying as Marlowe's interpretation of the flower and tide gains meaning. The final choice to create a beacon provides a clear resolution with a legible, felt cost: his loneliness is not erased but transformed into a purposeful, comforting duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of memory, connection, and purposeful solitude is handled with subtlety and grace. The theme emerges organically from the central images of the Edelweiss, the tide, and the light, culminating in a powerful final image that answers the story's central question without resorting to moralizing. The connection between the alpine flower and the sea provides a consistent, resonant tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Marlowe's perceptions. However, the voice occasionally slips into a register that feels more like a generic "fine writing" style than the specific perceptual signature of this particular lighthouse keeper, slightly distancing the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While often evocative, the prose suffers from overwriting and repetition. The key phrase "softly persistent" is used four times, and "borrowed memory" three times, dulling their impact. The density of figurative language in some passages feels excessive, and a few adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, creating slight momentum drag that undercuts the otherwise strong rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story takes the familiar trope of the lonely lighthouse keeper and infuses it with an original, poetic conceit. The central method of reading the tides is a fresh and memorable idea. Combining the landlocked Edelweiss with the maritime setting creates a unique and effective central symbol, elevating the narrative beyond a conventional tale of solitude.</comment>
