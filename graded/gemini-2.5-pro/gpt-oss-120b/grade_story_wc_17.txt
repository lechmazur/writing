<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear and her arc—from solitary archivist to facilitator of a shared history—is legible. However, her interiority reads more as a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual with contradictory impulses. The transformation of her "legacy's burden" feels more like a smooth intellectual realization than a choice born from tangible internal conflict, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, layering discoveries to build toward a Conceptual Repricing of the central "legacy." The closure lands effectively, redefining the protagonist's burden. The structure is slightly weakened by the final section, which summarizes months of activity in an epilogue-like fashion, diluting the impact of the climactic moment of discovery and shifting into telling over showing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's most powerful element, with vivid, specific sensory details creating a potent sense of place. The setting is not merely descriptive; the ivy-veiled passage is the crucible for the story's events. The film negative, as a micro-setting/tool, is essential to the climax, directly constraining and enabling Lira's actions and charging the final image of communion, meeting the standard for excellence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes its dominant stake—understanding the walls' dreams—and deepens it effectively under an accumulative lens. Lira’s agency drives the discovery, and the climax provides a meaningful reweighting of her quest. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the "legacy's burden" is transformed rather than paid for, making the price of her new understanding purely conceptual and less viscerally felt than it could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of shared memory emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery, particularly the film negative. The piece achieves a resonant emotional aftereffect. However, the final line—"...the true map was not of corridors, but of the collective imagination"—borders on a "thematic echo," explicitly stating the story's moral rather than allowing the final image to convey it entirely through subtext, which slightly undermines the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story’s melancholic, mysterious tone. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Lira's focus on sound and memory. The voice modulates effectively with the intensity of the discovery, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Momentum is generally well-maintained. The score is held back by minor but noticeable artifacts, such as the redundant use of "sensitively perceptive" and label-like phrases like "haunting motivation," which feel slightly generic and break the otherwise specific texture of the prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept of an "echo cartographer" mapping the dreams of architecture is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The mechanism of using light-sensitive film to translate sound into visual shadow is an ingenious and memorable detail. While the emotional arc of accepting a burden is familiar, its application in this unique context feels fresh and authentic, representing a strong synthesis of ideas.</comment>
