<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" is clear and consistently drives his actions. The shift from a personal need to a communal promise is earned through the ritual. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into telling, as with the phrase "Marek felt a surge of purpose," which slightly undermines the otherwise strong embodiment of his character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The inciting incident (lamp dies) leads to a ritual that deepens the stakes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marek accepts his new role. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the "luminescent ache"—making the before/after state of his purpose legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the "haunted lantern room" providing immediate pressure and atmosphere. Crucially, micro-settings—the river stones and especially the sea glass—are not merely descriptive but are integral tools that constrain and enable the central ritual. The sea glass is handled, transformed, and becomes the charged object that carries the story's resolution, perfectly satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict operates on a strong, internal axis, with the dying lamp externalizing a threat to hope itself. The stake is signaled early and deepens meaningfully from Marek's personal nostalgia to a protective vow for all sailors. The protagonist's agency in performing the ritual directly confronts the pressure, and the cost is made unmistakable in the final beat as a persistent, carried ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of creating and preserving hope in darkness emerges powerfully from the central ritual. However, the story's resonance is significantly weakened by explicit thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "a simple promise that safety could be bottled and shared" and "reminding him that safety can be bottled and carried" function as overt moralizing, which feels tacked on to an otherwise subtle narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the voice possesses a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture that perfectly matches the story's tone. The narrator’s perceptual signature is specific, focusing on details of light, stone, and sea that align with Marek’s character. The prose rhythmically shifts to match the contemplative pace of the ritual without any slips in control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and demonstrates a strong command of imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels self-conscious ("trapped sunrise," "ghostly light"). The repetition of the key phrase "luminescent ache" slightly dulls its impact, and the final paragraphs contain some conceptual redundancy that could be tightened for greater momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story's core concept—a ritual to transmute personal memory into a communal beacon of hope—is highly original. It transforms the familiar trope of the lonely lighthouse into a sanctuary for collective feeling. The specific mechanism of the stone spiral as a non-physical "anonymous letter chain" is an inventive and memorable synthesis of magic realism and maritime lore.</comment>
