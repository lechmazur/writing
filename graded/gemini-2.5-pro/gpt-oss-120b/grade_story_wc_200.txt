<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s character is functional but lacks deep interior contradiction. The defining trait "modestly fearless" is stated rather than dramatized through a choice with tradeoffs. Her epiphany about laughter feels more like a convenient discovery than an earned insight rooted in a specific personal struggle, and the line "She understood her purpose" is summary that replaces embodied feeling at a key moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sorrowful atmosphere that is effectively reconfigured at the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is legible on the page. However, the causal link at the climax—a clumsy joke instantly producing transformative, collective laughter—feels slightly unearned and simplistic, softening the impact of the otherwise solid structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, functioning as an active participant in the narrative. Echo Gorge and the key objects within it—the misaligned harp and the crocodile's tooth—are not merely descriptive but constrain action and directly charge the final image. The sensory details are vivid and purposeful, creating a coherent and resonant atmosphere that is integral to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing the spirits' sorrow—is clear and intensifies effectively. The pressure builds texturally from discordant grief to an internal "luminous ache" in Mara. The climax, where her joke turns sorrow to laughter, represents a decisive deepening of her method, and the cost of her taking on the initial grief is felt. The resolution is directly tied to her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of healing through the integration of joy and sorrow is potent and emerges organically from the imagery. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis in the final third: "She understood her purpose: to pursue the broken whispers... and to integrate laughter into their healing." This moment of thematic summary undercuts the otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for the material. POV is controlled and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and light. The prose rhythm supports the mood, though a few instances of declarative interiority ("She knew," "She understood") create moments of psychic distance where immediacy would be more powerful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum rather than sharpen it. The repetition of the key phrase "luminous ache" feels slightly heavy-handed, and the final paragraph stacks resonant phrases into a "symphony" that borders on excessive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's core concept—a soul collector who uses laughter as a form of spiritual mending—is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It transforms the familiar trope of a ghost whisperer into something gentler and more psychologically nuanced. The synthesis of disparate elements like a crocodile tooth, a broken harp, and a bad joke feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
