<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority relies on conceptual labels like "cautiously hopeful surge" rather than embodied emotion. The character arc is legible, but key emotional shifts are summarized ("watched the community’s anxiety dissolve"), which keeps the character at an intellectual distance. This abstract quality prevents the characterization from achieving the highest level of visceral impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The central causality—interference creates a unifying hum that alters the community's response—is clear and elegant. The final image of the valley thrumming with a shared pulse provides a costly and earned Conceptual Repricing of the initial conflict, marking a truly publishable structural success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The university radio station is more than a backdrop; it's an essential tool and character in the narrative, constraining and enabling every key action. Details like the "dust-touched astronomical charts" ground the fantastical elements effectively. The setting's transformation from a "battlefield into a forum" and finally a "lighthouse" is integral to the story's closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central stake—community cohesion versus fracturing—is clear and consistently tested. The tricksters' false solar flare alarm provides a meaningful tightening point, where Mara’s agency directly averts disaster and demonstrates the cost of failure. While the community’s turn toward unity feels swift, it is causally linked to her actions, making the resolution earned within the story's allegorical frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of subtle influence creating unity is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. However, the narrative occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, bordering on a moral. Lines like "...power plays could be outmaneuvered when every listener tuned their own inner frequency..." and the final sentence about hope rewriting stars feel like authorial summary rather than resonant, subtextual conclusions drawn from the image itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly maintained with a stable psychic distance that suits the story’s mythic, fable-like quality. The voice is distinct, blending technical jargon with elevated, almost lyrical prose ("ethereal grit," "celestial signal interpreter") to create a memorable and consistent narrative texture. The prose itself has a clear perceptual signature rooted in Mara's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on summarizing pivotal moments instead of dramatizing them through concrete action and sensory detail. While the overall effect is strong, moments of abstraction—like describing anxiety dissolving rather than showing its effects fade—create a slight drag on momentum. The final line, while thematically consistent, lands as a platitude that somewhat dulls the otherwise sharp ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—using subsonic frequencies as a form of social and psychic defense against cosmic manipulators—is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The story cleverly transforms a hostile act ("interfere") into a unifying one, subverting typical conflict tropes. The expansion of the technique from a single station to a valley of household appliances is an ingenious and grounded development that elevates the entire concept.</comment>
