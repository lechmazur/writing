<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character’s transition from “distracted” to “almost radical resolve” is abrupt and unearned, making Corin feel less like a developed personality and more like a functional automaton for the plot's symbolic needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot functions as a neat, self-contained allegory, but its internal logic relies entirely on magical assertion rather than earned narrative development. The resolution feels more like a switch being flipped than a consequential outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The initial establishment of the “infernal kitchen” is a significant strength, creating a potent, sensory atmosphere. However, this atmosphere becomes subordinate to the story's abstract, conceptual mechanics as it progresses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story suffocates under the weight of its own symbolism. It repeatedly tells the reader its theme (“the price of forgiveness was paid”) instead of trusting the imagery to convey meaning, resulting in a piece that feels preachy rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The repetitive use of the exact phrase “abrasive calm” is a critical flaw, betraying a formulaic approach to prose. This, combined with consistently overwrought language, reads as an attempt at a literary style rather than a genuine authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The narrative feels transparently constructed to accommodate its assigned elements, rather than using them to serve an organic story. The lack of subtlety and the mechanical repetition of key phrases make it unsuitable for publication at a high level.</comment>
