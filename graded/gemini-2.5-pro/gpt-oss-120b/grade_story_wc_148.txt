<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The boy's motivation is split between a clear, compelling need for redemption and an overly abstract, authorial statement ("to thread a labyrinth with your own story"). While his actions are consistent, his interiority feels more like a vessel for the story's poetic concepts than a site of genuine, contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective, building a lyrical and symbolic sequence toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with a legible, felt cost as the boy reframes his identity rather than escaping it. Causality operates coherently within the story's magical realist rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and the story's strongest element. The lighthouse prison is a vivid, atmospheric crucible that actively shapes the mood and action. The recurring object of the lattice functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and directly charges the climax and final image, meeting the highest standard for integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming a legacy of false warnings—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The key turn, realizing his purpose is to guide others rather than save himself, provides a meaningful escalation of purpose. The resolution is earned, and the cost of accepting his past is clear in the final shift to peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming a flawed legacy into a guiding truth is well-integrated and avoids a simplistic moral. However, a few lines, like "every warning is a thread, not a wall," veer close to explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise resonant subtext. The final image of the lighthouse as a beacon is powerful, if a touch heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct and consistently maintained, creating a fable-like quality. The point of view is controlled without any slips. The only weakness is a slight register mismatch; the sophisticated syntax and vocabulary feel more authorial than character-bound, creating a distance from the boy's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is marred by significant text artifacts that disrupt momentum. Verbatim repetition of long phrases ("through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades") and key terms ("copperlight repose," "sustains impossibilities") reads as mechanical looping, not purposeful refrain. This, combined with an overly dense application of figurative language, demonstrates a lack of concision and polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cry-wolf archetype with a gothic, magical-realist prison setting is fresh and compelling. The story builds a memorable atmosphere. However, the originality of the concept is let down by an execution that feels formulaic in its prose, particularly the repetitive phrasing, which prevents the piece from feeling truly singular and surprising.</comment>
