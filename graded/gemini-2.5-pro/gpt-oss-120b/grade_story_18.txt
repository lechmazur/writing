<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the core concept is unique, the execution suffers from a formulaic repetition of the generating prompts, making the piece feel more like a technical exercise than an organic work of fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkable cohesion of its elements, but this tightness feels constricting and artificial, failing to transcend the visible framework of its constraints for publication.</comment>
