<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character acts consistently with the 'quietly rebellious' trait and motivation, but lacks deep internal complexity or a distinct voice, feeling more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent with a clear arc using the 'shape' action effectively, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt and overstated within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strongly evoked through the setting and timeframe, supporting the concept well; however, some descriptions lean towards generic poeticism and the 'grit' aspect of the tone is less developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism and atmosphere effectively to explore its theme, but the emotional impact relies heavily on established light/dark tropes and the ending feels somewhat easily achieved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While avoiding major AI tells, the narrative relies on familiar symbolic language ("wounded star," "spark in the dark") and a somewhat predictable hopeful arc, lacking truly fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates the assigned elements into a cohesive whole, but ultimately feels competent rather than exceptionally inventive or memorable, not quite reaching top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
