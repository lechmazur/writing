<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Marcus's seventeen-year torment feels more asserted than demonstrated; his pivotal shift in motivation towards embracing fate is underdeveloped and abrupt, lacking sufficient internal grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the "chance encounter at the planetarium," a convenient deus ex machina; the "cosmic loophole" for the future self is asserted without convincing integration, weakening overall coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the atmosphere is generally evocative, some descriptive phrases ("cotton candy and cyanide," "broken glass wrapped in silk") feel self-consciously ornate, bordering on purple prose and slightly distracting from the core narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story achieves its resolution through rapid reveals and declarative statements ("Of course she'd been here all along") rather than through earned emotional progression or subtly layered subtext, feeling narratively expedient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The core reveal ("they'd both been dolls all along") utilizes a familiar trope; the direct repetition of the assigned attribute "suspiciously sweet" highlights the constructed nature of the narrative rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Despite moments of lyrical beauty, the narrative structure feels overly dependent on its assigned elements, with key plot turns and resolutions appearing more as contrivances to fit requirements than as organic developments.</comment>
