<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mika's character arc, while complete, hinges on a rapid transformation and an "overzealous" trait that feels more declared than deeply integrated, slightly undermining profound psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is largely effective, but the compressed timeline for the convergence of numerous key figures (pilgrims) introduces an element of narrative convenience that slightly strains credulity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptionally potent; the "urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass" in a post-dream era creates a memorably original and atmospheric setting, a distinct triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the premise is commendably original, the reliance on the synchronized appearance of identical notebooks introduces a convenience that slightly tempers the narrative's claim to flawless ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a notable level of cohesion and imaginative power, successfully integrating its assigned elements into a resonant whole, though minor contrivances prevent perfection.</comment>
