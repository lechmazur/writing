<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Marcus's "gloomy" trait and wallet connection are well-handled, but Claire's "abrasively charming" attribute is asserted, not convincingly demonstrated, making her feel more like a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, but the pivotal reveal through Claire ("They're instructions") is too convenient and unearned, weakening the narrative thrust despite a clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create a genuinely potent, liminal atmosphere that strongly supports the core concept; however, sensory details for the "overlapping realities" could be richer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing and some imagery lands, Claire's expository dialogue for the central reveal is a significant craft issue, feeling like an authorial shortcut.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements shows a spark of originality, but the execution leans on familiar tropes (sole perceiver, enigmatic informant, "it's a map" reveal) without sufficient subversion for top-tier distinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story cohesively establishes its mystery and protagonist's role, but notable weaknesses in plot convenience and secondary character depth prevent it from reaching flawless, publishable quality.</comment>
