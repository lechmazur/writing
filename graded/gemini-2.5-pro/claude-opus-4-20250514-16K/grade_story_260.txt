<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's core motivation (gathering souls) and method (cryptic crosswords) are clear and well-integrated. However, the "obsessed" nature, while stated, could be shown with more depth or internal conflict. The assigned attribute "indefinitely absolute" feels somewhat externally applied to his commitment rather than a deeply woven character trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a cyclical sense of completeness (nightly ritual, dawn, return). The core action "proliferate" effectively drives the rising action. However, the sudden materialization and resolution for "hundreds of souls" in a short span, even with proliferation, feels a bit too condensed, and the mechanics are occasionally over-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "hush of a night with no stars" and the "abandoned library" work well to create a suitable atmosphere for the "whisper collection point." Sensory details like "jangling keys" and "scratching pen" are effective. The "whisper collection point" itself as a name is functional but not exceptionally evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story's central concept is highly unique and thought-provoking, with strong symbolic potential in crosswords as "maps home." Literary devices are generally used well. The main weakness is the slightly didactic explanation of the puzzle's power ("The answer would proliferate through dimensions...") and the overt repetition of the assigned phrases "indefinitely absolute" and "noble chaos," which marginally detract from the otherwise sophisticated craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise is strikingly original. However, the mandated repetition of the somewhat awkward phrase "indefinitely absolute" and the term "noble chaos" feels like an external constraint slightly visible in the text, hinting at an artificiality not present elsewhere. Some explanations of the supernatural mechanics are a bit too direct, lacking deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story creatively combines most assigned elements into a cohesive and imaginative narrative. The central idea is compelling and memorable. The primary detraction from a higher score is the slightly forced integration and repetition of specific assigned terminology (notably "indefinitely absolute"), which prevents the piece from feeling entirely organic and flawless.</comment>
