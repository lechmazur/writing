<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "fidgety" trait is somewhat superficial, while the "mage-smith" and "musically untalented" aspects are pivotal and strongly realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core intellectual leap (music to math) feels slightly convenient and rushed under pressure, simplifying a potentially deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric, but some sensory details lack unique vividness, and the factory setting's deeper thematic potential is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original core solution is a strength, but some descriptive language is generic fantasy fare, and direct repetition of the assigned tone feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong elemental integration and a clever core idea, but overall craft needs more polish in language, character nuance, and thematic depth for a top-tier publication.</comment>
