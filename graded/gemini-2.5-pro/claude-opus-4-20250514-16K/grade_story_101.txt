<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The landlord is an intriguing, symbolic presence, but the narrator's internal transformation ("manic clarity," "heart adapting") feels asserted rather than deeply earned or dramatized, rendering them somewhat passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While conceptually brilliant and internally coherent, the plot unfolds as a linear revelation; the central "designing" action remains abstract, lacking developed obstacles or a dynamic progression beyond the initial assignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story excels in creating a profoundly imaginative and resonant liminal world; the "before memory" timeframe and the surreal details (backwards parade, writhing blueprints) are exceptionally well-realized and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative is rich in thought-provoking symbolism and thematic depth; however, its impact is slightly blunted by occasional reliance on declarative statements for key insights rather than consistently showing the narrator's evolving understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core premise, imagery ("cryptically obvious," "memory as wet clay"), and overall execution demonstrate high originality, successfully avoiding clich√©s and establishing a distinct, memorable voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A highly creative and cohesive piece that effectively integrates its assigned elements into a memorable narrative; its primary strength lies in its unique concept and world-building, though character agency could be sharper for top-tier publication.</comment>
