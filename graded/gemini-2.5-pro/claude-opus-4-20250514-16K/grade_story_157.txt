<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Primary motivation ("ancestral purpose") is clear, but the late-introduced "watering seeds of curiosity" feels discordant and unearned within this narrative's focus; "elusive" attribute is insufficiently demonstrated through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot effectively delivers a complete arc of discovery within the word limit, driven by the unique premise, though the reliance on a single, perfectly preserved revelatory book is a somewhat conventional shortcut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse library setting is richly atmospheric and integral; the "tailgating" timeframe provides functional contrast but its pervasive influence ("throughout") feels less impactful than the immediate setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High originality of the core concept (meteorological puppetry) and vivid, often beautiful, imagery create a memorable impact; explores themes of esoteric legacy and art's connection to nature effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strikingly original premise largely avoids common tropes and formulaic writing, though some descriptive phrases ("ancestral purpose," "specifically universal") lean towards being self-consciously literary rather than wholly organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall creative and thematically cohesive, but the "watering seeds of curiosity" motivation feels like an inorganic constraint, slightly undermining the story's otherwise strong internal logic and focus on personal inheritance.</comment>
