<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's rapid, profound transformation from deep-seated shame feels unearned in the short timeframe; the "unusually usual" attribute is weakly connected to her character directly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on sudden, unexplained magical mechanics (materializing tickets, vanishing vendor) for its key turns, and the resolution is more a statement of intent than an achieved outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The strong hangar atmosphere is notable, but undermined by a slight conceptual mismatch (train punch for a spaceport) and an occasionally awkward blend of social realism with overt magical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the central metaphor of "punching prejudice" is potent, the actual mechanism of transformation is abstract and told, rather than shown with convincing emotional or visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core premise offers originality, but its execution leans on a familiar "mysterious guide with magical artifact" trope, and some descriptive phrases ("fading like morning mist") are uninspired.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic scope, but some assigned elements (notably "unusually usual") feel superficially integrated, and the narrative leans on convenient magical solutions for complex issues.</comment>
