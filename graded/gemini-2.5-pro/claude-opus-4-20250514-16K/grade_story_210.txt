<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the 'amiable' trait is underdeveloped and 'doubly singular' feels imposed; character depth beyond 'driven scholar' is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>A clear arc exists, but the presentation of multiple profound discoveries is compressed, and the initial setup with the grant feels somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is evocative, but some atmospheric descriptions rely on familiar phrasing, and the scientific leap is very rapid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept is intriguing and the crossword tie-in is clever, but the prose doesn't consistently elevate the material, and the grand scientific claims feel somewhat unearned by the brief narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the specific blend of folklore and quantum mechanics has some originality, the execution relies on some tropes, noticeable repetitive phrasing ("doubly singular," "humble rebellion"), and a premise about the timbers that stretches credulity without more finesse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious and integrates elements with some success, but falls short of 'flawless' due to repetitive phrasing, a somewhat rushed scientific leap, and prose that is competent rather than consistently exceptional.</comment>
