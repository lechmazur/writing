<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the "insomniac" trait and the psychological depth of the ghostly influence feel somewhat underdeveloped for truly exceptional characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, but the pivotal piece of evidence (the orchid cutting) feels a shade too convenient, slightly undermining flawless inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The attic setting and its connection to the botanical samples are strong; however, the "haunted" aspect could be more atmospherically potent or psychologically resonant beyond the ghost's advisory role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of botanical metaphors and strong thematic exploration of insidious, non-violent destruction; the writing craft here is a significant strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements and the specific method of revenge offer originality, though the reliance on a "ghostly advisor" and "stolen work" tropes, however well-integrated, slightly tempers its absolute uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its assigned elements into a compelling narrative, but for the highest echelon, it narrowly misses an ultimate spark of profound inevitability or deeper psychological unsettling.</comment>
