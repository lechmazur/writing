<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "aimlessly passionate" attribute feels unconvincing and poorly integrated, as the character's actions become highly focused and purposeful; the "aimless" aspect is asserted rather than organically demonstrated, creating a dissonance with her otherwise clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the arc is complete within the word limit, the paper airplane signal is a convenient narrative device, and the crucial backstory exposition about the lab's purpose is delivered somewhat bluntly rather than seamlessly woven in.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptionally evocative, with the unique setting and its sensory details being integral to the story's distinctive mood and plot, representing a clear strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a hopeful theme with effective imagery, but the concluding thematic statement ("dangerous only to those who feared a gentler world") is overly explicit, lacking the subtlety often prized in the highest echelons of literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise demonstrates originality, but the awkward and repeated use of the phrase "aimlessly passionate" slightly mars the otherwise distinctive voice and feels like an imposed, ill-fitting label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story exhibits considerable imagination and achieves a notable impact, but the imperfect integration of the key character attribute ("aimlessly passionate") and minor narrative conveniences prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
