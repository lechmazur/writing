<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The character serves the theme but lacks deep individualization or compelling demonstration of his "subtle" attribute; motivation is somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Coherent internal arc, but the plot is static, relying on a single moment of realization with minimal dynamic progression or external stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong, integral setting and thematic atmosphere, though some sensory details lean towards the abstract rather than concrete evocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Intellectually engaging with rich symbolism, but overly didactic in explaining its themes and the prose borders on being overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core schematic twist is original, but the pervasive and explicit articulation of paradoxes becomes a stylistic mannerism that feels somewhat formulaic and self-conscious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ambitious and thematically unified, but the execution relies on dense, overtly philosophical prose that can feel heavy-handed and less elegant than "flawless" work demands.</comment>
