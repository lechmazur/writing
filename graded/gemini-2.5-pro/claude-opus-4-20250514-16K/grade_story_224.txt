<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Attribute "openly private" is well-realized, and the reaction to the meteorite pivotal; however, the initial internal turmoil feels somewhat stated rather than subtly shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc with a strong catalyst; "affirmed by silence" is present but feels more like a passive enabling condition for the character's interpretation rather than a central, active plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting ("giant's dining room") and "rush hour" timeframe effectively heighten the minstrel's isolation and the atmosphere of mundane chaos he wishes to escape; sensory details are generally solid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (meteorite) and a purposeful ending create impact; minor instances of telling (e.g., explaining the witch's motivation) slightly dilute the "show, don't tell" principle at the highest level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The meteorite-in-ladle catalyst offers originality within a recognizable fantasy setting; prose is largely strong, though the "cosmic" descriptor, while thematic, is slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, with elements serving a clear thematic purpose; the concise narrative effectively delivers a sense of transformation, though it stops short of profound unexpectedness for the very top tier.</comment>
