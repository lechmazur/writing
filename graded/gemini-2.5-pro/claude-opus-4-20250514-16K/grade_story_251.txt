<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the "happily sad" attribute is stated too directly; the prophet's core ambivalence, while present, could be more deeply enacted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot forms a coherent arc driven by the 'defragment' action, but Ezra's instantaneous, full comprehension of the puzzle edges' cosmic power feels somewhat unearned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story impressively synthesizes its diverse elements into a cohesive whole, though its potential for profound thematic resonance is occasionally undercut by moments of explicit emotional exposition.</comment>
