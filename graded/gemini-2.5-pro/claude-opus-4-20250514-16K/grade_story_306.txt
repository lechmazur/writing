<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, driven by the 'authentically odd' promise; character's established quirkiness fits, but deeper psychological nuance of this defining oddness is somewhat shallow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong arc and effective pacing within the word limit; the "last secret revealed" enabling the map theft feels slightly too convenient as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent synthesis of contrasting elements (science/mysticism, ancient/modern) creating a vivid, unique, and thematically resonant atmosphere with strong sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Impactful central metaphor (universe as sheet music) and an intriguing redefinition of 'madness'; however, thematic statements like "price of ambition" are occasionally too direct, lacking desired subtlety for this tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original core premise and creative combination of elements; however, employs some recognizable tropes (e.g., mad inventor, Vatican secret) without sufficiently innovative subversion or deeper commentary on them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative integration of disparate elements into a compelling narrative; some thematic over-explanation and reliance on familiar tropes slightly diminish its claim to flawless originality.</comment>
