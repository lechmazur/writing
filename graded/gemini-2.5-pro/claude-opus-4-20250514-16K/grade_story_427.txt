<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cyrus's ultimate motivation to become a "weaver of dreams" feels like a sudden thematic endpoint rather than a consistently developed character drive; the "coded desperation" is more stated than subtly conveyed throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crucial "secret revealed under duress" (months of self-torture) is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the impact of the epiphany; the plot accelerates very rapidly through the profound central revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse and spectral phenomena effectively create a fitting atmosphere, though the "tangibly abstract" quality sometimes relies on explicit descriptions rather than pervasive sensory unsettling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has strong symbolic imagery (sock, mechanization), but key internal processes are told, and the concluding thematic statement ("to create, one must first unmake") feels somewhat overtly delivered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The central twist of a solipsistic delusion, while framed uniquely, echoes a common narrative trope, and some descriptive phrases ("fractured reality") lean on genre conventions rather than consistently fresh language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story ambitiously integrates its elements into a thought-provoking narrative, but the necessary brevity leads to a compression of psychological depth and philosophical exploration, hindering its reach for "flawless" execution.</comment>
