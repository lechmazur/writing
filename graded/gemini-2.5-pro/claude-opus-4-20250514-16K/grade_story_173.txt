<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the motivation is clear, the protagonist's "unique" quality feels asserted by the narrative (via phantom activation) rather than fully demonstrated through her inherent, developed skill or deeper internal landscape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on reclaiming routes, but this core action is resolved by a convenient external force (phantom hand), undercutting narrative tension and protagonist agency at the crucial moment of discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The primary setting is vividly rendered, but its unique strategic importance as the "perfect crossroads" is asserted rather than demonstrated through narrative events, and the "infinite possibilities" of the multiverse remain a broad backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While possessing striking imagery and a unique premise, the story's central conflict resolution via the phantom hand feels like a narrative shortcut, reducing the impact of the protagonist's own craft or insight in the moment of revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core concept offers originality, but the reliance on the phantom hand—a familiar trope for imparting information or power—tempers its overall freshness and feels less inventive than other elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves surface cohesion, but the critical plot turn facilitated by the phantom hand feels like a point of narrative convenience that detracts from a more earned, character-driven resolution expected in top-tier fiction.</comment>
