<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Valentina's complex motivations and self-realization are compellingly drawn, though the "femme fatale" aspect relies more on assertion than direct action in the scene. Marcus is functional but less developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot is slender, effectively using one key interaction for Valentina's internal arc; key actions defining her profession are established as background rather than current events.</comment>
