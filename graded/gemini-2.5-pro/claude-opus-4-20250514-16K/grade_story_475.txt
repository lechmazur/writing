<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character attributes like "detached" and "feral elegance" are more asserted than deeply woven into nuanced behavior or consistently shown through subtle action; motivation is clear but lacks unique depth for this character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and complete within the word limit, but the "accidental discovery" of the core mechanic feels somewhat convenient, and the explanation of the "glitch in reality" is too expository for top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The world is highly atmospheric, with strong synergy between setting and timeframe; however, the explicit statement "its abandoned magnificence a perfect metaphor" is a significant instance of telling, not showing, which detracts from otherwise effective immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story presents strong conceptual imagery and symbolism, but its impact is lessened by crucial instances of "telling" (e.g., explaining the metaphor, the reality glitch) and prose that occasionally strains for literary effect, bordering on purple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The central method (coded lullabies) is highly original; however, the narrative relies on some repeated distinctive phrases ("feral elegance," "hauntingly bright") and the "accidental discovery" trope, which slightly dulls its overall freshness and polish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is creative and thematically cohesive, successfully integrating its elements; however, its stylistic ambition sometimes results in self-consciously ornate prose and moments of "telling" that prevent it from achieving the flawless, subtle execution demanded at the highest level.</comment>
