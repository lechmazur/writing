<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "hyperactive" aspect of the defining attribute ("hyperactively serene") is insufficiently demonstrated in Eliza's observable actions, relying more on statement than consistent showing, which makes her outward composure read more as just "serene" or "controlled."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While coherent with a clear arc, the assigned "action" (throb) is a passive character reaction rather than a significant driver of the main plot, which is propelled by Eliza's deliberate confrontations and revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The steampunk setting provides a unique atmosphere and facilitates one plot point (acoustics), but feels somewhat like an elaborate backdrop rather than being intrinsically woven into the core human conflict or essential beyond its aesthetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves its thematic point about hollow victory with some strong imagery ("velvet blade," "battle flag"), but the overall impact is slightly blunted by familiar emotional territory for revenge narratives and minor character portrayal inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central revenge method (mixtapes in a steampunk setting) offers originality, but some prose ("recognition dawned," "reputation crumbled") and the ultimate emotional resolution tread familiar paths, lacking consistent, striking freshness throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative is largely cohesive and creatively combines many elements, but subtle weaknesses in the full demonstration of the character attribute and the centrality of the assigned "action" prevent it from reaching truly flawless execution.</comment>
