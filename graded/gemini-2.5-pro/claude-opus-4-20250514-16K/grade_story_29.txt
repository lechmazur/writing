<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "clever" aspect of the "cleverly naive" attribute is insufficiently demonstrated, leaning on assertion rather than specific, ingenious action by Elara beyond finding the frequency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The Machine's capitulation feels too swift and easy after the frequency is applied, slightly undermining its established menace and the protagonist's seven-year struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the atmosphere is evocative with strong imagery, the core setting elements (mystic garden, maze, regret-machine) are well-executed versions of somewhat conventional fantasy tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong thematic impact and uses memorable imagery, but the prose occasionally strains for poetic effect, risking a self-consciously lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core originality lies in the Machine's resolution—healing through wholeness via a "healing song" and a "jigsaw edge of reality"—which is a genuinely inventive and thoughtful subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A thematically rich narrative with an original resolution; however, deeper character nuance and a more rigorously developed central confrontation would elevate it further.</comment>
