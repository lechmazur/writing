<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "locksmith" persona feels somewhat superficially connected to the core dance narrative once her tools become useless; stated motivation is clear, but the initial "cost everything" lacks deep emotional development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A clear arc is present, but the initial discovery method (yearbooks) feels somewhat detached from the story's magical climax; the rapid learning of numerous complex dances feels narratively compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative world-building with strong sensory details ("salt spray kissed apple blossoms") effectively establishes the unique "physically metaphysical" setting and the specified "jaded wonder" atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful thematic resonance regarding cultural preservation and impactful use of central metaphors (trees as libraries, body as key) elevate the narrative; the ending is poignant and purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise is highly original, blending practical skills with profound mysticism; the lyrical prose and fresh metaphors ("time was a lock she couldn't pick") demonstrate a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A thematically rich and imaginative story that is largely cohesive; its brevity feels impactful, leaving a lingering sense of beauty and loss, though the locksmith-to-dancer transition could be deeper.</comment>
