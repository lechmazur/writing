<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc and initial 'desperately casual' attribute effective; however, the profound, centuries-long shift feels somewhat rapid despite the fantastical catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly coherent and complete arc within the word limit; the metaphorical plot mechanics of 'heartbreak dissolving probability' are slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere strongly supports the theme; dimensional descriptions, while vivid, occasionally use familiar 'weird dimension' tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and symbolism; however, some key metaphors are common, and the main theme is stated somewhat overtly at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic pitfalls and feels human-written; the core 'logic-to-emotion' character arc is a familiar pattern, albeit well-executed here.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, with elements serving the story well within its purposeful brevity; a very strong piece, yet lacks a truly groundbreaking innovation for the highest echelon.</comment>
