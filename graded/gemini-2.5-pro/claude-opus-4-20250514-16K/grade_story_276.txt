<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Emissary's 'unease' is superficial and her deeper motivations remain opaque; human characters are primarily reactive, lacking significant development or distinct voice beyond their immediate reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and the pacing adequate, but the final grand revelation through Chen's vision feels somewhat abrupt and overly convenient as an info-dump, despite its poetic nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the mundane picnic setting with cosmic events is initially effective, but the wider orbital station environment lacks specific, immersive sensory detail, feeling more like a generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The central symbolism of the coathanger and the theme of interconnectedness are intellectually stimulating, but the story relies heavily on the emissary's pronouncements to convey its message, with limited emotional resonance earned through human character experience or struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core conceit (coathanger revealing cosmic patterns) offers strong originality, but the narrative employs some familiar sci-fi tropes (e.g., the 'wise, gentle alien,' 'ancient eyes') without substantial subversion, slightly dulling its innovative edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story presents a poetically intriguing concept and maintains cohesion, but its ultimate impact is constrained by underdeveloped characters and a passive reception of wisdom by humans, making it feel more like an allegorical illustration than a deeply resonant narrative.</comment>
