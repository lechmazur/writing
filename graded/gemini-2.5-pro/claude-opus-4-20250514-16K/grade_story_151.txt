<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's "awe" is a wellspring for discovery, but the "obsessive calculations" preserving her full emotional range feel more like a convenient premise than a deeply explored character facet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the plot forms a complete arc, the critical leap from theoretical snowflake patterns to flawless self-application is abrupt and lacks the struggle or nuanced process expected in a high-stakes discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The icy, crystalline world is superbly rendered, creating a powerful atmosphere; however, the serendipity of finding the grandmother's specific, historically charged veil in the orchard strains believability, even symbolically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story's exploration of the moral dilemma is its strongest asset, yet some key symbols like the "Idol of Silence" and certain emotional descriptors ("beautiful terror") lack the subtlety demanded by top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The snowflake-to-emotion mechanism offers a spark of true originality, but the narrative framework of a post-emotional society and a singular savior figure treads somewhat familiar speculative ground, requiring more subversion to feel entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story skillfully integrates its many components into a thematically resonant whole, yet the sheer density of its potent symbolism occasionally feels overly explicit or self-aware for its concise form, marginally diminishing its organic impact.</comment>
