<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "wilderness wisdom" attribute feels superficially connected to the character's technical insight and problem-solving, appearing more as an asserted philosophical stance than an earned skill for this specific context; Marcus leans towards an archetype built for the plot's needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A significant logical gap exists in how braille-conveyed "frequency" pinpoints a physical panel; the swift, off-screen construction and activation of a dimension-shifting engine from "scattered parts" by dawn is implausibly rapid, undermining the narrative's credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "abandoned repair bay" offers functional atmosphere but relies on conventional tropes of decay; the "wilderness wisdom" concept feels thematically and atmospherically incongruous with the immediate techno-magical setting of the bay itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on explicitly stating its theme ("endings were merely stubborn illusions") and Marcus's brilliance ("immediately grasped") rather than achieving these through more subtle, emergent storytelling; some phrasing ("finality's tyranny") is melodramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the engine concept is original, the narrative employs the "lone genius discovers lost tech" trope and several stock phrases ("peculiar urgency," "practiced precision"), diluting its freshness and lending a somewhat formulaic feel to the execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The core engine concept shows promise, but its impact is lessened by the forced integration of certain elements (notably "wilderness wisdom" in a practical sense) and plot progression that leans on convenience and a rushed climax, preventing it from achieving true cohesiveness.</comment>
