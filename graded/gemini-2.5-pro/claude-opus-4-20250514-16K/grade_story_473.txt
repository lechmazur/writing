<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot is well-defined as "calculatedly unpredictable," but the "eccentric" aspect feels more like an initial descriptor than a deeply explored facet; her pragmatism and strategic depth overshadow overt eccentricity shown in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong arc and pacing within the word limit, but the initial significance of the "Handshakes" manual, with its detailed encoded knowledge, feels somewhat diluted as Margot's personal, more rebellious maps take narrative precedence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central visual conflict (orchard vs. panels) is potent and the atmosphere well-established, though some descriptive passages could employ more consistently striking and unique sensory details to achieve flawless immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful use of subtext and symbolism, particularly the recurring motif of pruning and the provocative maps, creating a resonant theme of defiant legacy and the weight of leadership.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and avoids formulaic tendencies, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fruit heavy with rebellion") and a nuanced portrayal of Margotâ€™s complex motivations, lending strong originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story masterfully weaves its assigned elements into a thematically rich and concise narrative, leaving a lasting impression of resilience against a vividly imagined oppressive backdrop; most elements feel integral.</comment>
