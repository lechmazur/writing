<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vera's key attribute "philosophically practical" is stated rather than purely shown initially; her telekinesis feels more like flavor than a crucial element in resolving the core intellectual puzzle. Korvash is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot relies on a major coincidence (Vera's specific rare knowledge matching the specific rare artifact). Korvash's swift agreement to a life-altering project feels somewhat unearned for his established character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting is functional but lacks deep sensory immersion; "sacred disorder" is an intriguing thematic touch but the atmosphere could be more richly textured beyond key phrases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and symbolism, but some descriptive phrases ("impossible angles," repeated "sacred disorder") border on being overly stylized, and the ending, while poignant, tiptoes near sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central conceit is inventive, but the narrative employs the "last speaker" trope, and the reuse of key descriptive phrases slightly diminishes freshness. Character reasoning, while logical, could offer more nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Impressive thematic integration and originality for its brevity, but minor contrivances in plot and character motivation, alongside some slightly self-conscious prose, prevent it from reaching "flawless" status.</comment>
