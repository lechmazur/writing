<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "earthy farmer" trait feels superficial, and the "effectively unique" attribute is awkwardly handled by direct statement rather than organic demonstration of such uniqueness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot is clear and has a discernible arc, but the primary driving action is the preparation of the recipe, not "celebrate," which is a secondary emotional response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is achieved, but the core setting choice (northern lights viewing platform) is jarringly incongruous with the "earthy farmer" character and her task, feeling highly artificial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphor and emotional resonance, but marred by moments of slightly overwrought prose and the awkward incorporation of the given phrase "effectively unique."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original central idea (recipe as map to freedom), but the chosen setting feels somewhat clich√©d for dramatic effect, and the attribute "effectively unique" is inelegantly integrated by direct quotation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the core theme is strong, the incongruous setting and awkward handling of a key given attribute prevent the story from feeling truly cohesive or publishable at the highest tier.</comment>
