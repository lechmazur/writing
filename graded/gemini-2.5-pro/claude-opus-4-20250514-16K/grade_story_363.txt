<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Samuel's "passionately indifferent" delivery and grief-lightness are well-articulated, but the Brotherhood's collective "passionately indifferent" nature is asserted more than demonstrated through varied individual responses; his voice is distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Core plot is coherent, but the initial parade element feels superficially attached, and the rapid escalation of visions to "distant moons" feels somewhat narratively unearned from the personal grief-source.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is generally good, particularly the poignant aspects and the gas lamp/bulb detail, but the "secret society meeting hall" itself lacks uniquely evocative or distinctly "secret" qualities beyond its function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High impact with strong thematic resonance and excellent metaphors (e.g., "grief and progress often wear the same face"), but a key character dynamic ("caring deeply while appearing merely to observe") is explicitly told rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Brotherhood's concept offers originality, and metaphors are fresh. However, the sudden scale-up of nightmare content from local automation to interstellar colonies feels less organically rooted in the character's specific grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A commendable piece skillfully weaving its elements into a poignant narrative with a powerful central symbol (the bell), but minor disjunctions and moments of telling prevent it from achieving "flawless" status for the highest echelon.</comment>
