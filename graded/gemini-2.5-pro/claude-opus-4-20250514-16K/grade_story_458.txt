<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, but her defining attribute "spiritually secular" feels more descriptive of the era than a deeply explored facet of her character, leaving her internal landscape somewhat underdeveloped beyond her immediate mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a commendable arc within the word limit, but the pivotal galactic choice hinging on a "simple yes or no" lacks mechanical grounding, rendering the climax overly abstract and straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "fractal sorrow" tone and desolate "abandoned spaceport" effectively build atmosphere; however, the titular "flying library" itself remains a vivid concept rather than a fully realized, sensory-rich setting element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the story employs striking imagery ("dark blooms," "stories like bridges") and a unique central conceit, the ultimate thematic impact regarding shared stories, while worthy, doesn't quite transcend its familiar core to offer truly profound, new insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The coffee-stain divination provides a spark of originality, yet phrases like "fractal sorrow," while evocative, border on being self-consciously literary, and the "last guardian" trope, though refreshed, still underpins the narrative structure somewhat predictably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The elements cohere impressively, but the narrative feels more like a tantalizing, concept-dense prologue than a wholly self-contained piece. Its ambition within the word count sometimes results in telling over subtle showing of its grandest ideas.</comment>
