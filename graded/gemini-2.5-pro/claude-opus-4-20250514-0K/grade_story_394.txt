<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's core "archer" identity is superficial until the climax; "aimlessly passionate" backstory is stated rather than compellingly shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on convenient late reveals (grandmother) and unexamined plot devices ("technology that shouldn't exist"), weakening coherence for a top-tier piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Several elements feel under-integrated or too conveniently deployed to serve the plot, revealing structural seams rather than flawless execution.</comment>
