<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "grim sentinel" remains largely an archetype serving the atmosphere, with his motivation for escape revealed somewhat abruptly rather than emerging from deep, established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While coherent, the plot hinges on the somewhat convenient discovery of the note and employs the familiar "simulated reality" trope, limiting narrative surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Significant strength: the "ghost town at dawn" setting and "between shows" timeframe are masterfully woven to create a potent, immersive, and thematically resonant atmosphere.</comment>
