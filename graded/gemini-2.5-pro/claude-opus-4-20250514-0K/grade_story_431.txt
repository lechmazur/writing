<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dancer attribute is creatively integrated into her problem-solving method, but the "affectionate" aspect of her stated detachment is more asserted than deeply evinced, and the final stage of her transformation feels somewhat condensed for its significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot coheres with knitting as a novel deciphering action, yet the "illogically logical" nature of the code and the conveniently glowing charts lean heavily on thematic resonance, sidestepping more rigorous mechanistic clarity for the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The office atmosphere is effectively built with precise sensory details like the "smell of old paper and resignation," creating a potent internal space, though the external "desolate wasteland" remains a more generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through its central metaphors (constellations as choreography, wasteland as crucible) and subtextual exploration of perceptual escape, though some internal states are conveyed via direct exposition rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core premise (dancer knitting astronomical codes for escape) is strikingly original and well-executed, though a few supporting descriptive phrases ("dusty desk," "whispered of escape") tread more conventional literary ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A high degree of creative synthesis allows the disparate assigned elements to form a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative, though its resolution's reliance on a mystical understanding of the code might not meet all critical demands for intricate internal logic.</comment>
