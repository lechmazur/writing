<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "eager" attribute feels somewhat misaligned with Marcus's depicted quiet competence and grim determination; his core motivation is clear, but its deep origins are not fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the "wager of faith" feels lightly tested, and the entity's transformation to "Friend" is rather swift for a top-tier literary piece.</comment>
