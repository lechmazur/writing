<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kira's pivotal "peculiar faith" is asserted rather than deeply demonstrated initially, making her profound motivational shift feel somewhat abrupt. Tomek's "fierce loyalty" after three days is a narrative shortcut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central mechanism—deciphering linguistic data from poster bruises—is highly imaginative but strains credulity significantly for top-tier literary fiction, feeling overly serendipitous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "frozen harbor" and "mechanical caravans" create a genuinely striking, atmospheric setting, a clear strength. However, deeper, consistent sensory engagement could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of cultural preservation is potent, but the resolution relies on telling ("more importantly") rather than consistently showing the character's internal thematic shift, weakening its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Novel core premise (bruise-map linguistics) is a strength, yet the narrative structure employs somewhat un-subverted archetypes (wise elder, instant loyal guide) and lacks a consistently distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesive blend of intriguing concepts, but the improbable central discovery and accelerated character allegiances prevent it from achieving the "flawless" standard, feeling more like a promising sketch.</comment>
