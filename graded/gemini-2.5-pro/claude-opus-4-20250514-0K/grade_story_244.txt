<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kira's guilt is a strong driver, but the 'reservedly' aspect of her boldness is underdeveloped, and the shopkeeper's convenient knowledge slightly undermines her final discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Achieves a clear arc and thematic resolution within the word limit, but relies on convenient exposition (historians, shopkeeper) rather than fully earned discovery at points, and the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The neon shop setting is strikingly atmospheric and integral to the plot's mechanics; however, the 'rose petal' timeframe feels like an arbitrary, poorly integrated marker.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The master's orchestrated death provides a strong, memorable twist and there's good subtext, but the transformative destination is described too vaguely, lessening the resolution's full impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original blend of gritty urban setting with mysticism and a clever twist on the mentor trope, though somewhat undercut by trope-ish supporting characters (sage shopkeeper) and convenient plot devices (historians).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully merges disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant narrative, though some plot mechanics (rose petal, method of gleaning secrets) feel slightly forced rather than organic, preventing flawless execution.</comment>
