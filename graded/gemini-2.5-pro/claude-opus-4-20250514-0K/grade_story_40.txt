<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's core guilt is well-established and symbolized, but the "fierce" aspect of her "tentatively fierce" nature feels more asserted than demonstrated through impactful action; her agency in the final resolution is somewhat passive, relying on the discovered recipe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While achieving a complete arc, the plot hinges on an exceedingly convenient coincidence regarding Dr. Chen's patient, which feels overly engineered to resolve Maya's specific centuries-old guilt and the descendant's inherited trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "Recipe Repository" setting is wonderfully inventive and thematically rich, offering strong atmosphere, though the wider fantastical elements like reincarnation feel more like background dressing than a deeply integrated system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story features inventive metaphors (e.g., "memories are turning into fish") and a unique concept, but the resolution via the "recipe's" aphoristic advice feels somewhat superficial compared to the established depth of Maya's centuries-long guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a reincarnated goldfish caretaker and the "Recipe Repository" demonstrates significant originality; however, the actual "recipe" for alleviation, while fitting the tone, leans towards a familiar self-help maxim rather than a more nuanced narrative discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story's charm and originality are undeniable, particularly in its central concepts, but the extreme neatness of the plot resolution and the somewhat glib nature of the discovered "cure" slightly diminish its overall literary depth for a top-tier publication.</comment>
