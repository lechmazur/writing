<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The agoraphobia's profound depth is undermined by its overly swift, magically convenient resolution, weakening character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on a somewhat arbitrary magical timing ("the switch will know") and a poetically vague causal method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere and setting details are strong, though the phrase "realistically fanciful clarity" feels self-conscious and slightly jarring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original core concept is commendable, but relies on some familiar tropes (heirloom switch) and the magical resolution feels somewhat formulaic in its swiftness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Creative elements and strong atmosphere are present, but narrative shortcuts and a too-neat magical fix prevent it from reaching "flawless" execution.</comment>
