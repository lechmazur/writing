<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong core motivation, but the "trustworthy strange" attribute, particularly the "strange" aspect, feels under-explored, limiting full character depth beyond her immediate mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent vignette structure effectively driven by the core action; however, it lacks groundbreaking plot complexity or unexpected turns for the absolute highest tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and creative integration of disparate elements into a poignant narrative; a compelling piece that is very close to top-tier publishability but requires minor refinements for "flawless" status.</comment>
