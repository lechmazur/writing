<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's "lovingly detached" attribute and motivation are clear and well-integrated into his actions and sparse dialogue, but the lead weaver's rapid shift from dismissive to appreciative feels somewhat underdeveloped for her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot presents a clear arc from intent to resolution, effectively driven by the "meddle" action; however, the weavers' ultimate collaboration, while poignant, softens the "impossible" nature of the vow a bit too conveniently.</comment>
