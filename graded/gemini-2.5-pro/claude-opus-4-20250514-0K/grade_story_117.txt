<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character feels more like a functional observer than a deeply realized individual; motivation is largely thematic and retroactively understood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and serves the theme but follows a somewhat predictable arc; resolution of 'mosaic realities' is neat but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is competently established but relies on familiar tropes; 'earnest absurdity' is present but not consistently striking in its execution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Core concepts (lens, mosaic realities, creative haunting) offer good originality, but prose and emotional expression occasionally lean on convention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>A thematically resonant and cohesive story with creative elements, but lacks the exceptional depth or stylistic innovation for top-tier publication.</comment>
