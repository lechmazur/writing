<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Core motivation is compelling and drives the narrative, but the assigned 'artfully messy' attribute feels superficial and unintegrated; voice is functional but lacks distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear arc and emotional payoff within the tight constraint; however, the radio wave garden's perfect signal clarity for the crucial call feels like a minor narrative convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay and long-held secrets is effective, and sensory details are present; the 'radio wave garden' setting, while functionally integrated, feels somewhat tonally disparate from the core historical grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story achieves significant emotional impact, particularly through the subtext of the wife's prior knowledge; however, the concluding phrase "reveal their dead" verges on being overly dramatic for the highest literary standard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative avoids an artificial feel and demonstrates human emotional nuance; however, it relies on somewhat familiar tropes (deathbed confession, all-knowing spouse) without offering a truly radical subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Most elements are cohesively woven to create an emotional narrative; the 'artfully messy' attribute stands out as poorly integrated and perfunctory, slightly marring an otherwise proficient piece.</comment>
