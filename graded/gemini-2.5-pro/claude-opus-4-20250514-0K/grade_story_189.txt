<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and her "uniquely literal" attribute serves the plot well, but character depth and distinct voice are somewhat constrained by a generic descriptor ("bright eyes," used twice) and a portrayal that, while capable, leans more functional than deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is exceptionally tight and coherent for its length, with the core action ("overcharge") and method ("parsing notes") effectively driving a complete and satisfying narrative arc from setup to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (phosphorescent moss, dripping water, humming terminal) and the seamless integration of the "haunted lighthouse basement" setting with the post-war timeframe create a powerfully immersive and thematically resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves significant thematic resonance and emotional impact, primarily through its unique central premise (stellar data in phone infrastructure) and skillful use of imagery, culminating in a genuinely hopeful and satisfying ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core conceit of stellar data encoded in obsolete telecommunications infrastructure by a defunct phone company is brilliantly original, and the narrative largely avoids common tropes, presenting a fresh voice despite minor commonphrases ("fingers danced").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Demonstrates exceptional cohesion and creative synthesis of its varied elements, resulting in a memorable and thought-provoking piece where the fantastical premise feels grounded and the brief length is used to maximum, impactful effect.</comment>
