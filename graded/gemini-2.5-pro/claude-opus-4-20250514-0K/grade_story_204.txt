<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's "deep-seated prejudice" dissolves with unconvincing rapidity; its prior impact is merely asserted, not demonstrated, weakening her arc's foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core narrative arc is coherent, but the "acceptance speech" simile functions as a strained, isolated metaphor rather than a well-integrated plot anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The hangar setting is a significant strength, creating potent atmosphere; however, the assigned "timeframe" is a superficial metaphorical flourish with no sustained narrative relevance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story offers genuine emotional resonance and thematic exploration, but its impact is slightly dulled by a common simile ("sugar in rain") and an overly swift resolution to Maya's central internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise exhibits marked originality and the writing largely avoids clich√©, presenting a fresh perspective; however, emotional beats can feel somewhat accelerated rather than fully developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While creatively conceived, the story's bid for profundity is hampered by the imperfect integration of some assigned elements and a key character transformation that feels more expedient than earned.</comment>
