<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot offers a clear mini-arc of discovery, but the "oddly predictable" nature of challenges results in very low stakes, prioritizing charm over significant narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The world-building is a significant strength, creating a vivid, phantasmagorical atmosphere; minor background elements, however, occasionally feel more decorative than integral to the core narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exhibits remarkable originality through its unique synthesis of a whimsical protagonist, her peculiar power, and the delightfully absurd "sacred practices," creating a genuinely fresh narrative space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Achieves impressive cohesion by artfully integrating its fantastical elements; its deliberate lightness, however, prioritizes charm over the complex conflict or deep character arcs often demanded at the highest literary tier.</comment>
