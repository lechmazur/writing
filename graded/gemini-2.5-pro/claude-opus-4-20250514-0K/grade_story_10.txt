<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's transformation is compelling, and her "duelist's precision" is well-applied to the new context; however, her initial motivation for seeking the powerful recipes feels somewhat underdeveloped before the more profound quest for forgiveness takes center stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot masterfully executes a significant character arc driven by the unique "elasticizing" recipes within a concise framework, though the initial grand scale of her search ("three systems") feels somewhat disproportionate to the intensely personal, single-room resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of transformative culinary magic offers profound thematic depth and emotional impact, with the "recipes" serving as powerful literary devices, even if the compression of seventeen such experiences is necessarily brief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a high degree of originality by subverting the familiar redemption arc with its inventive "molecular gastronomy" method, largely avoiding formulaic writing and presenting a fresh narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates exceptional creative ingenuity in unifying its diverse assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically rich story that leaves a lingering emotional resonance, with the central conceit being particularly memorable.</comment>
