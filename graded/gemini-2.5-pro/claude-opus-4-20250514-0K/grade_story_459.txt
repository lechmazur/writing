<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation evolves convincingly, and the profession informs her analytical method. However, the "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels somewhat superficial, introduced but not deeply influential beyond minor physical descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and satisfying arc within the word limit, with logical cause and effect. The "staking out ghost tours" method feels more like expositional backstory than an actively integrated element driving the present narrative, slightly weakening its structural necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "Sand Castle Preservation Lab" setting is exceptionally well-utilized, creating a powerful symbolic atmosphere that is deeply integral to the story's themes and Maya's realization. The connection between object, setting, and concept is superb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of symbolism and metaphor, crafting a narrative with significant subtext and a poignant thematic resolution ("preservation is just another word for haunting"). The writing style is evocative and impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core premise and its development are original, particularly the nature of the ghosts and Maya's role. While generally fresh, a few phrases like "burden of sight" verge on the familiar, and the "elegantly clumsy/beautifully awkward" pairing feels slightly self-conscious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates impressive creative thinking in combining disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant narrative. The brief length feels purposeful, delivering a complete emotional and thematic arc, though one assigned element (ghost tours) feels less seamlessly integrated than others.</comment>
