<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but Elena remains more a symbolic figure than a deeply nuanced character; the "moral weight" of her discovery is asserted rather than earned through demonstrated internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and the arc is complete for a short piece, but the stated "moral dilemma" is superficial, and the idol's defeat feels too swift and simplistic given its described magnitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>World-building and atmosphere are vividly realized and thematically resonant through strong sensory details; the "crystal shadows" tone is effectively maintained, creating a strong sense of place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Poetic language and an original core idea are present, but the narrative impact is weakened by significant "telling" of crucial backstory and emotional states, and the key phrase "rationally organic cultivation" is somewhat clunky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central snowflake-emotion conceit is fresh and inventive. However, the attribute "rationally organic" feels artificially imposed, and some framing elements (last emotional human, idol of fear) lean on familiar tropes without substantial subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story presents an ambitious concept with evocative imagery, but for the highest tier, its thematic depth is often stated rather than shown, and key plot developments lack the gravitas or nuance expected.</comment>
