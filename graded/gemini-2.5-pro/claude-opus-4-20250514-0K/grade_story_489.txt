<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "aggressively kind" attribute is unconvincingly portrayed and feels disconnected from her otherwise "brazen calm"; the keeper's daughter, however, has a well-realized arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc and strong coherence within the word limit, effectively driven by the ritualistic action and the central magical method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid atmosphere; sensory details effectively immerse the reader and the setting perfectly supports the story's ancient, mystical concept and the characters' motivations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong literary craft, effectively using symbolism (whistle, lighthouse beam) and resonant imagery to convey its theme of tradition and remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While largely original in its synthesis of elements, the phrasing of the "aggressively kind" attribute feels somewhat artificial, and the ghost's resolution, while fitting, leans on a familiar trope structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story masterfully integrates its assigned elements into a cohesive and thematically rich narrative that transcends its brevity, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
