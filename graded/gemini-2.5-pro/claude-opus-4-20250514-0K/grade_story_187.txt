<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Wanderer's stoicism is effective; Corvina's 'brash tenderness' well-portrayed. Wanderer's "shockingly tender" moment feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned by extreme prior detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc and good pacing within word limit; the assigned "impose" action is functional for entry but not the central plot driver, which is the preservation itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric immersion and thematic resonance achieved through vivid sensory details and an integral, well-realized setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High impact with strong thematic delivery, purposeful dialogue, and memorable lines; effectively "shows" and evokes contemplation on truth and memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original core premise (death-scream archive) and unique "mesmerizingly bland" attribute refresh familiar tropes; avoids overt formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements integrated effectively into a cohesive, resonant vignette with a strong, lingering central idea; brevity feels deliberate and impactful.</comment>
