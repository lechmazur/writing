<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation shift is compelling, but the decades-long unawareness of the memory cost, despite a prior hint, strains credulity slightly; the core sacrifice mechanism is strong but its initial forgetting is convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc and coherence within the word limit, driven effectively by the flashbacks; however, the final resolution of binding stories "with the very air" is poetically ambitious but mechanically vague, lacking concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting and the "tapestry of lost legends" timeframe are atmospherically resonant and well-integrated; sensory details are good, though the broader "tapestry" relies more on assertion than extensive depiction within this brief scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic depth and employs symbolism effectively (wrapper, butterflies); the "casual cruelty" insight is a significant strength, though the rapid succession of profound epiphanies challenges psychological realism slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central conceit of telekinesis as memory-weaving is notably original, subverting a common power; however, the narrative structure leans on the "forgotten crucial past" trope, and some phrasing occasionally borders on the overly lyrical rather than consistently sharp prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its assigned elements into a thoughtful narrative with a strong thematic core; the ultimate realization and new purpose are impactful, though the speed of achieving complete understanding and mastery at the very end feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>
