<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Korvain's 'skeptically credulous' attribute and internal conflict are well-realized; the 'minstrel' aspect feels secondary to his active role in this specific plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc and effective internal climax for its length; the core 'disown' action is a past revelation rather than a direct driver of present plot momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly oppressive and thematically resonant; the 'timeframe' element (a past vow) functions as discovered content, not the story's primary temporal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional thematic depth through symbolism (bird, garden) and subtext (myth-making); the 'angry peace' emotional state is strikingly original and well-portrayed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Successfully subverts common dystopian tropes through nuanced character motivations (Elena's principle) and fresh emotional textures, avoiding predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully integrated, creating a thematically rich and cohesive narrative that uses its brevity to powerful effect, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
