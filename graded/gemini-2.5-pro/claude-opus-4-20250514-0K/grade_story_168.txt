<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "ruthless" attribute feels more like past reputation than an active trait in the core scene; "intellectually spontaneous" is better realised.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and complete, but the specified "method" (road trip conversations) is an indirect facilitator for the "action" (distinguishing symbols).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting and specific timeframe are highly effective, but the "polite anarchy" tone is a better fit for Margot's art than the overall narrative mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ideas and distinct style, though some narrative components (e.g., mysterious guide archetype) are familiar territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thought-provoking, with creative integration of elements making the short form feel impactful and deliberate.</comment>
