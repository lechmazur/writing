<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's "earnestly frivolous" attribute is compellingly realized through his unique confetti-based interactions, making his peculiar wisdom memorable; however, his internal emotional journey feels somewhat understated compared to his intellectual transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot's coherence suffers slightly from an inconsistent mechanism for the confetti messages, with the final one forming magically in the air, a departure from the earlier "deciphered" ones, and the resolution of his departure feels abrupt.</comment>
