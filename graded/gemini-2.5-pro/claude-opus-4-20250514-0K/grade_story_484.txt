<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The 'uniquely generic' attribute is a strong foundation, but the character's pivotal emotional shift feels abrupt and the declared 'flippant solemnity' isn't consistently embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear, but the overly didactic 'Here Lies Originality' tombstone and the convenient discovery of the cellar significantly undermine literary subtlety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The graveyard setting effectively creates a fitting atmosphere, but the 'haunted' aspect is underutilized, and sensory details, while present, lack exceptional richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While there's thematic potential regarding authenticity, the impact is severely dulled by on-the-nose symbolism (tombstone, motto) and a somewhat facile resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core 'uniquely generic' concept is promising, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes (descent into past for redemption) and the meta-commentary is too explicit, lacking true subversive originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements around a good central idea, but significant flaws like didacticism and a predictable character arc prevent it from reaching top-tier publishability.</comment>
