<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's "fierce" conviction and motivation are clear and compelling, strongly linked to the symbolic ghost costume; however, the "ambassador" aspect feels somewhat nominal and the "playful" quality is more asserted than deeply integrated into her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot effectively uses the core action and method to build a coherent, albeit fantastical, narrative arc within the word limit; however, the confirmation of humanity-wide success via a single future letter feels somewhat expedient for the ambitious premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "sunken zeppelin" setting is exceptionally original and atmospheric, with vivid sensory details that powerfully enhance the story's themes and Vera's mission; the "between radio static" timeframe adds a fittingly ethereal quality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a significant thought-provoking impact through its unique perspective, potent symbolism (drowning, letters, costume), and exploration of illusion versus reality; the writing craft is strong and evocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative demonstrates high originality in its premise and the combination of its core elements, largely avoiding clich√©s and creating a distinct voice; the metaphors are generally fresh, though a couple of key descriptive phrases for the protagonist are repeated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive cohesion, weaving its disparate elements into a compelling whole that feels deliberate in its brevity and leaves a strong, lingering philosophical resonance; its creative ambition is a clear strength.</comment>
