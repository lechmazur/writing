<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: Knight's emotional arc and daughter's "grudgingly sweet" forgiveness are well-defined. Weakness: The knight remains somewhat archetypal, and character depth is constrained by brevity, limiting truly profound originality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: Clear, emotionally resonant plot structure driven by the discovery of the patterned items. Weakness: The second "impossible choice" (shattering the mirror) lacks the gravitas and consequence of the first, feeling more rhetorical than truly impossible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: The "lighthouse prison" setting and the "mirrored reflection" timeframe synergize effectively to create a potent, melancholic atmosphere. Weakness: The "jagged reef" detail is perfunctory and adds little significant texture or thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves significant emotional impact through powerful symbolism (items, mirror) and a well-earned resolution. Weakness: Explicitly stating "impossible choice" (twice) and "joyful agony" somewhat diminishes the subtlety expected, bordering on telling rather than purely showing these complex states.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: The core mechanism of the daughter's message (patterned items, magic mirror) offers a degree of originality. Weakness: Reliance on archetypal figures (weatherbeaten knight, imprisoned daughter) and some familiar phrasing ("terrible beauty," repeated "impossible choice") tempers overall inventiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: The story achieves a notable emotional cohesion and delivers a poignant thematic message within its concise form. Weakness: While most elements are well-integrated, the brass door knocker, though providing framing, feels somewhat ornamental to the central emotional conflict and resolution.</comment>
