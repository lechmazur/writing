<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation from "old promises" is clear, but the "blunt heretic" trait lacks full behavioral demonstration, and "enthusiastically cautious" feels slightly discordant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc and pacing; however, a minor conceptual ambiguity exists between the initial "artificial oracle" and the revealed "scrolls" as its true form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong. The setting is richly atmospheric and intrinsically linked to the character's actions and the story's thematic core.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Largely original. The central premise subverts a common trope innovatively, though the specific phrase "enthusiastically cautious" feels somewhat artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Highly effective. Successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative that resonates beyond its brief length.</comment>
