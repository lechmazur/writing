<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'unsteady' aspect is well-integrated and resolved, but the 'coyly furious' attribute is poorly realized; 'furious disappointment' is present, but 'coyly' is absent, weakening the specific character brief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear and coherent arc from doubt to revelation within the tight word limit, effectively driven by the 'reassembling letters' method, though the bird's instantaneous shift in allegiance post-revelation feels overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create a potent atmosphere of decay and impending cosmic significance; 'cheerless ecstasy' is boldly stated and partially evoked, though its full, pervasive nuance is ambitious for the length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism and achieves a purposeful thematic resolution concerning truth and destiny; however, some emotional beats like 'cheerless ecstasy incarnate' are stated more than subtly woven into the broader narrative texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the twist on the prophecy offers some freshness, the narrative relies on familiar sci-fi tropes (Oracle Council, sentient AI companion) and some well-worn phrases ("terrible beauty") without significant subversion or uniquely striking imagery throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and uses its elements to build an evocative, thought-provoking snapshot, but for the highest echelon, it lacks the consistent sharpness and deep originality in every component that would mark it as flawless.</comment>
