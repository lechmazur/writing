<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but her transformation is more asserted than dramatized. The concluding realization, "it was not just a civilization that she reimagined, but herself," is stated twice, functioning as a summary rather than an earned, embodied shift. Her internal conflict between revolutionary and archaeologist is a static premise, not an active, contradictory force within the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and reflection rather than causal events. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (an internal shift to a new stasis) with a legible on-page cost—the "burnished sorrow still present, but now tempered." The structure is coherent and well-suited to the story's introspective nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a standout strength, with the "baroque asteroid" providing a rich, evocative atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. More importantly, the central object—the crystal vase shard—functions as a micro-setting that directly enables her choice to write and charges the final image. The environment is not merely backdrop but an active participant in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal—the search for purpose—and it deepens effectively under the story's textural pressure. However, the external conflict framing it, the "heated dispute with her colleagues," remains entirely off-page and abstract, providing no immediate pressure. While the escalation of internal turmoil is palpable, the lack of a concrete on-page opposition softens the overall tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story's themes of rediscovery and self-recreation are clear, but they are delivered through direct, overt statements rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The repeated thesis, "it was not just a civilization that she reimagined, but herself," functions as a thematic summary that undermines the story's resonance. This heavy-handed moralizing in the final act significantly weakens its impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the melancholic, literary tone. The third-person limited POV maintains a stable psychic distance, filtering the evocative setting through the character's specific, "poetically inclined" perceptions. The prose has a unique texture and rhythm that effectively supports the story's introspective mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant repetition and scaffold-like phrasing that dulls its momentum. Key phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "words flowing like a river" are repeated, and the central thematic statement is stated almost identically twice. These loops feel like authorial insistence rather than purposeful lyric refrains, creating prose artifacts that detract from the otherwise strong voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a defunct revolutionary turned poet-archaeologist on an asteroid where time is visible—is highly original and conceptually intriguing. This synthesis of genres creates a unique narrative space. However, the execution relies on somewhat familiar emotional arcs and overly explicit thematic statements, which tempers the full potential of its innovative setup.</comment>
