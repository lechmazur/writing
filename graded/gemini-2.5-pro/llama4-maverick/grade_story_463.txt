<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'dry-witted' trait is asserted but not demonstrated. The motivation ('to learn traditional methods') feels tacked on late and poorly integrated with the character's actions and discoveries, creating inconsistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot progression feels disjointed; the discovery of the tango secret doesn't logically flow from the initial focus on the rope/escape/eroding promises or the stated motivation. The ending resolution feels unearned and disconnected from the central revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the haunted lighthouse bedroom is effectively established with good sensory details (saltwater, dust). The setting supports the initial mood, but its connection to the later tango element feels less organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism (rope, tango) but lacks depth. The central conflict is unclear, shifting from the keeper's downfall to a love story secret. The theme of 'eroding promises' is introduced but overshadowed and underdeveloped. Relies more on telling than showing emotion/realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Shows signs of formulaic writing: the motivation feels externally imposed, the connection between confiscating a rope and learning traditional methods is illogical, and the shift to the tango feels like an abrupt plot device. Phrases like 'reckless precision' are repeated and feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate the assigned elements. The motivation, in particular, feels forced, making the narrative seem constructed around constraints rather than flowing organically. The brief length highlights the disjointedness rather than feeling deliberate.</comment>
