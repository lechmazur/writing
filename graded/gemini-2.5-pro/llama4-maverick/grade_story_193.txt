<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation (cure loneliness, improve lives) is stated but lacks depth and feels generic. The 'exiled prince' attribute is superficial, barely influencing actions or voice beyond providing a backdrop for isolation. His connection to the object is asserted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent (beginning/middle/end) within the word limit, driven by the snowstorm encounter. However, the resolution feels abrupt and overly convenient, diminishing the impact of the prince's established loneliness. Cause and effect are present but lack nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting (abandoned customs office) and object (mortar/pestle) are connected, and the atmosphere of dust and forgotten transactions is initially established. However, sensory details are sparse and generic ("old dust"). The tone ("familiar unknown") is stated but not consistently evoked through prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts thematic depth (connection vs. isolation) but relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an unexpected sense of connection," "felt a sense of peace") rather than showing. Symbolism (mortar/pestle, storm) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict (loneliness) is resolved too easily, weakening the overall impact and sense of earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative leans heavily on clich√©s (storm bringing strangers together for healing) and formulaic emotional beats. Language is functional but lacks freshness ("conversation flowing like the snow," "testament to the power of human connection"). Emotions are explicitly stated, lacking nuance. Feels predictable and lacks a distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story incorporates the elements, but their integration often feels superficial rather than organic (e.g., "unseen forces," "unintentionally iconic"). The narrative serves the elements rather than the elements serving a unique story. The brevity feels more like a constraint met than a deliberate stylistic choice enhancing impact. Lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
