<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("defy finality") and attribute ("analytically free") are stated but not convincingly demonstrated through action or internal thought; character feels like a vessel for assigned traits rather than a developed persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc (enter, discover, leave) but relies heavily on coincidence (goggles, briefcase together) and the core concept ("wilderness wisdom") feels disconnected from the immediate action; the link between the theatre closing and the repair bay is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay in the repair bay is adequately evoked with some sensory detail, but the assigned timeframe (post-theatre) feels arbitrary and disconnected from the setting and action; the stated tone ("prickly wonder") isn't fully realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on stating themes ("wilderness wisdom," "defy finality") rather than showing them emerge organically; symbolism (goggles) is explicitly declared, reducing impact; lacks subtext and genuine emotional resonance beyond surface-level curiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on repeating key assigned phrases ("wilderness wisdom," "laws of finality," "analytically free") feels artificial and formulaic; the combination of disparate elements (airships, braille, theatre, finality) lacks organic cohesion, suggesting template-filling rather than original vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story feels constructed *around* the assigned elements rather than using them naturally; abstract concepts like "finality" and "wilderness wisdom" are poorly integrated, hindering overall cohesion and leaving the narrative feeling superficial and contrived.</comment>
