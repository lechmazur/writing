<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The skipper's interiority is consistent and his motivation to protect the lighthouse's safety is clear. The central contradiction—a reticent man with a deeply felt, observant nature—is established well. However, his internal state is articulated with repetitive, slightly abstract diagnostic language ("luminescent ache"), which lessens the impact of his earned stasis at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is a sequence of observations and internal shifts that build toward a resonant conclusion. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where the skipper accepts his role and the emotional cost ("the luminescent ache"), is well-earned and lands with quiet force. Causality is emotional rather than event-driven, which is appropriate for the story's aims.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and functional, with the dark sea, the silent lantern room, and the rocky shore creating a potent atmosphere of isolation and responsibility. Key objects—the sea glass and the stones for the cairn—are not just descriptive but become central to the character's internal process and charge the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a setting that constrains or enables choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal: the skipper's struggle to preserve a sense of safety against an encroaching, sorrowful darkness. The pressure deepens effectively from the lamp's failure to the growth of the internal "ache." The climactic act of stacking stones is a meaningful, character-driven response that crystallizes his stance. The cost is made explicit—he will carry this ache—which gives the resolution weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds a coherent theme of finding meaning in stewardship and carrying collective sorrow. The final image of the skipper sailing away with his glowing sea glass is a resonant, non-literal answer to this. However, the theme is frequently over-stated, particularly with the repeated phrase "luminescent ache," which functions more as a label than an emergent feeling and slightly undermines the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a consistent, melancholic voice appropriate for the character. The skipper's perceptual signature is clear—he notices textures, subtle light, and the emotional weight of objects. While the prose rhythm is occasionally monotonous, the voice is distinct and holds steady under the story's emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. The phrase "luminescent ache" is used four times, and variations of "glow" appear repeatedly, creating a conceptual loop rather than an escalating feeling. This reliance on a single, heavily freighted phrase prevents the story from achieving the clean, resonant power it aims for, reading as a prose artifact that obscures the emotion it seeks to convey.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the "lonely guardian of the light" is a familiar archetype, the story combines it with less common elements like the stone-stacking language and the specific "luminescent ache." This synthesis offers a fresh angle on the trope. The primary weakness is the anonymous letter subplot, which feels like a generic mystery element that is introduced and then immediately abandoned, failing to integrate into the more personal, atmospheric core of the narrative.</comment>
