<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The 'necromancer' label feels entirely superficial and disconnected from the character's actions, thoughts, and motivations, which revolve around nostalgia and mapping. Motivation (reclaiming childhood via mapping) is clear but lacks depth and fails to integrate the character's supposed profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot is minimal, relying on internal reflection rather than significant external events. The 'dominate' action is stated as intent but not demonstrated. The structure is simple (map, remember, rumble, resolve), offering little development or satisfying arc within the word limit. Pacing is adequate but uneventful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described and contributes effectively to the atmosphere. However, the 'scarcely abundant' attribute is mentioned passively, and the 'futuristic nostalgia' tone feels contradictory and poorly executed – the nostalgia is present, but nothing feels futuristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a surge of resolve") rather than showing. The core concept 'sound of resolve' is repeatedly stated but feels abstract and forced, lacking subtlety. While there's an attempt at symbolism (cap, cave), the overall impact is diminished by cliché phrasing and a lack of compelling conflict or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The combination of elements has potential originality, but the execution leans on generic descriptions of emotion and common tropes (lost sibling, nostalgic object). Phrases like "thrummed with a pulse," "surge of resolve," and "heart beating in time" feel formulaic. The necromancer aspect feels particularly tacked on and inauthentic to the narrative presented.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story struggles for cohesion; elements like 'necromancer,' 'sound of resolve,' and 'futuristic nostalgia' feel poorly integrated and detract from the core emotional narrative about memory and loss. The story seems built *around* the prompts rather than using them organically. It lacks the depth and polish required for top-tier publication.</comment>
