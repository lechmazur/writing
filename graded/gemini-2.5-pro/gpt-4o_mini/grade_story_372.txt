<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'curiously indifferent' attribute clashes with the 'lovelorn' state and her immediate emotional reaction to Marcus; motivation appears abruptly near the end rather than driving earlier actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on the coincidence of Marcus appearing at the exact moment of tasting; the 'urban exploration' method is relegated to backstory and doesn't actively shape the present narrative arc. The 'reflection' concept is executed too literally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The futuristic slum setting is adequately evoked with neon and decay, creating atmosphere, but relies on fairly standard genre imagery rather than offering a unique vision. The connection between the label and setting is primarily contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (label, avalanche, reflection) feels heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Dialogue is functional but somewhat stiff and expository ("Gloating over your culinary triumph?"). The central conflict's resolution feels rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©s ("flickered like dying stars," "avalanche of betrayal," "symphony of spices," ghost of the past trope) without significant subversion. The prose lacks a distinctive voice and fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all assigned elements; 'urban exploration' and 'curiously indifferent' feel particularly tacked-on rather than organic, weakening the overall structure and impact.</comment>
