<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ("fuse ancient lore with modern dreams") is stated but not deeply explored or demonstrated through action beyond completing a crossword. Elara remains largely passive, reacting to atmosphere rather than driving events through her scholarly nature or stated amiability. Her internal shift feels more asserted than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The plot arc (unease to resolution) exists but feels underdeveloped and reliant on convenient symbolism (lighthouse beam = good news). The core action ("vibrate") triggers a shift, but the connection to the method ("stories told by... timbers") is tenuous. The resolution feels abrupt within the word count, lacking sufficient build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting ("haunted lighthouse signal room") is effectively established with good sensory details ("salt and old wood"), creating a suitable atmosphere. However, the assigned timeframe ("in the waiting room once good news arrives") is integrated awkwardly and nonsensically, disrupting the otherwise strong mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story employs symbolism (lighthouse, crossword) effectively, aiming for thematic depth (hope, resilience). However, it relies heavily on telling emotions ("she felt a sense of purpose") rather than showing, diminishing impact. The central conflict is internal but resolved too neatly via symbolic interpretation rather than character action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The narrative leans on familiar tropes (haunted setting, symbolic puzzle, internal epiphany) without significant subversion. Language occasionally dips into clich√© ("tapestry of hope and resilience"). The inclusion of the unexplained attribute "doubly singular" feels artificial and indicative of forced element integration, hindering originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While attempting cohesion, the story struggles to integrate all assigned elements naturally, particularly the timeframe and attribute, making it feel constructed around requirements rather than organically grown. The brevity highlights the somewhat unearned resolution and underdeveloped character arc. Style is competent but lacks distinction.</comment>
