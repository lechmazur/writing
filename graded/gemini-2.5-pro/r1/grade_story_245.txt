<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's grief and connection to the chopstick are palpable, but the assigned "irate" attribute feels underdeveloped beyond an initial mention and a single action (throwing the chopstick). Motivation stems more from grief/partner's memory than inherent character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness, moving from search to discovery within the word limit. However, the tea leaf reading feels more like character ritual than a necessary plot driver, and the waterfall's discovery, while resolving the quest, feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptionally strong, using evocative sensory details (crunching panels, bitter tea, roaring waterfall) to create a unique and desolate sci-fi setting that perfectly complements the character's internal state and the story's concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves, datapad, upward waterfall) and strong imagery create significant impact and subtext regarding grief, memory, and defiance. The central conflict is clear, and the theme of 'revolt' resonates, though the ending feels slightly sudden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally fresh and avoids clich√©s, with strong, specific imagery ("bones of derelict cargo drones," "gravity twisted like bad faith"). It largely avoids formulaic phrasing or overly stated emotion, demonstrating a distinct style, though one or two phrases verge on being slightly too explicit ("stupid, glorious revolt").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates disparate elements into a cohesive and evocative whole. The brief length feels intentional, creating a potent snapshot. The combination of sci-fi setting with quasi-mystical elements (tea reading, gravity-defying water) is creative and leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
