<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation (understand the past) is clear and linked effectively to the scalpel object, representing past trauma. However, the 'jaded bartender' attribute feels superficial; the narrative focuses almost entirely on her past as a surgeon and current role as a scientist, making the bartender aspect feel like tacked-on backstory rather than an integrated part of her present actions or persona beyond collecting receipts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot structure is efficient within the word limit, establishing a mystery (doodles), using the action (globalize search via receipts) and method (comparing doodles) to drive towards a climax (activating reactor, shattering crystal). It achieves a mini-arc, but the transition from disparate doodles to functional coordinates feels slightly abrupt, and the realization about other labs is introduced very late without much development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is vividly rendered and contrasts effectively with the implied grit of the character's past. The timeframe (before fireworks) creates excellent atmospheric tension and visual punctuation for the climax. Sensory details (violet light, pulsing geodes, azure flare, fleeting gold) are strong and enhance the mood of sterile discovery mixed with underlying tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery (geodes like hearts, sulfur air) and symbolism (scalpel, crystals, echoes). The central conflict regarding the past is clear, and the ending provides a purposeful, albeit open, resolution. The theme of confronting and fracturing the past to find answers emerges effectively. The writing generally shows rather than tells, enhancing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept blending crystal science, global synchronicity via doodles, and past trauma feels relatively original. However, some phrasing ("pulsed like dormant hearts," "clung like sulfur," "fractured timelines") borders on familiar sci-fi/noir tropes. While avoiding blatant AI tells, the rapid plot progression and instant pattern recognition lean towards narrative convenience over deep, nuanced character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates most assigned elements into a cohesive, albeit dense, narrative. The elements generally serve the story, particularly the setting, object, and motivation. The brevity feels intentional, creating a snapshot of a larger world. The combination of disparate elements (bartending, surgery, crystal science, global doodles) shows creative thinking, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
