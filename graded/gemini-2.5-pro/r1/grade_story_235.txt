<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The herbalist remains more of a symbolic cipher than a fully realized character. Her motivation is stated clearly but lacks deep personal grounding, making her actions feel driven by thematic necessity rather than internal complexity. Her 'voice' is minimal and indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot structure effectively uses the 'reposition' action across the 'art classes' timeframe to create a clear, albeit subtle, arc. The progression from observation to integration by the students is coherent and well-paced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a significant strength. The juxtaposition of the ancient castle, art school, ephemeral meteors, and pressed flowers creates a potent mood, strongly supporting the themes of time, decay, and creation. Sensory details are generally well-employed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story excels in its use of symbolism (flowers/stars, decay/creation) and thematic exploration of impermanence and beauty. It achieves subtext and leaves a contemplative impact. However, some phrasing ("forgotten psalm," "decay and creation are lovers") feels slightly self-conscious or overly literary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the core concept is original, the execution occasionally relies on familiar 'poetic' phrasing ("hummed with students," "light bleeding," "dissolving as the student gasped") that borders on clich√© or affectation. The emotional resonance is present but sometimes stated or described rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong sense of cohesion, successfully weaving the assigned elements into a thematically resonant narrative. The brevity feels intentional, fitting the vignette style. Its primary weakness lies in the slightly underdeveloped central character and occasional stylistic overreach.</comment>
