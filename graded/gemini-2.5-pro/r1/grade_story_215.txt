<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The 'rattled' aspect is established, but the 'inwardly social' attribute feels entirely superficial, stated by Voss rather than demonstrated. Character motivations (exorcist's redemption, Voss's ambition) are clear but archetypal, lacking nuance within the compressed narrative. The exorcist's voice is indistinct from the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is functional, achieving a full arc rapidly. However, the pacing feels excessively rushed, particularly the synthesis of clues and the resolution. Cause and effect are present but lack breathing room, making the progression feel more like a summary than an unfolding narrative. The puzzle method works but feels condensed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting is effectively atmospheric, blending science and the supernatural. Sensory details like humming machines and ozone add texture. However, the 'amid dance lessons' timeframe feels poorly integrated, serving mainly as an initial trigger and a final image rather than a pervasive element influencing the atmosphere or plot significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story successfully blends genres and uses evocative imagery (glowing tank, tangoing flames). It establishes a clear conflict and theme regarding past failures and the ethics of science. However, some literary devices verge on clich√© ("silk-wrapped steel"), and the final postcard message feels somewhat didactic, slightly undermining the subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding blatant AI tells like illogical jumps, the narrative relies heavily on familiar tropes (haunted protagonist, unethical scientist, damsel-in-distress variant) combined in a slightly predictable puzzle-box structure. The genre blend offers some originality, but the execution feels efficient rather than truly innovative or stylistically unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates competence in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive, albeit compressed, narrative. The elements largely serve the story, but the extreme brevity forces reliance on archetypes and rapid plot progression, limiting depth and emotional resonance. It feels more like a well-executed exercise than a fully realized piece.</comment>
