<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation ("Preserve what they tried to erase") is clear and drives her actions effectively, particularly her use of the "factually imaginative" attribute to decipher the code. However, the "aimless traveler" description feels dissonant with her immediate, focused purpose upon entering the archive; this initial trait isn't convincingly portrayed or reconciled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent within the word limit, moving logically from discovery (hopscotch) to action (deciphering) to climax/continuation (archivist). The method (hopscotch patterns) drives the plot effectively. However, the archivist's instant conversion after tasting the handkerchief strains credulity slightly, feeling overly convenient for narrative resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (dust, snowflakes, crumbling codices), creating a potent atmosphere of decay and hidden knowledge. This atmosphere effectively supports the "mournful elation" tone and the character's motivation. The snowflake timeframe adds a delicate urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery ("grilled the symbols," "chili sunsets") and potent symbolism (handkerchief, seeds, recipes as treaties). It successfully evokes emotion and explores themes of cultural preservation and resistance. The ending feels purposeful, opening up the narrative rather than simply closing it. The central conflict is clear and engaging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept of recipes as ciphers within a writing archive, decoded via hopscotch, is highly original. Metaphors are generally fresh. However, the archivist's immediate, dramatic reaction to tasting the ink ("瞳孔 dilating," ancestral flavors erupting) borders on cliché and feels somewhat forced, slightly undermining the otherwise nuanced handling of emotion and theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully integrates its disparate elements into a cohesive and resonant whole. The assigned elements largely serve the narrative's thematic goals rather than feeling like constraints. The brief length feels deliberate, concentrating the story's impact. It leaves the reader with a lingering sense of fragile hope and ongoing struggle.</comment>
