<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation feels inconsistent; shifts from 'truth via Morse' to 'love virus via pollen' linked to a lost lover. The 'unjustly fair' attribute is asserted but not convincingly demonstrated through action or internal thought. Character feels more like a collection of evocative traits than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses rapidly and hits key beats (inciting incident, climax, resolution) within the word limit. However, the causal link between the Morse code tapping (method) and the pollen infection (action's result) is tenuous, weakening coherence. The initial butterfly motivation feels somewhat abandoned for the love-virus plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details ('brass railing', 'gears gnashing', 'condensation-slick plating', 'corroded vents'). The atmosphere ('battered marvel') is effectively established and supports the melancholic, desperate tone and the core concept of unconventional love amidst decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (butterflies, highlighter, trench). The ending provides a sense of closure and thematic resonance ('Received'). However, the prose occasionally borders on overwrought ('lexicon of light', 'atmospheric guilt'), slightly undermining the impact. The central conflict is clear, but the theme's delivery feels slightly muddled by the motivational shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept combination is original. However, the density of metaphors and somewhat purple prose ('ink that stained the waves parliamentary blue', 'staccato heartbeats and rusted frequencies') can feel stylistically excessive rather than genuinely unique voice. Emotional nuance is present but sometimes stated ('spelling regrets') rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion despite disparate elements, largely due to strong atmosphere and evocative language. The elements feel mostly integrated, though the connection between the Morse code method and the infection action is weak. The brevity works, creating an intense snapshot. Leaves a lingering feeling, but minor inconsistencies detract from perfection.</comment>
