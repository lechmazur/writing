<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation via mannequins feels whimsical bordering on arbitrary for this level; the "smiling saboteur" aspect is stated but lacks deep integration into action or internal thought. Character voice is indistinct from narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and complete within the constraints, driven effectively by the action and concept. However, the mannequin method as the inciting/guiding force strains credulity without further grounding, slightly weakening overall coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is powerfully evocative and well-integrated with the action and object. Atmosphere is strong. The assigned timeframe ("throughout studying") feels tacked on and doesn't meaningfully contribute.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (imperfection, cracks). The core concept of broadcasting star memory is unique and impactful. The theme is clear. The final emotional note ("angry peace") feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept and combination of elements (astrophysics, mannequins, star broadcast) are original. However, some phrasing ("celestial fury," "billion-year loneliness") borders on purple prose, and the mannequin voices feel somewhat generic despite their novelty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion, using most elements effectively, particularly the setting and core concept. The brevity works. However, weaker integration of character attributes and the timeframe slightly undermines its potential as a flawless piece.</comment>
