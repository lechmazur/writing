<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Relies somewhat on the 'brooding artist' archetype; the Veyra relationship adds intrigue but remains underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a convenient, rapidly introduced fantastical element (dust mapping); "webs of intrigue" feel asserted rather than intricately demonstrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements and effective vignette structure, though hampered slightly by the narrative convenience of the central discovery mechanism.</comment>
