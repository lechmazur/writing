<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession as a ghostwriter is signaled early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("keeper of secrets," "thread that connects all things") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending reunion with the former client feels unmotivated—no prior causality establishes why he would appear with a matching spiral or what cost either pays. The transformation from private secret-keeper to public curator is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. "Inevitably whimsical" functions as a label without constraining a single choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric design with a patterned object). Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the reunion and final spiral placement), but the man's arrival reads as coincidence resolving the premise, not earned causality—he appears because the plot requires it, not because prior beats made his presence inevitable. The conceptual cost of "weaving and being woven" is asserted in the final paragraph rather than made legible through image or forfeited option. One meaningful deepening (nest → installation → reunion) is present, satisfying the length default, but the ending sacrifices causal rigor for lyric symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and walkway are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("soaked planks sighing," "droplets jeweled every petal"). The nest as micro-setting object constrains Elara's design choice and charges the final image when the man's spiral is added. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "prismatic quiet" recurs with tonal consistency, elevating atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the thread that connects all things—is signaled early but remains abstract. The installation creation offers one meaningful deepening, and the final reunion narrows options by converting client/ghostwriter into "two threads finally crossing." However, the man's arrival is pure coincidence, not protagonist agency, undercutting escalation. No visible cost is paid on the page; Elara gains connection without forfeiting secrecy, solitude, or any live option. The "willingness to weave and be woven" is declared rather than demonstrated through trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (connection, secrets made visible) emerges organically from the nest spiral and installation imagery. The final image of adding the man's spiral to the sculpture offers a non-literal answer with lyric resonance. However, the closing lines slip into explicit moralizing: "The thread that connects all things...was not one strand but the willingness to weave and be woven" and "a secret kept and now joyfully released" state the thesis rather than trusting the dramatized particulars. The "prismatic quiet" motif recurs purposefully but does not fully compensate for the thematic echo in the final paragraph (−0.5 for overt statement replacing scene pressure).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance is consistent. Perceptual signature ("seeing not just water but a spilled kaleidoscope," "inevitably whimsical") establishes voice, though "inevitably whimsical" repeats as a label rather than filtering perception distinctly. The single line of dialogue—"I never sent the letter, but I kept its essence"—reads slightly formal but brief enough to avoid major harm. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") appear moderately but do not drown immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language ("spilled kaleidoscope," "monument to instinctive craft") is vivid in the opening. However, template cadence runs appear: "She was a love letter ghostwriter, a keeper of secrets..."; "Each letter she had ever penned was a secret strand, yet they felt disconnected, like scattered beads." Paraphrase loops in the final third restate connection imagery without adding pressure. Stock metaphors ("blank page upon the world") and therapy-inflected phrasing ("hidden architecture of belonging") blur specificity. The closure beat is touched by abstract summary ("The thread...was not one strand but the willingness to weave") rather than concrete image, triggering the artifact-in-final-third cap and applying −0.8 in Q7 for template stems and loops. Information density is moderate; momentum sags in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—ghostwriter creates public art from a found nest—offers a fresh synthesis of profession and method. However, the emotional arc (solitary secret-keeper finds connection through shared art) follows a familiar template without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail. The man's convenient appearance with a matching spiral feels orchestrated rather than inevitable. "Prismatic quiet" and the lotus temple imagery are vivid but do not override the derivative journey from isolation to belonging. Moderate derivative-premise adjustment (−0.6) applied within Q8 for reliance on a widely used arc without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghostwriter profession is introduced early and motivates the shift from private to public secret-keeping, shaping one key turn (the installation idea). However, most of Elara's professional identity is reflective summary rather than on-page choice under pressure. The reunion references ghostwriting (the unsent letter) but the connection is told, not dramatized. Present by setup and development; minimal closure participation beyond thematic backdrop. Functional but largely replaceable with another helping profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twig spiral is handled in three beats: discovery on the walkway, placement at the installation's center in resin, and the man's matching spiral added at the end. It drives the installation decision, anchors the sculpture's design, and charges the final image. Early signal, causal pressure (enables the art project), and closure linkage are all present. Specificity (coiled design, "tiny monument to instinctive craft") matters. The element is essential across beats and ending, approaching indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Keeper of secrets" is introduced early and motivates the ghostwriting profession and the shift to public curation. It shapes one key turn (the decision to make connection visible) but functions primarily as thematic label rather than altering on-page tactics. The final revelation—secrets "kept and now joyfully released"—is asserted rather than demonstrated with visible cost. Present across setup, development, and closure; shapes one major beat with moderate causal pressure but remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Inevitably whimsical" appears three times as a character label ("her nature inevitably whimsical," "her whimsical attention," "her inevitably whimsical proposal") but never constrains or enables a choice with cost. It reads as authorial assertion rather than embodied trait affecting decision or perception. The flicker of attention to the nest could occur without whimsy; the installation proposal is approved without friction. Ornamental, no visible tradeoff, late closure cameo only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Rejoin" anchors the ending beat: the man approaches, they exchange spirals, and the text declares "they would rejoin, not as client and ghostwriter, but as two threads finally crossing." This action redefines the relationship and closes the installation sequence, satisfying closure participation. However, the reunion itself is enabled by coincidence (his unexplained arrival) rather than Elara's agency, and no cost is paid—she gains connection without forfeiting secrecy or solitude. Present in closure, drives the final image, but the lack of earned causality and visible price limits the score. Essential to the ending's thematic statement but undercut by convenience plotting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The public art installation is signaled midway ("an idea, both fanciful and profound, began to unspool"), developed through the collection and weaving phase ("worked quietly, weaving contributions into a large, sprawling sculpture"), and unveiled at the ending where it facilitates the reunion. The method shapes two beats (creation and unveiling) and enables the climactic encounter, satisfying development and payoff gates. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized—we do not see Elara negotiate permission, face material constraints, or navigate public reaction in real time. The installation functions as backdrop to the reunion rather than imposing its own cost. Present across middle and ending with moderate causal pressure; shapes the culmination but remains somewhat passive. Late signal (past the first third) applies −0.3; summary-only construction applies −0.4; still scores in the 6-range for dual-beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor the story's opening and closing images, provide the walkway where Elara discovers the nest, and supply the installation site. The setting is vividly described and recurs across beats, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraining choice—Elara could pursue the same idea in a park or gallery. The caretakers' approval is mentioned without friction. The "prismatic quiet" ties setting to tone, and the wet lilies return at the unveiling, offering a lyric reprise. Present in setup and closure with moderate atmospheric charge; one functional beat (nest discovery on walkway); modest causal pressure. Purposeful early-final reprise elevates the score into the mid-5s despite limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the cloud bursts" frames the opening and the story closes with "the sky cleared again," bracketing the narrative window. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—days pass in summary ("For days, she collected discards") without a clock pressuring tactics. The clearing sky at the unveiling is aesthetic rather than urgent. Present in setup and closure as lyric frame but does not constrain middle choices or escalate pressure. Ornamental use; minimal causal impact. Lyric reprise without mid-scene tactical role caps the score near 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the thread that connects all things" is stated early ("her motivation was personal") and drives the installation project, shaping one key turn. The final realization—"the thread...was not one strand but the willingness to weave and be woven"—closes the quest. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices, and no visible cost is paid to achieve the answer. Elara pursues the idea without friction or trade-off; the reunion grants connection without forfeiture. Present across setup, development, and closure; shapes one major beat with moderate thematic charge but lacks embodied struggle or price. Functional but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Prismatic quiet" appears in the opening description, returns at the unveiling ("prismatic quiet deepening as connections became palpable"), and closes the story ("The prismatic quiet settled around them, full of color and calm"). The tone remains coherent and modulates subtly—opening solitude, collective witness at the unveiling, shared intimacy at the end—without static repetition. The phrase charges the final image by linking atmospheric detail to thematic resolution. Early signal, purposeful recurrence, closure linkage present. The tone supports pressure accumulation under the lyric lens and reweights the ending with quiet intensity, elevating the score into the low-6s.</comment>
