<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's interior arc from desperation to discovery is tracked through embodied states (static shock, tingling thumb, breath catching). The affectionate skeptic trait appears as stated characterization rather than contradictory impulses in scene; his skepticism melts too smoothly into "willowglass hope" without visible struggle. The somatic memory method offers a fresh angle on interiority, but the final composite feels awarded rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose alternatives. Mara remains functional but off-page, applying no immediate relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered parallels (geode, neural arbor, light patterns) toward a conceptual repricing where "illumination" is redefined. Orientation anchors early (studio, Leo, workbench). The static shock → pill ingestion → somatic light painting sequence coheres, though the grant deadline and stalled project vanish without dramatic consequence. Closure reconfigures the opening tomb/womb metaphor with cost visible in the phrase "his hope, like willowglass, bent but did not break"—fragility acknowledged. One escalation tightening (desperation → attunement → composite) is sufficient under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The studio as sanctuary-turned-tomb anchors the opening and transforms to womb at closure, charging the final image. The workbench, camera, light wand, and monitor create a coherent micro-setting that constrains Leo's method. The muscovite geode sliver functions as both physical analog and motif anchor. Sensory detail is selective (tingling thumb, stray photon glimmer, cobalt blue light) and filtered through Leo's art-science perspective. No occupational implausibility detected; the light-painting technique reads credible within the conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the grant-driven breakthrough. Pressure tightens once (desperation → pill ingestion → somatic recall method → composite image), narrowing options from "elaborate dead ends" to a single viable path. The pill provides the method but not the insight; Leo's choice to close his eyes and surrender control drives the turn. Cost is primarily opportunity (the old approach abandoned) rather than a visible trade-off; the grant deadline looms but never forces a temporal choice on the page. Agency reads more as discovery than renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode/neural arbor/light painting triptych: complexity born from simple rules, embodied memory, illumination through darkness. The final image—"tracing the delicate, fractally precise patterns that darkness itself revealed"—reweights the opening's "failed ideas" without stating a moral. The willowglass metaphor (fragile, transparent, strong) charges the closure moment. One thematic friction: "affectionate skeptic" is told rather than shown through contradictory micro-choices, and "illuminate hidden pathways in cognitive architecture" reads as grant-speak rather than Leo's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction oscillates between Leo's embodied present ("ghost of the static shock still humming") and elevated register ("fractally precise," "somatic markers," "cognitive architecture") that reads more as prompt fulfillment than character voice. The phrase "willowglass hope—fragile, transparent, yet unexpectedly strong" in the final paragraph explains the metaphor rather than trusting the image. Filter verbs ("became aware," "realized," "understood") cluster in the turning beat, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He looked from… He had his key. For hours, he worked…" creates a list-like rhythm. The phrase "not a metaphor; it was a physical analog" and "not a setback; it was the catalyst" repeat the same negation structure within three sentences. "Affectionate skeptic by nature" and "willowglass hope—fragile, transparent, yet unexpectedly strong" offer scaffolding explanations. The opening sentence anchors voice well; the final beat delivers resonance but over-explains. Density is strong in the light-painting sequence; momentum sags slightly in the explanatory close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The somatic-marker-as-artistic-method synthesis offers a fresh angle on embodied cognition and art-science hybrids. The pill concept (telepathy recall turned somatic memory key) is inventive but explained rather than fully dramatized; its mechanics arrive late and resolve the stall cleanly. The geode/neural arbor parallel risks symbolic convenience—introduced early but its analog function is declared rather than discovered through failed attempts. The willowglass coinage adds texture. Risk is present in the conceptual frame but the execution plays safe in emotional arc and closure satisfaction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo is named and present throughout. "Affectionate skeptic" is stated in paragraph one but tested only once (dismissing the pill, then swallowing it under pressure). His final composite decision drives closure, but the skepticism-to-hope arc proceeds smoothly without on-page internal contradiction. Two beats: pill ingestion choice, surrender to somatic method. Causal role is clear; specificity of "affectionate" skeptic over generic skepticism is under-leveraged.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The geode appears in three beats: workbench introduction with Mara's metaphor, visual echo after the neural arbor image, and final talisman placement beside the monitor. Early signal (paragraph two) anchors expectation. Middle beat ("same branching, layered logic") links it causally to Leo's insight. Closure beat charges it as symbol but does not dramatize new use. Swappable with another fractal object (crystal, fern) with minor edits. Lyric resonance present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pill is seeded early (paragraph three), swallowed at the desperation turn (paragraph four), and its effect—somatic attunement—unlocks the entire method that generates the composite. It changes Leo's options from conceptual planning to body-led recall, narrowing his approach with visible cost (abandoning intention). The mechanics are told ("tying memory to the body's physical record") rather than shown through failed first attempts. Two beats: ingestion, attunement revelation. Essential to closure; the story fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears three times: Mara's geode description, the pill trial report, and the final paragraph's darkness patterns. It functions as thematic label more than constraint. No on-page action hinges on fractal precision versus other structural metaphors; Leo does not choose a fractal rendering over an alternative. The phrase charges the closure image but does not alter Leo's tactics. Present across beats but ornamental in causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors Leo's goal in paragraph one ("all he had devised so far were… dead ends") and returns in paragraph six ("using recalled somatic states… to devise light paintings"). The final composite is the product of devising. Two beats; the action frames the problem and solution. Swappable with "create" or "generate" without altering story logic. The verb fits Leo's technical idiom but does not impose unique constraints or costs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Somatic markers are seeded as the pill's mechanism (paragraph four: "access through somatic markers… tying memory to the body's physical record"), tested in the shock-recall beat (paragraph five: "His body remembered the jolt… his nerves guide the light"), and extended across multiple memories in paragraph six. The method shapes Leo's entire approach after the pill and is indispensable to the composite. Three beats with causal pressure. Specificity matters: the method cannot be replaced with visual or verbal recall without breaking the neural-arbor logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The studio is named and anchored early (paragraph one: "sanctuary of controlled photons… tomb for failed ideas") and transforms to "womb for a new kind of seeing" at closure. The workbench, camera, monitor, and long-exposure setup provide the tactical environment for Leo's method. The setting does not constrain his choices (he could work elsewhere) but supplies the tools and charges the tomb/womb metaphor. Two beats: opening anchor, closure transformation. Lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The static shock anchors the timeframe in the title phrase (paragraph one) and provides the somatic memory Leo recalls in paragraph five. The shock itself occurs off-page before the story opens; the "after" frame is stated but does not tighten decisions. No clock pressure from the grant deadline, which is mentioned once and then ignored. One causal beat: shock as the recalled event. The timeframe is present but passive; easily replaceable with "after the failed experiment" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Leo's motivation—"to illuminate hidden pathways in cognitive architecture"—is stated in paragraph one and visualized in the final composite (paragraph seven: "the hidden pathways of embodied memory"). The phrasing reads as grant language rather than Leo's lived desire; no on-page choice forces him to choose illumination over safety, speed, or recognition. The motivation frames the goal but does not create visible friction or cost. Two beats: opening statement, closure fulfillment. Functional but told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is introduced in paragraph six ("affectionate skepticism melted into willowglass hope—fragile, transparent, yet unexpectedly strong") and returns in the final sentence ("his hope, like willowglass, bent but did not break"). The coinage is vivid and the metaphor apt, but tone modulation across the piece leans more toward discovery and resolve than sustained fragility. The final image charges the metaphor with cost (bent but not broken), reweighting the opening despair. Two beats; lyric reprise present. Swappable with "tentative hope" without major loss.</comment>
