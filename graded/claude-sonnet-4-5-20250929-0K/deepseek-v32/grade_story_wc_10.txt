<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation is clear and her goal pursuit is consistent throughout. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract emotion-mapping rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "realization" that she must map the conservatory's emotions reads as a prompt-convenient epiphany rather than emerging from prior internal contradiction. Embodied emotion is present but often filtered through the device's read-out rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the silent music achieved), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path is dramatized on the page. The mid-story turn (realizing she needs the conservatory's emotions) functions as a micro-adjustment rather than a tightening that narrows options. The ending image is evocative but the felt price is diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (perpetual rime, frost-fall, crystalline spire). The Unshaken Marvel and the conservatory's spatial layout guide Elara's movements and constrain her method. The environment charges the final image when ice flowers chime and frozen dewdrops dance. Micro-setting (the spire, the heat-map device on her wrist) functions as setting and constrains choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence into music) is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes she must integrate the conservatory's emotions with her own. However, this turn is more cognitive than a narrowing of options or forfeiture; the protagonist does not face a trade-off or visible cost—she simply adjusts her method and succeeds. Coincidence does not resolve, but the escalation reads as problem-solving rather than pressure that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty and communication persisting beyond conventional forms) emerges organically from the silence-into-music quest and the "unshaken marvels" motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer—hearing with the heart—but it arrives through a stated insight ("a new way to hear, not with ears, but with the heart") rather than purely through image. Subtext is present in the visual symphony, yet the final paragraph edges toward moralizing the theme rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("the roaring void the Capsize had left in her soul"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("rectify," "modulate") that feels slightly external to a survivor's immediate perception under stress. The narrative voice is consistent and the perceptual signature (filtering through heat-maps and emotional memory) is character-specific, though some beats lean toward exposition rather than enacted thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the heat-map's function is explained twice in adjacent beats, and "silently expressive" recurs as a label without new pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in the "She [verb]" openings across multiple beats. No figurative muddle in peak moments, and the final image avoids scaffold, but mid-story transitions carry some redundancy that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core premise (translating silence into music via emotion heat-mapping in a post-sound world) offers a fresh synthesis of sensory deprivation and synesthetic invention. The tuning fork case and the Unshaken Marvel are specific anchors. However, the emotional arc and the problem-solution sequence (initial attempt, epiphany, adjusted attempt, success) follow a familiar template. The Capsize backstory and the conservatory's role feel ornamental rather than causally essential; swapping the disaster or the plants would not break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara as capsize survivor is present in backstory and frames her motivation, but the survivor trait does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice with visible cost. The trauma is mentioned ("the aftermath of the capsizing trauma she carried") but does not create friction in her tactics or force a trade-off at closure. Setup and middle beats acknowledge the attribute; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in three beats: initial carry, selection of the A440 fork, and final closure when Elara closes the case. The case frames the quest and returns with reweighted meaning at the end ("her mission rectified"). However, the case itself does not create causal pressure or narrow options; the forks are tools rather than objects whose properties shape tactics. Solid lyric reprise but mid-integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "unshaken marvels" concept appears as a label for the spire and as a thematic echo in the final paragraph. It does not demonstrably shape stakes or alter tactics on the page; Elara's method would work identically if the spire were named otherwise. The concept reads ornamental—a thematic veneer rather than a driver of choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is mentioned twice: once describing Elara's gestures and once the conservatory's heat-map. The trait does not constrain or enable a key action with visible cost. It functions as atmospheric description rather than a mechanic that alters what Elara can or cannot do. No dramatized trade-off tied to this attribute at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rectify" is the action verb threading the piece: Elara seeks to rectify dissonance, then rectifies the emotional imbalance between her turmoil and the conservatory's calm, and the ending declares "her mission rectified." The action shapes two distinct beats (initial attempt, corrected attempt) and is present in the closure image. Replacing "rectify" with a generic synonym would weaken thematic coherence; the term's precision (restore balance/harmony) is causally relevant to her method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early, its mechanics explained, and it drives both the failed first attempt and the successful second attempt. The method shapes Elara's tactics (focus on her own emotions, then extend sensors to the conservatory). The device appears in three beats and participates in closure when the combined emotional signature solidifies into gold. However, the mechanics are somewhat convenient—the adjustment succeeds immediately without further complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory provides spatial grounding, atmospheric detail, and the Unshaken Marvel as a focal object. It supplies the "botanical calm" that Elara must integrate with her turmoil. The conservatory's energy is the problem Elara diagnoses and resolves, and the final visual symphony occurs within its bounds. However, the conservatory could be swapped for another mystical greenhouse without breaking the core logic; its specificity (winterglass, perpetual rime) is vivid but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" is established early and shapes the entire premise: Elara's quest to create music in a soundless world. The constraint is consistent and alters what success looks like (visual symphony instead of audible music). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the scene—Elara's attempts are not racing a clock or facing temporal pressure. The constraint is static backdrop rather than escalating urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" drives every beat and is dramatized through two attempts. Friction arises when the first method fails, forcing adjustment. However, the want is not shown in tension with a competing fear or need—Elara's internal conflict (grief, anxiety) is diagnosed via heat-map rather than enacted as contradictory impulses. The motivation shapes action but lacks the layered cost or renunciation that would elevate integration into the high band.</comment>
