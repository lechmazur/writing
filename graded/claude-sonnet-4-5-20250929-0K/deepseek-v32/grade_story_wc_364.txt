<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to coax resilience from rubble") is declared and repeated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior texture relies heavily on abstract labels—"quietly determined," "azure defiance"—without embodied perception or specific physical responses under stress. The final kneeling gesture and "quiet triumph" land as performed rather than earned from prior micro-choices, and no genuine cost forecloses a path on the page. Backstory fragments (bartered awakenings, traded memories) anchor poorly in present stimuli and do not alter tactics in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who-where-when anchors emerge gradually across the first several paragraphs without a clear teaching pattern, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—energy surge, arches knit, orchards revive—reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost (exhaustion, traded memories) was pre-paid off-page rather than dramatized at the climax, reducing felt consequence. The lens appears Causal but linkage is weak: the ritual steps (spread silk, arrange stones, chant) do not narrow options or raise immediate stakes; success arrives without on-page reversal or visible trade-off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly sketched ("skeletal remains against the sky," "cavern walls glittered with embedded crystals"), and the mine shafts provide spatial grounding. The magician's silk charges the closure image by glowing and pulsing with the planet's heartbeat, meeting the micro-setting test. However, environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Kael moves through the tunnels and cavern without navigating obstacles or adjusting tactics based on spatial pressures. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered but largely ornamental in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planetary survival—is signaled early and remains coherent. One deepening occurs when Kael stands "between understanding and confusion," glimpsing renewal yet doubting its reality, but this remains internal and does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page. The ritual's success lacks visible cost at the closure beat: exhaustion is declared, but no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. Coincidence does not resolve, yet protagonist agency is passive—Kael performs a borrowed ritual without adapting under pressure or risking immediate failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme—resilience woven from loss, hope chosen between understanding and confusion—emerges from concrete particulars (traded memories, crumbling arches, revitalized orchards). The final image of azure skies and renewed orchards offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the penultimate line ("some awakenings are worth the barter") edges toward thematic summary, and the piece leans on repeated prompt phrases ("bartered awakenings," "coax resilience from rubble") as motifs without transforming them through fresh inflection. The thematic question is coherent but not deepened by the protagonist's journey; the cost was pre-paid, not discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Voice is coherent but generic, lacking a perceptual signature: Kael notices moss glow, damp earth, metal scent, yet diction remains neutral and does not reflect blacksmith idiom or bias. Register drifts toward elevated abstraction ("azure defiance," "bartered awakenings," "choreography of entropy") in beats where simpler, embodied language would serve pressure. The chanted ritual words ("alien on his tongue, sounds from a forgotten time") are told rather than shown, missing an opportunity for voice-specific texture. Dialogue is absent; no test applied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates across multiple paragraphs: "He [verb]…," "The [noun] [verb]…," "Kael [verb]…" runs flatten rhythm and information density (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur—"bartered awakenings" mentioned five times, "coax resilience from rubble" twice, "azure defiance" three times—without added meaning (−0.3). Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "skeletal remains," "lifeblood," "breathed again." The final third contains figurative density ("azure defiance radiating," "knit together, stone fusing with stone") that edges toward purple in a high-pressure beat without pattern-taught payoff (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—blacksmith performs planetary-scale ritual with bartered memories—combines familiar fantasy beats (dying world, ancient knowledge, sacrifice) without a fresh synthesis. The "bartered awakenings" and "azure defiance" phrases recur as prompt labels rather than being transformed through character-specific detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (meek → quietly determined → exhausted triumph) follows a predictable template. The magician's silk and mine shafts serve functional roles but do not offer surprising specificity or ironic cost. The ending vision of renewal lacks a counter-reading or complicating pressure that would invite lingering reflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is introduced early (setup ✓) and present at closure (payoff ✓), but his meekness does not constrain a key choice in the middle or at the climax. The ritual proceeds without internal resistance or a moment where meekness must be overcome. The character is functional but the defining trait is ornamental; a confident blacksmith could execute the same arc with minor edits. Missing middle development and swappable trait cap eligibility; lyric reprise (opening meekness, closing triumph) earns modest lift but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magician's silk appears early (setup ✓), is handled in the cavern ritual (middle ✓), and charges the closure image by pulsing and radiating energy (payoff ✓). It enables the ritual and appears in three distinct beats, meeting beat-involvement and closure-linkage tests. However, the silk does not impose a visible cost or narrow options—its use is straightforward, and it "lay inert, its purpose fulfilled" without complication. Specificity (deep blue, shimmering, Entity-given) adds texture but does not make the object irreplaceable; another conduit could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings are mentioned repeatedly as backstory and thematic claim but do not shape on-page tactics or narrow a present choice. The concept frames the premise (setup ✓) and is invoked at closure ("some awakenings are worth the barter"), but the actual exchange occurred off-page and does not create friction or cost in the ritual scene. Missing middle development: the concept is told rather than dramatized through a live trade-off. Swappable with "sacrificed knowledge" or similar phrasing; lack of causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" is labeled in the opening and final paragraphs but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted ("Kael felt a quiet determination grow," "his quietly determined spirit unwavering") rather than shown through a choice where silence or restraint forecloses an option. Setup and payoff mentions are present, but middle development is absent—no scene where quietness or determination alters tactics or creates friction. Label-only use and swappability (a "resolute" or "steadfast" blacksmith would function identically) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Deliberate" is invoked frequently ("deliberate care," "deliberate hands," "final deliberate gesture") as a modifier for Kael's actions throughout (setup ✓, middle ✓, payoff ✓). The trait shapes the ritual's pacing—arranging stones, chanting, pressing hands—across multiple beats. However, deliberateness does not impose a cost or narrow options; haste is never a temptation, so the choice to proceed slowly remains decorative. The action is present and consistent but swappable with "careful" or "methodical" without altering structure. Missing causal pressure and irreplaceability cap the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mine shafts are signaled early ("abandoned mine shafts beneath the surface," "his method to reach the planet's faltering heart") (setup ✓), navigated in the middle beats (development ✓), and function as conduits for the climactic energy surge (payoff ✓). The method appears in three beats and enables the resolution. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown: no on-page obstacle tests the choice to use shafts over an alternate route, and the conduit function is asserted ("directing the planet's own latent strength") rather than dramatized through visible cost or tactical adjustment. Swappable with "ancient tunnels" or similar; lack of friction and specificity limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are introduced early (setup ✓), provide vivid imagery throughout ("skeletal remains," "glittered with embedded crystals") (middle ✓), and frame the closure image ("azure skies arching over renewed orchards") (payoff ✓). The setting charges the final image and supplies the dominant stake (planetary survival). However, the environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Kael moves through the mine without navigating obstacles or adjusting tactics based on spatial pressures. The arches and orchards function thematically but remain postcard description in execution; beat involvement and closure linkage earn mid-band placement, but lack of tactical constraint prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" is labeled as the timeframe in the opening and invoked once mid-ritual ("confusion crept in; was this truly restoration, or merely a fleeting dream?"). The concept does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Kael proceeds through the ritual without time pressure or a moment where confusion forces a tactical shift. The timeframe is ornamental—mentioned but not dramatized—and easily removable without structural impact. Missing middle development and closure participation; vague use caps the score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to coax resilience from rubble" is stated early (setup ✓), repeated mid-ritual (middle ✓), and invoked at closure (payoff ✓). It frames the dominant stake and appears in three beats. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice: Kael never faces a moment where coaxing resilience costs him an alternative goal or forces a trade-off on the page. The motivation is functional and consistent but lacks friction or visible price; a generic "save the world" drive would function identically. Beat involvement and closure linkage earn mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure and swappability prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" is labeled repeatedly ("tone of his mission was azure defiance," "azure defiance radiating," "defiance a permanent azure hue") across setup, middle, and payoff. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (calm rebellion → radiating energy → permanent sky color). However, the phrasing is decorative and does not charge the final image with new meaning; "azure" functions as color description, "defiance" as thematic label. The tone is told rather than embodied through syntax, diction shift, or ironic counter-pressure. Swappable with "quiet rebellion" or similar; label-only use and lack of specificity cap the score mid-low band.</comment>
