<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and character-specific—the "cold stone in his chest" and carrying the watch hand as a physical token ground his guilt. His profession manufacturing false memories while seeking his own truth creates genuine internal contradiction. However, the final revelation (Aris as father) lands as pure disclosure rather than emerging from Kael's active choices under pressure; he receives information passively from Elara without meaningful resistance or cost. The "fragile peace" ending feels declared rather than embodied through a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors clearly (cobalt terrace, dusk, Kael's profession) within the first paragraph. The journey to the shore → carving discovery → Elara visit traces a because/therefore chain, but the central turn (learning Aris was his father) is purely revelatory—Elara simply tells him. No on-page decision or renunciation alters Kael's options; the "heavy, mournful acceptance" is asserted rather than enacted. The cost (carrying the watch hand, feeling "tempered regret") exists but remains atmospheric rather than decisive. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the reconfiguration itself is delivered by exposition, weakening its on-page presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, gray shore, slick stone, and dense pines create vivid spatial grounding. The watch hand functions as micro-setting—its physical presence in Kael's pocket and palm constrains his quest and charges the final beat. Sensory detail (wind's "sieved hush," water-bleached plank, numb fingers) is purposeful and filtered through urgency. The terrace recurs as both literal place and symbolic anchor, reweighted at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (terrace, shore, Elara's apartment) without confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering Aris's withheld truth—is signaled early and sustained. The shore search provides one meaningful tightening (finding the carving), but escalation plateaus once Kael decodes the message. The climactic confrontation with Elara is purely informational; no resistance, competing pressure, or trade-off complicates the disclosure. Kael's agency is investigative rather than decisional—he pursues, finds, and receives rather than choosing between competing goods or unavoidable harms. The "weight of a withheld truth" equals "the burden of love, shaped by fear" is thematically resonant but lacks on-page cost at the moment of discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the genealogist-of-shadows premise: manufactured pasts versus hidden truths, the cost of withheld love, guilt as inheritance. The watch hand and driftwood carvings function as concrete particulars that accrue meaning without overt symbolism. The final image—"the watch hand clasped tight, the tempered regret in his heart no longer a barrier, but a testament"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "precisely equal to the burden of love, shaped by fear" edges toward thesis statement, though it remains embedded in Kael's perception rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization remains with Kael throughout. Diction ("genealogist of the shadows," "sieved hush," "tempered regret") carries a distinct, slightly elevated texture that fits the noir-inflected premise. Perceptual signature is selective—hands "the color of old bruises," Aris's "trembled hand," the watch hand "burning a hole in his pocket"—and character-specific. Elara's single line of dialogue ("He said you'd come... He carried the guilt for both of you") lands naturally. Minor register drift: "grotesque parody," "reclusive woman," and "mournful acceptance" occasionally tilt toward authorial lexicon rather than Kael's working idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor issues: "The specific truth was his own: what his mentor, Aris, had refused to tell him the night he vanished" is a scaffold clarification that could be tightened. "The manufactured false memories he had sold to others felt like a grotesque parody of his own quest for one real, hidden fact" is slightly overwritten. "The sieved hush of the shore was inside him now, a quiet where the storm of questions had been" stacks metaphors without full coherence. No loops or template cadence, but figurative density in the final paragraph ("full mass of the truth settle upon him," "no longer a barrier, but a testament") approaches saturation without quite crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The black-market genealogist who manufactures false memories while seeking his own hidden origin is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The driftwood-carving cipher and the watch hand as inheritance token feel fresh. However, the "mentor was secretly the father" revelation is a familiar archetype, and the emotional arc (guilt → disclosure → acceptance) follows a relatively conventional path. The noir-inflected voice and the "sieved hush" motif add texture, but the core structure (investigative quest → informational climax → thematic realization) does not transform the template through lived detail or moral calculus that surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his profession (manufacturing false memories) frames the thematic irony. His choices—driving to the shore, sifting driftwood, tracing Elara—create narrative progression. However, the key turn (learning Aris was his father) is not Kael's decision but Elara's disclosure. His final "understanding" and "fragile peace" are receptive rather than agentive. Two gates: setup (paragraph one) and closure participation (final image with watch hand). Development gate is weak—he investigates but does not choose between competing goods. Integration: early signal +0.5, two beats (shore search, Elara visit) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, minus swappability (another seeker archetype) −0.5, minus passive climax −0.8. Band ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in three beats: Aris's trembling hand holding it in backstory, Kael carrying it "burning a hole in his pocket," and clasped tight in the final image. Its broken state and origin (the night Kael was born) charge it with specific meaning that shapes the closure. Three gates: setup (paragraph two backstory), development (mentioned as Kael carries it), payoff (final image). Integration: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (broken, from birth night) +0.6, cost connection (inheritance token) +0.4, minus one beat is backstory-only −0.4, minus mid-section absence −0.2. Band ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears twice: at the shore ("wind carried a sieved hush") and internalized at closure ("The sieved hush of the shore was inside him now"). It functions as atmospheric metaphor but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Two gates: development (shore scene) and payoff (final internalization). Setup gate missing—no signal in first third. Integration: lyric reprise +0.5, closure presence +0.4, minus late first appearance (second third) −0.3, minus ornamental use (does not shape action) −0.8, minus swappability (could be "filtered quiet" or "muffled peace") −0.6. Cap for missing setup gate: 4.6. Band ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Kael's profession (manufacturing false memories) is signaled in paragraph one and creates thematic irony—he sells fabricated pasts while seeking his own hidden truth. However, this attribute does not enable or constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. It frames his guilt but does not shape tactics at the shore or alter his approach to Elara. Two gates: setup (paragraph one) and thematic payoff ("grotesque parody" line). Development gate weak—no mid-scene choice depends on this skill. Integration: early signal +0.6, thematic linkage +0.4, minus label-only use (no dramatized tradeoff) −0.8, minus swappability (another illicit profession would serve) −0.5. Band ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Quell" appears explicitly ("to quell the constant, gnawing uncertainty") and implicitly (the quest to quiet the "storm of questions"). The shore journey is an attempt to quell; the final "sieved hush... inside him now" is the realization that quelling equals acceptance. Three gates: setup (first paragraph), development (shore search as quelling attempt), payoff (final quiet). Integration: early signal +0.7, two beats (shore, closure) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus summary-only at closure (the quelling is declared, not enacted through a choice that forecloses a path) −0.7, minus swappability ("resolve," "settle," "ease") −0.6. Band ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's method (sifting driftwood carvings) is signaled in paragraph one, executed at the shore (paragraph two), and yields the key clue (carved date and longitude). Three gates: setup, development (the sifting shapes his search), payoff (the carving points to Elara). Integration: early signal +0.7, two beats (shore search, discovery) +0.9, causal pressure (the carving enables the next move) +1.0, specificity (private code between Kael and Aris) +0.5, minus the method does not constrain later choice (once decoded, it's pure information) −0.4, minus absent from closure beat −0.8. Band ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk frames the story (opening and implied return in "on the cobalt terrace once more, in the fresh dusk of a new day"). It anchors mood and recurs with reweighted meaning, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Two gates: setup (paragraph one) and lyric reprise (paragraph four mention). Development gate weak—no mid-scene choice depends on the terrace. Integration: early signal +0.6, lyric reprise +0.5, closure linkage +0.4, minus ornamental use (postcard atmosphere) −0.7, minus swappability (another liminal space would serve) −0.5. Band ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" functions as thematic frame rather than plot clock. Time passes (hours at the shore, dawn return, "fresh dusk of a new day") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Two gates: setup (first paragraph) and thematic payoff (final paragraph). Development gate missing—no mid-scene deadline. Integration: early signal +0.5, thematic presence +0.4, minus vague tracking (no live clock or escalating pressure from time) −0.9, minus swappability (another metaphor for emotional burden) −0.6, cap for missing development gate: 3.4. However, the "weight" recurs at closure with felt presence, lifting slightly via lyric resonance. Band ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (discovering the weight of Aris's withheld truth) is stated in paragraph one and drives the entire quest. Three gates: setup, development (shore search and Elara visit), payoff (the truth is revealed and its weight is felt). Integration: early signal +0.8, three beats (initial framing, shore, Elara) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (the "heavy, mournful acceptance") +0.5, minus passive reception at climax (Elara tells him rather than Kael choosing between competing wants) −1.0, minus the desire is stated more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices −0.6. Band ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is signaled early ("guilt was a cold stone") and modulates across the journey: initial guilt, the shore's "despair," Elara's "tempered regret," and the final "mournful acceptance" where "tempered regret in his heart no longer a barrier, but a testament." Three gates: setup, development (shifts at each location), payoff (final reconfiguration). Integration: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.3, tone coherence under pressure +0.8, specificity (not generic sadness but guilt-laden, evolving sorrow) +0.6, minus single static register in Elara scene (no friction, only confirmation) −0.3. Band ~7.8.</comment>
