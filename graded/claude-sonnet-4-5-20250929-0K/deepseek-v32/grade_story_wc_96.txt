<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent—forge beauty from anarchy, honor Leo—but his monthly personality molts remain entirely told rather than shown as internal pressure. The embodied work (lifting, sorting) creates some physical grounding, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("a stubborn coal in his chest," "spirit was curiously light") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift toward "something new and steady had taken root" reads as asserted growth without visible cost or foreclosed path; the molt that would test commitment never arrives on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates charged images (moon, fracture, poems, library transformation) and sustains coherent pressure toward a sanctuary carved from wreckage. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "part of him remained, rebuilding forever" crystallizes the stance with undeniable pressure, though the cost—what molting personality might erase—remains more conceptual than felt on the page. Orientation is immediate (Silas, rusted library, night) and causality links Leo's prison friendship to tonight's promise, though the middle section loops through similar beats (straighten, sort, reflect) without a decisive tightening or reversal that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (corrugated roof sighing, oxidized metal, moon bleaching rust to silver) and the environment constrains Silas's choices: he works shelf by shelf, uses the stone table, rights a small chair in the children's corner. The moon as timekeeper and the library's physical transformation charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting's decay-to-sanctuary arc integrates tightly with the thematic fracture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: rebuild the library as a promise to Leo and an act of resistance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the night's work, but the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Silas never encounters obstacles, setbacks, or trade-offs that force a harder choice. The work proceeds methodically without escalation, and the molt's potential to erase this project is announced but never tests his commitment on the page. Cost remains abstract ("itching to shed") rather than forcing a visible tactical shift or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" and "luminous fracture" emerge concretely through the library's transformation and moonlit imagery, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image—"resistance, blooming in the dark, ready for the next day's light"—offers a resonant answer to whether broken things can house wholeness. However, thematic language ("forge beauty from anarchy," "quiet defiance," "garden in a bomb crater") repeats in similar register across beats, edging toward redundancy rather than deepening through new particulars in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Silas; perceptual signature is consistent (poet's eye for metaphor, builder's focus on physical work). Diction remains controlled and lyric throughout ("moon bleaching the rust to silver," "library's ribs strengthened by care"), with purposeful compression that teaches a pattern early. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent, and the final shift to someone-else-but-same reads intentional rather than a lapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the middle section loops through paraphrase: "blooming resistance" appears as metaphor, then "resistance bloomed in his muscles," then "blooming resistance meant tending a garden," then "the resistance, blooming in the dark"—four near-synonymous articulations without added pressure. Template cadence runs in "He would rebuild… He would return… He carried" sequence. Figurative language is vivid ("moon cleared the skyline," "luminous fracture") but the density in peak beats (final paragraphs) stacks metaphors without always advancing the image. Minor clarity slip: "molting personalities" versus "monthly molt" toggled without settled term.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vagrant poet who rebuilds a rusted library as resistance is a purposeful synthesis, and the coffee tin's false bottom holding poems rather than seeds is a memorable detail. However, the core frame—solitary character performs restorative labor as redemption/promise—maps closely to familiar redemption-through-craft templates. The piece transforms through specific lyric texture and the Leo friendship anchor, but the emotional arc (broken man finds purpose, feels lighter, vows continuity) follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious turn or moral calculus that redefines the premise.</comment>
