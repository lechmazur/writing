<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear (find lost time) and her quest involves agency, but her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed" repeated as labels rather than embodied states). The final shift from seeking to holding is asserted more than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional progression reads as tidy resolution rather than the messy interplay of fear and love under real pressure. The Quick Test fails: contradictory impulses are summarized, not dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode with a lyric frame: midnight glade → crystallized moments → healed saucer → new tablecloth ritual. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (onyx-ink cartomancer, midnight glade, after birth). A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted—Elara's understanding shifts from seeking external reservoir to internal forgiveness—but the cost is asserted ("she could not reclaim the lost hours") rather than viscerally demonstrated. The closure image (tracing hands, healed saucer) reweights prior material, but the price feels conceptual and distant, not immediate. Cost Proof Test: the final beat tells us "she was no longer seeking, but holding" without showing what concrete path was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is vividly rendered ("choking beauty," "silvery wraiths," "hanging garden of crystallized seconds") and establishes a distinct atmosphere. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting, returning whole at the end to signal transformation. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara's passage through the door and "unfastening" of her regret proceed without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The Quick Test fails: the glade does not constrain a choice, and the final image depends more on thematic assertion than environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find where lost time accumulates) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara steps through the luminous door and faces her own regrets, but the "unfastening" action and the saucer's healing feel resolved by narrative fiat rather than protagonist struggle. The crystallized seconds vault presents no obstacle that Elara must overcome through trade-off; she simply "began to unfasten the knot" and the saucer heals. The escalation under Accumulative lens requires a deepening that changes options or knowledge with cost; here the cost is told ("true contrition") rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A coherent theme emerges: lost time accumulates in the spaces of love and fear, and healing requires facing regret. The cracked saucer and hand-tracing custom are recurring images that shift meaning by the end. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("It accumulated not in some distant realm, but in the forgiveness woven into daily ritual"). The Quick Test is borderline: the ending offers a resonant answer (new tablecloth, healed saucer) but the last lines spell out the lesson rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "cloudbound repentance") throughout, creating a coherent voice. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the sacred pause between heartbeats") and some phrases recur as labels ("choking beauty" appears four times, "willingly perplexed" three times) without evolving their meaning. The prose reads as purposeful compression, but the perceptual signature is more stylistic consistency than character-specific bias. No dialogue appears on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but overwriting and loop patterns appear. "Choking beauty" recurs four times, "cloudbound repentance" five times, and "willingly perplexed" three times as stock phrases rather than fresh observations. Paraphrase loops: "She knew where lost time accumulated" → "It accumulated not in some distant realm" within two beats. Template cadence in the final third: "She was no longer seeking, but holding. The glade had taught her... The memory of the choking beauty would linger... And in that custom, she found..." (four parallel declaratives). Density penalty (−0.5), loop penalty (−0.4), cadence penalty (−0.5) cumulative in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat, so apply −1.7 total and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise (cartomancer seeking lost time in a cloudbound glade) offers a lyric fantasy frame, and the hand-tracing custom is a specific detail. However, the emotional arc (fear of motherhood reconciled through mystical journey) follows a familiar template of symbolic quest → self-acceptance. The "cracked object healed by understanding" motif and the "true treasure was inside you all along" resolution are well-worn. The piece commits fully to its premise and the prose texture is consistent, but the core insight and final turn feel derivative rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (onyx-ink cartomancer) is present throughout and her quest drives the plot. She makes two key choices: climbing the crag and stepping through the luminous door. However, both decisions are narrated as inevitable steps in her quest rather than conflicted choices with visible cost. The "unfastening" action is summarized ("she began to unfasten the knot") without dramatized hesitation or trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but her agency is more thematic vehicle than lived decision-making under pressure. Late-middle functional use: ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dolls' tea set saucer crack is handled in three beats: packed at the start, placed within the traced palm and pulsing with grey light, and returning whole at the end with the crack "healed into a mere hairline of silver." The object is causally active (the fracture widens to become "a portal within the portal") and its transformation signals Elara's internal shift. Setup, development (middle transformation), and payoff (healed state) all present. The saucer's specific property (crack as portal) is irreplaceable and tied to the closure image. Strong integration: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" appears as the setting's name, the misty regrets forming a lattice, and Elara's process of facing her ghosts. It shapes the stakes (she must offer "true contrition") and the ending restates it: "Her repentance was complete, unbound from the clouds." The concept frames the emotional arc but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page—Elara's contrition is asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page decision. Setup, middle thematic presence, and ending resolution all present, but causal pressure is weaker than thematic resonance. Mid-band integration: 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is mentioned three times as a label ("to be willingly perplexed," "willingly perplexed acceptance," "The willingly perplexed state lifted") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables an action with cost. Elara does not make a choice *because* she is perplexed; the attribute is ornamental. Setup label, restated twice, no middle choice driven by it. Ornamental: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears as the required action ("to unfasten the seal guarding time's reservoir") and again when Elara "began to unfasten the knot holding her deepest regret." The action is central to the quest and directly precedes the saucer's healing. However, the mechanics are vague—what does unfastening entail beyond willpower?—and the action could be replaced with "release" or "break" without altering the plot. Setup (seal), middle use (knot), and ending consequence (healed saucer) all present, but swappability and summary treatment limit score. Functional across beats but not indispensable: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is seeded early ("her chosen method, the only map she trusted"), performed on the flat stone (she traces her hand and places the saucer within), and returns in the ending when she plans to trace her daughter's hand tomorrow. The method is specific, non-swappable, and its mechanics matter (the traced palm holds the saucer, creating the ritual frame). Setup, middle use that shapes the glade's response, and ending reprise with new application. Essential across beats: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is the setting for the entire quest. It is anchored early, richly described ("air here thinned into a choking beauty," "silvery wraiths," "eternal, dew-laden ferns"), and present through the ending when Elara descends at dawn. The glade provides the vault of crystallized seconds and the misty lattice door, but it does not impose a tactical constraint—Elara's passage is unopposed. Setup, continuous presence, and ending descent all present, but the environment does not alter her tactics or force a resource choice. Postcard-plus-symbolism, not micro-setting that pressures: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the birth of her daughter" frames the motivation (lost time post-birth) and the ending specifies "her daughter's first birthday" tomorrow. The timeframe provides emotional context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elara's quest proceeds at her own pace with no on-page clock. Setup mention and ending callback, but no middle pressure from time scarcity. Vague time that does not alter tactics: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find where lost time accumulates" is stated early, drives her climb to the glade, and is answered in the ending ("she knew where lost time accumulated: in the sacred pause between heartbeats"). The motivation is dramatized through her quest actions and conflicted with her fear of motherhood. Setup, middle pursuit, and ending resolution all present. The motivation is specific and tied to her role as new mother, with visible cost (leaving her sleeping child, facing her own ghosts). Strong integration: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is introduced as the glade's atmosphere ("so radiant it ached in the lungs," "a sublime pressure that made her eyes burn") and recurs four times, including in the final descent ("the choking beauty soften into a gentle embrace") and ending memory ("a sweet tightness in her throat"). The tone is coherent and modulates from painful to gentle. However, the repeated phrase becomes a label rather than an evolving sensory experience, and the final-paragraph summary flattens the charge. Setup, middle intensity, and ending modulation present, but repetition as stock phrase limits impact. Mid-band: 5.7.</comment>
