<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is concrete and embodied ("fever broke," "hollowed-out and clear," "cold, heavy stone in her gut"). Her motivation to measure the weight of swallowed truth drives her ritual observations and drawing, creating a credible arc from guilt to "quieter, more durable sorrow." The shift from believing family history was dignified pursuit to discovering theft is earned through the portfolio smudges. Minor slip: the oracle metaphor ("fault-tolerant oracle, receiving data") leans diagnostic and slightly distanced in a few beats, but the final drawing choice forecloses passivity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (mountain weather station, post-fever, portfolio on desk) land within the first 120 words. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual weather recording interleaved with botanical illustration study, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's final drawing acknowledges the smudge pattern, naming the weight as "specific" and belonging to the past—a clear before/after in stance with conceptual cost (accepting inherited grief rather than carrying guilt). One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, and the closure image reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete sensory anchors: wind's "pushing anthem," anemometer cups, analog gauges, auroral light "wash of violet and rose," whiteout blizzard cycles. The station's literal margin-of-the-world position mirrors Elara's strategy of occupying edges. The portfolio, desk, bunk, and eastern window track cleanly across beats. The smudged botanical illustration (saxifrage painting) charges the final drawing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate test for Q3: a recurring object constrains the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: measure the weight of the swallowed truth (family legacy as theft vs. stolen-from). The stake is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the day's ritual, portfolio study, and smudge discovery. One meaningful tightening: recognizing the great-grandmother as victim, not thief, shifts the weight from "leaden guilt" to "durable sorrow." The final drawing forecloses passive observation—Elara names the weight and leaves it in the past—with visible cost (accepting grief, rejecting guilt). Agency is clear and the price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth as inherited weight, legacy occupying margins) emerges from the smudged illustrations, weather volatility, and Elara's drawing without overt statement. The final image—smudging her own saxifrage stem—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acknowledgment rather than correction. The flaws-as-confession reading reweights all prior botanical particulars. No thematic echo or moralizing in the ending. Minor slip: "swaying certainties" and "fault-tolerant oracle" occasionally edge toward prompt-label territory, but the image-work and final drawing ground the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: Elara filters setting through measurement ("wind speeds, barometric pressure") and botanical detail. The oracle/data metaphor repeats across several beats, creating a mild template cadence that doesn't quite rise to voice-particular rhythm. Diction remains consistent and embodied ("hollowed-out," "floor seemed to tilt"). The final drawing beat modulates appropriately. No dialogue present; interior voice is clean but the oracle frame slightly mechanizes a few transitions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences multitask (e.g., "auroral sorrow" blends setting, tone, emotional state). Clarity and propulsion are strong through the ritual beats. Minor loop: "swaying certainties" appears three times (paragraph 1, 3, 5) with only slight variation in vehicle, edging toward synonym churn. The metaphor stack in paragraph one ("fault-tolerant oracle," "cold, heavy stone," "obsolete station perched on a stone tooth") is dense but coherent. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. A single paraphrase slip in the "occupying margins" phrasing (paragraphs 1 and 4) but not severe enough to obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (inherited academic theft revealed through flawed botanical art) is specific and non-obvious. The smudge-as-confession reading transforms a familiar "family secret" frame into something particular. The weather station literalizes "margins" without heavy-handedness. Risk: interiority leans abstract in places (oracle, swaying certainties), but the final drawing grounds the concept in embodied action. Proximity check clear; no close echoes of famous passages. The ending resists summary and leaves the weight "specific" and "belong[ing] to the past" rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character appears in opening ("fault-tolerant oracle") and drives the ritual observation beats and final drawing. The oracle frame is more metaphor than decision-making trait; Elara's choices (record weather, study portfolio, draw saxifrage) shape the arc, but "oracle" itself is passive. Present in closure (synthesizing "final data point") but the deciding action is the drawing, not oracle-logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Botanical illustration (saxifrage) appears in paragraph 2, returns in paragraph 4 ("each painting bore a subtle flaw"), and is causally active in paragraph 5 (smudge = confession) and the final drawing beat. The smudge reweights from error to legacy marker, constraining Elara's final choice to acknowledge rather than correct. High beat involvement, closure linkage strong, irreplaceable (the flaw pattern drives the turn).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Core concept ("swaying certainties") is named in paragraph 1, mirrored in weather volatility (paragraph 4), and resolved in the final paragraph ("certainties would always sway"). It shapes Elara's internal stance but not on-page tactics; the smudge discovery is the active driver. Present early and at closure, but functions more as thematic echo than decision constraint. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Attribute ("peripherally aware") appears once in paragraph 2 ("peripherally aware of every ache") as bodily description. No causal role; swappable with "dimly aware" or "half-conscious of." Label-only, no cost tied to this trait. Late first appearance and ornamental use cap at 4.6; functional mention in one beat keeps it above 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Action (smudge) appears as object feature (paragraph 2: "deliberate smudge of green pigment"), is recognized as pattern (paragraph 4: "each painting bore a subtle flaw"), reinterpreted (paragraph 5: "smudge was not an error, but a confession"), and enacted by Elara (final paragraph: "let her pencil point smudge the line"). The smudge drives the major turn (great-grandmother as victim) and the closure act. Early signal, two distinct beats, closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method ("by occupying margins") is signaled in paragraph 1 ("occupying margins herself"), mirrored in the station's literal margin position, and enacted in the final drawing (drawing in the ledger's margin). The method shapes the resolution choice but not mid-scene tactics. Lyric setup and closure reprise with cost (acknowledging rather than correcting) lifts it into the 6s. Present early and at closure; causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mountain weather station anchors all beats: wind/anemometer, analog gauges, eastern window, whiteout blizzard. The station's margin-of-the-world position mirrors theme and constrains Elara's isolation, making the portfolio the only companion. The station supplies the ledger for the final drawing. Early signal, sustained presence, closure participation (ledger margin), and micro-setting (desk, gauges) alters mood and choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after fever breaks") anchors paragraph 1 ("just before dawn") and brackets the piece (one day: dawn → "day" → "next auroral light"). Time is tracked loosely ("spent the day," "lulls") but doesn't create tactical pressure. The fever-break marks clarity but doesn't function as a ticking clock. Present early, stable across beats, mild closure echo ("deepening into morning"), but no urgency tied to elapsed hours.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is stated in paragraph 1 ("she had come here...to find its weight"), dramatized through ritual recording and portfolio study (paragraphs 3–4), and resolved in the final synthesis ("weight of the truth was not hers to carry, but to name"). The desire drives all choices and the final drawing forecloses guilt with visible cost. Early signal, sustained across beats, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone ("auroral sorrow") is named in paragraph 2 ("thin, auroral sorrow"), sustained through "perpetual twilight," "brutal winds," and "quieter, more durable sorrow" (paragraph 5), and charges the final image ("auroral sorrow outside was deepening into morning"). Coherent across turns, modulates with pressure (fever break → clarity → grief transmuted), and the color palette (violet, rose) recurs. Strong closure charge; one micro slip: "auroral sorrow" is stated twice, edging label-like, but the image-work supports it.</comment>
