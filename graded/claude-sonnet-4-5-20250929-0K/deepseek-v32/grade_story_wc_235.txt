<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—distill temporal chaos into narrative—and her method (jealousy of past selves) is distinctive. Interiority leans heavily on reflection and philosophical summary rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene; the emotional arc moves from confusion to peace through writing, but pivotal moments (seeing the grave, the act of chronicling) lack visceral, contradictory impulses. The final integration feels asserted ("she no longer felt chronologically confused") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Backstory dominates without micro-choices that alter present options until the writing scene, which depresses immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and reflections to reweight Elara's relationship to her temporal experience. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—she embraces nonlinearity and achieves peace—but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than visceral or on-page forfeiture. The tightening is a single deepening (jealousy transforms into kinship) that lands late and is told rather than dramatized. No causality breaks, but the closure unit feels more thematic assertion than decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, and valley meadow are vivid and purposeful. The cabin's dust and dried herbs anchor sensory specificity, and the scroll's organic texture contrasts the digital world Elara avoids, reinforcing character and theme. Spatial choreography (porch, table, door, shelf) tracks cleanly. The scroll and cabin setting constrain and enable the chronicling act, charging the final image when she places the completed scroll among others. Setting functions as micro-crucible for the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: distill temporal chaos into coherent narrative to restore agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when jealousy transforms into kinship, narrowing emotional options. However, the tightening is contemplative and summarized rather than tested through on-page choice with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a concrete trade-off or forfeiture; Elara's peace arrives through reflection and writing, not a decision that forecloses a live path. The grave and soaring motifs accumulate texture but do not escalate causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—temporal dislocation, mortality, and narrative agency—emerges organically from events and images. The birch bark scroll, soaring dreams, and grave in the meadow anchor subtext without overt statement. "Jaded wonder" charges the prose at moments ("awe tempered by the knowledge of an end"), and the final image (scroll on shelf, peace) offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Weakness: "feral nostalgia" and "chronologically confused" are stated as concepts rather than fully dramatized through constraint, and the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("her story was hers to shape").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (dream chronicler, analog preference, temporal dislocation) is consistent. Diction matches her reflective stance, though some phrases ("jaded wonder tinted her prose," "feral nostalgia") feel more essayistic than voice-particular. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance remains close but abstract during long reflective stretches, dulling immediacy. Voice modulates minimally under pressure; the climactic writing scene maintains the same meditative register rather than sharpening or fragmenting. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally strong; no major loops or causal obscurity. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with "She" or "The," creating mild template cadence. Overwriting check: figurative language ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chronologically confused," "distill chaos into narrative") recurs frequently, sometimes as assertion rather than image, but does not obscure closure. Information density is moderate; many lines advance theme or motif but fewer advance plot pressure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor register drift: "temporal rupture," "kinship" edge toward clinical diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dream chronicler, temporal confusion, and birch bark chronicle is specific and committed. "Feral nostalgia" and "getting jealous of past selves" offer fresh angles on temporal dislocation. However, the core arc—protagonist confronts mortality, processes grief through art, achieves peace—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The grave vision and soaring motif feel evocative but not structurally indispensable; swapping them for similar epiphany triggers would leave the emotional arc intact. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: template transformation is partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler shapes Elara's perception and tool choice (birch bark, analog preference) and her response to temporal chaos. The attribute is present throughout and informs the climactic writing act. However, her choices within the narrative—sitting, writing, walking outside, placing the scroll—are contemplative rather than decision-driven turns. The role observes and processes more than it constrains tactics or alters options under pressure. Two gates met (setup, payoff in writing scene); middle development is introspection rather than choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll is introduced early (sixth paragraph), used in the central writing scene (multiple beats: pen hovers, she writes, fills it, rolls it), and placed on the shelf at closure with reweighted meaning (testament to integration). The scroll's organic texture contrasts the digital world and anchors her chronicling method. Three gates met. It constrains her method (analog, tactile) and charges the final image. Strong specificity and irreplaceability; the exact material matters. Missing higher band: no visible cost tied uniquely to the scroll itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is named twice ("a savage longing," "became a source of strength") and described thematically. It shapes her emotional texture but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The concept remains an interpretive layer rather than a tactical pressure. Setup gate met (early mention); middle and closure participation are thematic echo rather than causal involvement. Swappable with "wild grief" or similar phrases without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is named early ("Her perception was chronologically confused") and invoked throughout (cascade of scenes, nonlinear timeline). It provides texture and stakes (chaos to distill) but does not constrain a concrete choice with visible cost. The trait is summarized more than dramatized; we are told she sees past/future selves but not shown a specific tactical tradeoff forced by the confusion. Two gates: setup and thematic payoff when she "no longer felt chronologically confused." Middle development is reflective rather than action-constraining.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Soaring appears in dreams, as remembered sensation, as imaginative act at the door, and as metaphor ("ascent to perspective"). It recurs across beats and charges the final lines. However, it remains largely metaphorical and mnemonic; no major turn traces causally to the act of soaring itself. The action is evocative and supports theme but is swappable with other transcendent imagery (flying, floating) without breaking story logic. Three gates met; causal pressure is moderate; specificity is poetic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Getting jealous of past selves is named explicitly and mechanics described: she envies the pre-grave and post-acceptance Elara. The method is signaled early (mid-story), shapes her emotional progression, and transforms into kinship at closure. It drives the key deepening (jealousy → empathy → integration). Three gates met. The method is more psychological process than tactical constraint, and the transformation is told rather than dramatized through choice with visible cost. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin anchors setting throughout: perched on sheer drop, dust and herbs, rough-hewn table, shelf, door, porch. It provides the space for chronicling and the final act of shelving the scroll. The cabin is "more than a retreat; it was a laboratory for temporal understanding." Three gates met. It supplies resources (scroll, solitude) and charges the ending image but does not pressure choices or impose tactical constraint; Elara could perform the same arc in another quiet space. Micro-setting credit for the scroll and table; closure participation is spatial rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after seeing your own grave" is setup in the second paragraph and recurs as memory. The grave vision provides the inciting disruption and is reweighted at closure ("no longer a terror but a marker in a story still being written"). Two gates: setup and closure participation. However, the temporal after-ness does not tighten decisions or tactics; the narrative present is contemplative and unclocked. The grave is pivotal thematically but does not function as a temporal constraint shaping moment-to-moment moves. Missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to distill chaos into narrative is named explicitly, drives the central writing scene, and is fulfilled at closure when the chronicle is complete. The desire is dramatized through the act of writing and the transformation from "desperate need" to "purposeful act." Three gates met. Friction is present (words refuse to come, images flash, chaos resists order) and the final lines confirm fulfillment ("chaos distilled into a narrative"). Solid causal pressure; the motivation shapes tactics (focus on soaring, furious writing). Cost is conceptual (acceptance of mortality) rather than visceral forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is named explicitly ("jaded wonder tinted her prose," "a testament to jaded wonder") and described as "awe tempered by the knowledge of an end." The tone is coherent through turns: beauty mixed with cynicism, feral nostalgia, memories that "tasted of ash." It modulates with pressure (from dizzy confusion to profound peace) and charges the final image (peace, acceptance, authorship). Three gates met. However, the tone is asserted more than enacted in sentence rhythm and image; the prose remains steady and meditative rather than shifting cadence to embody wonder or jadedness under stress. Strong thematic integration; moderate stylistic embodiment.</comment>
