<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is present and voice-consistent—"wistfully pragmatic acceptance," "quiet, stubborn" motivation—but her choices lack genuine internal friction. The mirror-array project unfolds with steady competence; no on-page moment shows her weighing cost, doubt, or competing impulses. Hal's lockmaster role is functional but thin; he hands over the tool without pressure or relational stakes. The embodied emotion is selective: "protected vulnerability" anchors her movement, yet the climactic alignment reads as execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is present: the final array transforms darkness into "soft patina," reweighting the premise with visible consequence—a Resonant Reconfiguration. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each mirror installation builds density toward the fullest-moon payoff. Orientation is clean by ~40 words (fire escape, harbor, Aris). One meaningful tightening occurs when she "aligned the master mirror" and pushes, crystallizing the pattern. Cost is partly implied—"fleeting garden"—but the story never shows what Aris gives up or risks to complete the work, leaving the felt price oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The harbor's "luminous… silver-black plate," fire escape's "skeletal stairs," and Hal's shed "oil and hot metal" anchor space and sensory detail through POV filter. The bitting gauge functions as micro-setting: its "precise, miniature mountain range" constrains her design. Spatial choreography is coherent across descent, shed visit, and return. The final array's light "traveled… leapt… fractured" uses environment to charge the ending image. One slight: the alleys are "dark, forgotten" but remain abstract until the light reveals chalk, moss, cat—late specificity that would lift higher if seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to reflect light into dark corners"—is clear from paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: the alignment and push that triggers the light-flow. Agency is present but entirely competent; Aris faces no reversal, resistance, or tactical adjustment. The phrase "everything seeks light" is thematic rather than a live conflict test. The ending reconfigures the visual field with consequence, yet no on-page moment shows Aris risking failure, choosing between competing goods, or foreclosing an alternate path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the rose's lesson, mirrors as keys, light "not forced… simply unlocked." "Protected vulnerability" and "wistfully pragmatic" cohere across action and tone. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "silent dialogue between light and dark," reweighting the premise without moralizing. One slip: "a wistfully pragmatic miracle" in the final paragraph edges close to stating the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it, and "the city… dreamed a little brighter" tilts sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: "wistfully pragmatic," selective focus on harbor glow and shadow corners, lyric compression ("slow river of cold light awoke"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Hal's single line of dialogue—"It shapes the key to the city's old heart"—feels elevated for grumbled speech but is brief. Diction under pressure is controlled: "cut, polish, set, adjust" uses rhythm to embody work. One pattern: recurrent "-ing" openers ("Using," "dipping," "revealing") and template stems in middle paragraphs create mild cadence monotony without harming clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the mirror-craft paragraph. Figurative language is dense—"luminous harbor," "quivering hush," "river of cold light," "tributaries," "patina"—and mostly coherent, but "clotted with shadows" and "crept into corners" edge purple in a single beat. Three template openers stack: "She descended… She would instill… She worked…" Late third contains "slow river… leapt… fractured… flowed… pooled… crept," a metaphor chain that blurs vehicle (water/light) without dramatizing the shift. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the climax risks opacity. One typo: none noted.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—fire escape gardener + lockmaster's tool repurposed as mirror-array pivot—is specific and non-obvious. The ending's "silent dialogue between light and dark" reframes premise with originality. Risk is present: lyric compression and extended metaphor ("oars in water" as work rhythm) heighten without obscuring closure. One friction: the core emotional arc—hope cultivator continues to cultivate—does not transform in hindsight; the rose-to-mirrors shift is elegant but lateral rather than revelatory of character contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aris frames expectation (setup), executes the mirror plan (middle beats), and conducts the final alignment (closure). Her choices—descend, craft, install, align—advance each beat causally. No moment shows her weighing competing tactics or facing obstacle-driven adjustment; she enacts competence. Swappability is low (role is specific), but agency without friction caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bitting gauge appears in Hal's shed (setup ~30% mark), is "used… as a template" for mirrors (middle development), and is "set at its pivotal joint" in the final alignment (closure). Two distinct uses across beats. The tool's unique property—mapping depths—enables the mirror design. Late first appearance (~30%) and the fact that a generic "template" could replace it with minor edits (the depth-mapping specificity is not causally required on the page) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears twice: after the petal falls and again at the ending ("returned, but now… awe"). It frames atmosphere but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Aris never weighs silence versus sound, nor does the hush shape her mirror-array design. The reprise reweights tone without causal pressure, a lyric touch that lifts the score slightly above ornamental but remains swappable with any ambient marker.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is named in paragraph one, embodied in "step-by-step clarity… core… pure longing," and echoed in the ending's "wistfully pragmatic miracle." The trait colors her approach—pragmatic execution, wistful goal—but no on-page moment shows the pairing force a trade-off or foreclose an impractical alternative. The final label-echo in the penultimate paragraph lowers integration; removal would not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Instill" is her plan ("She would instill it"), enacted through mirror installation, and fulfilled in the ending ("had instilled a silent dialogue"). The action drives the middle beats and articulates closure. One friction: "instill" is abstract; the concrete work is "craft… install… aligned," making "instill" a thematic umbrella rather than an irreplaceable tactic. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift the score; swappability with "create" or "establish" prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rhythm of oars in water" is signaled twice: Hal's clink (setup foreshadowing) and Aris's work cadence ("cut, polish, set, adjust… steady, dipping, forward-pressing motion"). The rhythm embodies her method and is reprised in the ending sentence. No on-page moment shows the rhythm constrain or enable a tactic under pressure; it is descriptive rather than causal. Early seed and charged reprise support lyric resonance, preventing lower band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The harbor is present from paragraph one, supplies the moonlight resource ("generous moonlight bouncing off"), and charges the final array ("traveled from the harbor's luminous face"). It enables the entire mirror design. The harbor does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adjustment; it is a stable resource rather than pressure. Early setup, middle function, and closure participation across all three gates lift the score. Swappability with any reflective body of water under moonlight caps higher band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rosebush petal falls in the opening, establishing "after" as the timeframe and teaching "the season for blooms was done." The lesson seeds the mirror-shift. The timeframe does not tighten decisions; no clock pressures Aris. "Night after night" and "the night the moon was fullest" mark progression but impose no urgency. Early signal and thematic payoff ("each beam a silent petal of light") provide lyric resonance without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is named in paragraph one, dramatized in the mirror-array design (middle beats: "calibrated to catch… and redirect"), and fulfilled in the ending's light pooling into "corners clotted with shadows." The motivation drives every beat and closure. One friction: the desire faces no on-page friction or competing want; Aris enacts it with steady competence, lowering the felt cost. High causal involvement and closure linkage support the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once ("embodying a state of protected vulnerability—open to the night, yet shielded by purpose") and reprised obliquely in the ending ("darkness felt not chased away, but finally seen, its vulnerability protected"). The tone coheres through the piece—gentle attention, cautious openness—and modulates at the climax ("profound, quiet solidarity"). No moment shows the tone tested or its duality force a choice. Lyric reprise and coherence across turns lift the score; lack of constraint caps higher band.</comment>
