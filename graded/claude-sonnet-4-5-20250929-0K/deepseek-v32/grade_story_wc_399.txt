<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve wisdom is stated early and drives the ritual sequence, but his interiority remains abstract—"felt a kinship with its transparent nature" and "found his own truth" are generic epiphanies rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The half-mask is introduced as symbolic duality but never constrains a choice or creates embodied friction. No meaningful internal conflict emerges; he executes a task smoothly without struggle, blind spots, or visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story signals its accumulative/textural lens early (murmuring pavilion, echo preservation, ritual sequencing) and anchors who/where by the opening lines. However, closure reads as completion of a pre-set task rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration: the parapet hums, clearings dissolve, Elian removes his mask and reflects on having "found his own truth"—a summary that asserts transformation without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence makes the cost legible at the ending beat. Per the Orientation Test waiver, the opening anchors are clear, so no penalty applies there, but the closure unit lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are described with purposeful detail (stone segments shifting "like a slow serpent," patches of still air). Spatial choreography remains clear across Elian's movement between clearings. The parapet constrains the final action—consecration requires it—and the pavilion's murmur bookends the piece, charging the frame. Sufficient for mid-band, but sensory selection does not shift with urgency (the ritual proceeds at steady calm), and no tool or body constraint alters a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the prophet's echo—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, no on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: Elian accesses clearings without resistance, gathers fragments without friction, and completes the consecration as planned. The process is delicate in assertion ("the process was delicate") but no live complication tests his commitment or forces a trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift or cost is required; the parapet's motion slowing is a micro-response, not a protagonist-driven turn. No visible price narrows his options or alters his tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the preservation ritual, the dual nature of the half-mask, and the contrast between fleeting truth and enduring echo. The parapet's "strange honesty" and the line "truths were fleeting" suggest reflection on impermanence and guardianship. However, the final paragraph moralizes lightly—"He had preserved what was essential, and in doing so, found his own truth"—approaching a thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate. The murmuring pavilion's approval is a convenient endorsement. No resonant non-literal answer reweights the premise; the ending states the accomplishment rather than charging it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Diction is consistent and leans toward elevated fantasy register ("whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "peripheral awareness"). However, perceptual signature is generic: Elian's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific bias or professional idiom beyond the ritual vocabulary. "Now, after the prophet arrives" (paragraph 33) is a tense inconsistency—should be "arrived"—breaking the past-tense frame. Psychic distance is uniform and does not modulate with pressure; the prose texture does not shift under the ritual's peak moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure shifts purposefully between action and reflection. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "The wisdom was not in words but in sensations" and "The wisdom echoed not as sound but as light" repeat the restatement pattern. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "Elian entered... Elian moved... Elian raised... Elian moved... Elian spoke..." (five consecutive stems across seven lines). Stock metaphor: "like collecting dew from grass." Register drift: "transparent nature" and "dual nature" lean abstract-philosophical mid-scene. Per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack, template cadence across multiple sentences triggers −0.4 to −0.6; combined with paraphrase loops, baseline −0.8 in Q7. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly, so the cap at 8.7 for final-third artifacts does not apply, but they dull momentum in the middle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The fantasy-ritual frame (prophet → echo → preservation) is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity. "Peripheral awareness," "conjured clearings," and "kinetic parapet" are inventive labels, but the plot mechanics—access temporary spaces, gather fragments, consecrate object—follow a standard quest-task template. The half-mask as symbolic duality is signaled but never tested. The ending—task completed, truth found, pavilion approves—is tidy and safe. Per the Derivative Premise Guardrail, the core premise closely matches ritual-preservation templates without fresh synthesis; apply −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (walking lines, entering clearings, placing light on the parapet, speaking dedication) drive the sequence. He appears in the setup (paragraph 2), middle beats (accessing clearings, gathering fragments), and ending (consecration complete, mask removed). However, his choices are procedural; no decision alters tactics or imposes a tradeoff. The gate model shows all three gates (setup, development, payoff) present, eligible for ≥6.1, but causal pressure is minimal—he executes a known ritual without friction. Swappability: another ritualist could perform the same steps. Additive guidance: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but no visible cost tied to his person (−0.5 ornamental, −0.6 swappability). Net ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is introduced early (paragraph 5: "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes"), returns in the middle (paragraph 15: "see the kinetic parapet, its stone segments shifting"), and is central to the ending (paragraphs 24–25: parapet absorbs light, motion slows; paragraph 35: "kinetic parapet would guard it, moving eternally"). Three distinct beats; closure linkage strong. However, the parapet's kinetic property does not constrain a choice—it receives the consecration passively. Its motion stopping is a response, not a cost Elian navigates. Additive guidance: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2; subtractive: ornamental physicality −0.5, no causal pressure −0.6. Net ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are introduced early (paragraph 7: "access conjured clearings"), actively used in the middle (paragraphs 12–14: sensing, entering, and moving between clearings), and dissolve at the ending (paragraph 36: "The conjured clearings dissolved one by one"). Three beats, setup/development/payoff present. The clearings enable Elian's method—without them, he cannot gather the fragments—and their mechanics (peripheral awareness) shape his tactics. However, they impose no friction or cost; each clearing appears when needed. Additive guidance: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables tactics) +1.0, closure linkage +0.9; subtractive: no on-page cost −0.4, late dissolve is summary −0.3. Net ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "strangely honest" is assigned to the parapet in paragraph 16 ("The parapet was strangely honest, revealing its purpose without guise or deception") and echoed near the ending (paragraph 39: "feeling the strange honesty of the moment settle upon him"). Two touches, but both are labels without action consequence. The parapet's honesty does not constrain Elian's choices or enable a tactic; it is thematic decoration. Additive guidance: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, lyric reprise +0.3; subtractive: label-only −0.6, swappability (could replace with "transparent" or "direct") −0.6. Cap 3.8 per swappability rule. Net ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "consecrate" is introduced early (paragraph 5: "consecrate the kinetic parapet"), pursued in the middle (paragraph 18: "preparing to consecrate," paragraph 19: "consecration required"), and completed at the ending (paragraph 27: "He consecrated the parapet," paragraph 34: "He completed the consecration"). Three beats; setup/development/payoff present. The action is the story's backbone—without consecration, the echo is not preserved. However, the act itself is described in summary ("spoke words of dedication," "binding it to the purpose") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Additive guidance: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4; subtractive: summary-only −0.8, no visible tradeoff or friction during the act −0.5. Net ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness is introduced early (paragraph 8: "peripheral awareness, a skill Elian had mastered"), used in the middle (paragraph 11: "focused on the edges of his vision," paragraph 12: "Through peripheral awareness, he sensed the first clearing"), and mentioned again at the ending sequence (paragraph 20: "each step guided by his peripheral awareness"). Three beats; the method enables his access to clearings, shaping his tactics. However, it functions as an on/off switch with no friction—he "mastered" it, so no cost or constraint arises. Additive guidance: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables tactics) +1.0; subtractive: no cost or constraint −0.6, swappability (could replace with "focused will") −0.5. Net ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is introduced in the opening line, frames the ritual (paragraph 10: "The pavilion murmured with the memories"), and bookends the ending (paragraph 37: "Elian stepped back into the murmuring pavilion," paragraph 40: "The pavilion murmured its approval"). Three touches; setup/development/payoff present. The pavilion supplies the echo and frames the ritual space, but it does not constrain Elian's choices or alter his tactics—it is an ambient container. Additive guidance: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (final frame) +0.8; subtractive: no choice constraint −0.7, static atmosphere −0.5. Net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the prophet arrives" is established in the opening paragraph ("The prophet had come and gone") and restated in paragraph 33 ("Now, after the prophet arrives"). Two touches, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elian proceeds at a measured pace with no clock pressure. The phrase in paragraph 33 contains a tense error ("arrives" should be "arrived"), breaking coherence. Additive guidance: early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3; subtractive: no urgency or clock −0.8, tense inconsistency −0.4, summary-only −0.4. Cap 4.6 per missing-development gate (no middle tightening). Net ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" is established early (paragraph 3: "He had stayed after the prophet's departure to preserve the echo of wisdom"), pursued in the middle (paragraph 19: "consecration required... the echo to be channeled," paragraph 29: "ensure those truths endured"), and fulfilled at the ending (paragraph 37: "the echo of wisdom was safe"). Three beats; setup/development/payoff present. The motivation drives every action. However, it is never conflicted—no competing want or fear tests Elian's commitment. Additive guidance: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9; subtractive: no friction or cost −0.8, told-only desire −0.5. Net ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone "whisperfield calm" is named in the opening paragraph and sustained through the piece with calm, measured prose and low-intensity verbs ("murmuring," "quiet," "gentle glow," "respectful halt"). It modulates slightly at the consecration (paragraph 27: "words of dedication, his voice a whisper") and returns at the ending (paragraph 37: "the whisperfield calm deepening around him"). Three touches; setup/development/payoff present. The tone is coherent but static—no pressure-driven shift or cadence break reweights the stake. Additive guidance: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.6; subtractive: static mood −0.6, no modulation under pressure −0.5. Net ~5.7.</comment>
