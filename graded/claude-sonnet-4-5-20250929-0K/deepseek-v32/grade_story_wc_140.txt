<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior landscape is distinctive—filtering through sensation rather than identity. The poison-tea realization shows contradictory impulses crystallizing into a painful truth with visible cost. However, the character remains largely observational across most of the text; micro-choices that alter tactics on the page are sparse until the final beat. The "layering" method is articulated but not dramatized as struggle or error that compounds before breakthrough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory fragments and overheard stories until the wolfsbane label triggers a density break that reweights the protagonist's quest. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist crystallizes a shard of truth and accepts the texture of loss as his only identity, with the conceptual cost (namelessness accepted, file stamped and misfiled) legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (the aconite connection) tightens prior accumulation into a charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth functions as both refuge and metaphor, shaping the protagonist's movements and perceptual method. Sensory details—greasy water, rust chill, spice leaks—are filtered through his particular mode of attention. The poison label (object-as-micro-setting) recurs with reweighted meaning and constrains the final realization. Spatial choreography (narrow canyon, chosen container) remains coherent. The tidal rhythm and steel canyon supply a recurring constraint that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: discover the texture of erased memories. The wolfsbane discovery is a meaningful tightening that narrows options from abstract layering to a specific, painful origin. The watchman's story deepens pressure by connecting aconite to the label. Agency at closure is attention and acceptance—pressing the label to the wall and letting the shard crystallize—which forecloses the search for a name with visible cost (identity gone, file misfiled). Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices; however, the protagonist's earlier attempts remain described rather than dramatized with visible friction or failed tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (erased histories, the texture of loss, bureaucratic erasure as literal unmade identity) emerges organically from the container metaphor and the poison-label particulars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: he will never know his name, but he has discovered the rough pulp, smooth lie, and terrifying softness that unmade him. No overt moralizing; the final image reweights prior material. The recurring motif (label, layering, container-as-mind) constrains the final choice and charges closure without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (filtering by sensation, grain, texture) is distinct and consistent. Diction—"spectral figure," "bureaucratic phantom," "the rough pulp of the poison label"—maintains a lyric register that suits the protagonist's dislocated state. The watchman's dialogue ("Just a little for the pain," "Aconite, they called it") carries distinct idiom. No head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully at the climax ("devastating, beautiful softness"). One minor note: "filters reality differently" in the opening paragraph edges toward thesis statement; the effect is largely mitigated by subsequent embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening and closing beats. The wolfsbane–aconite connection propels the climax cleanly. However, the middle section contains mild paraphrase loops: "He layered the story… He layered the tale…" repeats structure without added pressure. "He would listen, then retreat… he would attempt to layer" is scaffolding that could be cut. The phrase "layer these echoes onto the blank slate of himself" is slightly abstract. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but the mid-section drag applies a modest penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic error, poison-induced amnesia, and container-labyrinth metaphor is specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's quest for "texture" rather than linear history is a fresh inflection. However, the amnesiac-searching-for-identity frame and the wise-wanderer-collecting-stories premise are familiar; transformation occurs through the poison label's specificity and the final acceptance of namelessness. The piece commits to its premise and follows through with conceptual integrity. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The survivor's choices—carrying the label, noticing sickness stories, pressing the label to the wall at closure—create the final turn. However, much of the text is observational; the decision to "layer" is articulated but not dramatized as a series of failed attempts with visible cost until the climax. Present in setup, development (collecting stories), and payoff (crystallization), meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity is high at closure. Late first dramatized choice and limited middle-beat agency prevent entry to the 7.0+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poison label is discovered mid-narrative, carried as a "tangible whisper," and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when pressed to the wall. It appears in three distinct beats: discovery, the aconite connection, and the final layering. The label's skull-and-crossbones symbol and "Wolfsbane" word constrain the protagonist's realization and charge the ending image. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; the exact artifact (faded, sodden, legible) is indispensable to the closure effect. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the protagonist's method (collecting overheard stories of departures, vanishings) and the stakes (his own bureaucratic erasure). The concept constrains tactics: he layers fragments hoping for resonance. At closure, the death certificate error and purged records are named as the final seal, and the conceptual cost (identity misfiled, never recoverable) is undeniable. Present in setup, development, and payoff. The concept is thematic and causal, altering options and charging the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attribute—filtering reality through sensation (chill of rust, scent of spices, hollow echo)—is demonstrated in the opening and constrains his method throughout. It enables his noticing of the poison label and the watchman's story. At closure, the protagonist synthesizes taste, scent, voice, and texture into the crystallized shard. The trait is embodied in perception across multiple beats and shapes the final layering with visible cost (he will never know his name, but he has the texture). Present in setup, development, and payoff; strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The layering action is the protagonist's core method, articulated in the opening ("layer them, one over another") and repeated in the middle ("He layered the story… He layered the tale…"). At closure, the layering "did not slide away. It crystallized"—the action redefines options and delivers the resolution. Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives at least two beats. Specificity is high at closure. The action is not easily swappable; removing it would break the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—collecting fragments of overheard stories—is signaled in the opening and demonstrated in the watchman scene. The protagonist listens, retreats, and layers; the watchman's aconite story is the key fragment that triggers the climax. Present in setup (articulated as purpose), development (watchman scene), and payoff (the aconite connection crystallizes the final layering). The method shapes attempts and constrains the resolution. Mechanics are visible; the method is irreplaceable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is both physical refuge and metaphor for the protagonist's mind. The narrow canyon between cubes is where he finds the poison label; the chosen container is where he retreats to layer stories. The setting's tidal rhythm and steel surfaces supply sensory constraints. At closure, "the labyrinth of containers was not just his refuge; it was the perfect metaphor"—the setting charges the final image. Present in setup, development, and payoff; constrains choices and supplies resources. Micro-setting (body, label, container wall) also functions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tidal rhythm is invoked in the opening ("slow inhalation and exhalation," "rhythmic pull," "low-tide afternoon") and frames the protagonist's world. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the protagonist's quest is patient accumulation without a live clock. The tides are atmospheric but do not alter tactics or constrain the climax. Present in setup and as ambient texture, but missing middle development and closure participation. Functional but replaceable; lyric resonance is mild.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to discover the texture of memories is articulated as "his only compulsion" and dramatized through the protagonist's collecting, layering, and final acceptance. Friction appears between the want (identity, linear history) and the cost (he will never know his name). At closure, the motivation is fulfilled obliquely: he has the texture, not the name. Present in setup, development (watchman scene), and payoff. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the motivation drives at least two beats and is indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone—unnamed, dislocated, spectral—is established in the opening ("nameless one," "bureaucratic phantom," "raw, unrecorded presence") and modulates with pressure at the climax ("devastating, beautiful softness"). The tone remains coherent through turns and charges the final image: "He would never know his name… a file stamped and misfiled." Present in setup, development, and payoff; the tone shapes perception and voice across beats. Strong coherence and closure linkage, though the tone is more atmospheric than causally constraining.</comment>
