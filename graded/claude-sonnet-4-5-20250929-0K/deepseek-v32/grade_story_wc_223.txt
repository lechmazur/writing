<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is assigned multiple contradictory labels—"crisis actor," "real crisis survivor," "benevolently ruthless," "historian of small gestures"—but these remain decorative rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene. Her walking patterns and archive mission are asserted repeatedly without embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile and departure feel like summary rather than earned transformation, and no visible path is foreclosed. Internal contradiction never acts simultaneously; traits toggle rather than collide.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece offers no legible closure unit: Elara departs with the chessboard, having "set free" whispers, but no before/after option-state is visible—she begins as historian and ends as historian with no dramatized cost or foreclosed path. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout (lyric accumulation? symbolic quest?), never cohering into a dominant stake by midpoint. Orientation is delayed and vague: "during the interregnum" and "whispering gallery" anchor time and place, but who Elara is and what concrete problem she faces remain abstract until well past the opening third. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, and lens ambiguity at closure caps Q2 at 7.2; the absent closure effect itself drives the low score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is named and described with acoustic properties and a chessboard, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—Elara walks patterns freely without spatial cost. The "nomadic penumbra" drifts and projects shadows, yet these movements are decorative; no door is locked, no path blocked. Micro-setting (the chessboard, the marble floor) is handled but does not charge the final image with concrete pressure. Orientation debt per Q2 caps Q3 at 7.0, and the decorative use justifies the mid-band score within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"unbind the archive" or "liberate stories"—is asserted early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Elara walks, spells words, and succeeds without visible friction or trade-off. No reversal narrows options: the penumbra cooperates, the gallery responds, the pawns "echo" on command. Agency is gestural (walking patterns) rather than decision-based, and the resolution (departing with the chessboard) costs nothing on the page. One tightening or deepening is absent; pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory, gesture, and historical preservation emerges through repeated assertions ("small gestures," "luminous absence") rather than dramatized particulars. The chessboard's missing pawns are explained as "the lost masses" in direct symbolic statement, and the final paragraph moralizes: "luminous absence...full of every whispered truth she had set free." No non-literal answer arises from scene pressure; instead, thematic labels ("unbind," "remember," "release") are spelled and then summarized. The "benevolently ruthless" trait is told, not shown through competing goods.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "she sensed," "she realized," "she understood" recur without character-specific texture. Diction occasionally elevates without motivation ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") and does not clearly belong to Elara's interior lexicon. Filter verbs ("sensing," "realizing") stack in peak beats without voice payoff. The walking-patterns mechanic is asserted but not rendered with tactile immediacy—no sweat, misstep, or bodily cost. No dialogue appears; internal voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "unbind"/"liberate," "small gestures" (×6), "luminous absence" (×4), "benevolently ruthless" (×3) recur without added pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]...," "The [noun]...," "During the interregnum..." in mechanical rotation. Figurative language ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. The final third continues loops ("luminous absence" ×2 in the last five lines), triggering the artifact cap that disallows 9+ globally and adds baseline −1.2 in Q7 for spread and closure-beat contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—walking patterns that spell words to unlock architectural memory—offers a fresh visual, but execution relies on familiar "lost knowledge" and "fallen regime" templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The interregnum setting and crisis-actor identity remain ornamental labels. Emotional arc (archivist mission → archivist departure) could swap names and places unchanged. No bold risk elevates stakes; the piece hedges with abstract language ("luminous absence") rather than committing to concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes walking choices, but these are execution of a pre-set mission rather than decisions that narrow options or create key turns. The "crisis actor/real survivor" label appears early but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost—it is decorative. She touches the chessboard and departs with it, but no stake hinges on her dual identity. Swappable with "archivist" or "curator" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chessboard appears early (setup), is touched mid-story (development beat), and carried at the end (closure participation). Its missing pawns are explained symbolically and "represented by her every step" in the final third, reweighting its meaning from loss to resilience. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure—Elara succeeds regardless—and the ending cameo is passive (carried as relic) rather than causally active. Two-beat involvement and lyric reprise earn mid-band, but swappability (any symbolic object of loss could serve) and lack of pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" is named early and drifts/projects shadows across multiple beats, but it functions as atmospheric accessory rather than stake-shaper. It "follows her" at the end, yet this does not alter her options or tactics on the page. The concept is ornamental: a wandering shadow that cooperates without cost. Removing it would not break logic or closure; generic "memory force" could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is asserted three times but never dramatized through competing-goods choices or visible tradeoffs. Elara "offers compassion...while coldly dismantling" is told, not shown; no scene depicts her refusing aid or prioritizing archive over person. Label-only mention without on-page cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unbind" is spelled early, recurs as command and theme, and anchors the mission throughout. However, it does not drive a turn—Elara begins unbinding and ends unbinding with no reversal. The action is synonymous with "release" and "liberate," making it swappable. Present across beats but does not redefine options; mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The walking-that-spells-words method is signaled in the first third, used in at least three beats (spelling "unbind," "remember," "release," "history," "peace"), and mentioned in the closure section ("her every step" represents pawns). However, its mechanics are asserted rather than shown to matter under pressure—no misstep, no fatigue, no cost to the walking itself. The method enables outcomes without constraint, trending functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The whispering gallery frames the entire piece (setup) and is present in the ending section (closure participation). Its acoustics "respond" and "amplify" mid-story (development beat), altering sensory texture. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a scarce resource—Elara walks freely, and the gallery cooperates. The setting is atmospheric rather than tactical. Three-gate presence and acoustic reprise earn low-mid band, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any resonant architecture) prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The interregnum is named early and repeated throughout, anchoring the story in a power vacuum. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock runs, no urgency escalates. The setting could be any post-collapse era with minor edits. Present and thematically consistent, but does not alter tactics or closure, capping at functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "become the historian of small gestures" is stated early and repeated across beats, driving Elara's archive mission and culminating in her embodiment of historian at closure. However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice—no gesture is prioritized over another with visible cost, no tension between documentation and intervention. Desire is told and consistent but not pressured, landing in functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears early and recurs four times, anchoring the piece's tone of memory-glow and loss. It charges the final image ("luminous absence glowed brighter") with thematic weight. However, the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure, no shift from absence to presence or vice versa. The phrase is poeticized but does not deepen through turns. Lyric reprise with closure presence earns functional-replaceable band; lack of tonal escalation prevents higher score.</comment>
