<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's singular motivation—to capture the runaway dream through sunrise photography—is concrete and drives all major choices. Interior texture is consistent and voice-specific, particularly in the cipher-realization beat. The grandmother memory materializes late but recontextualizes the longing with embodied cost (the severed connection). Minor weakness: the shift from "runaway dream as place" to "dream as presence/connection" relies more on revelation than prior contradiction, limiting internal conflict visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated attempts with the palette until the complete cipher materializes, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the dream was never a place but a severed presence. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: she paints the cipher onto stone, letting it fade rather than possessing it as an image. One meaningful tightening occurs when glyphs cohere into a map, then deepen into memory. Causality holds under the accumulative lens; the palette's escalating use directly enables the closure realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archipelago's "whispers," palette's translucent residue, and cliff vantage all shape tactics—Elara journeys to different islands seeking the perfect angle, and the final cliff location is dictated by the glyphs. The palette as micro-setting (tool) constrains her method and charges the final image when she mixes dew with light. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. Mild penalty: the "whispering" motif remains mostly atmospheric rather than concretely altering a mid-scene choice; it primes mood more than it narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under Accumulative lens: repeated sunrise sessions → glyphs emerge → map forms → complete cipher + memory materializes. Agency is present: Elara's final choice to paint rather than photograph forecloses possession in favor of inhabitation, a visible renunciation with felt cost ("the cipher already fading"). The tightening is meaningful but single-threaded; no secondary pressure or credible loss alters tactics mid-journey, keeping the band below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—what light can hold when words cannot—emerges organically from the grandmother's teaching, the palette practice, and the final act of painting the cipher onto stone. The runaway dream reweights from spatial goal to relational void, and the closure image (temporary symbols on rock) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: presence over possession. No explicit moralizing. The "luminous absence" phrase borders on abstraction but is anchored in the cipher and the severed love, giving it earned specificity. Minor slip: "woven into the hush, a permanent beginning in the light" nudges toward summary in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Elara's way of noticing privileges light, islands, and ephemeral patterns. Diction remains consistent ("spear of sun," "liquid fire," "spectral bands") without register drift. No dialogue. Under peak pressure (cliff sunrise), syntax compresses appropriately. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("she believed," "she knew"). Mild penalty: "preternaturally calm" and "solemn plate" introduce slight elevation in diction during the climax, nudging outside the established texture without breaking legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or stakes. Clear propulsion through the escalating sunrise sessions. Minor artifacts: "the act felt like a summons, a quiet prayer against the recurring tone of luminous absence" stacks metaphors without adding pressure; "luminous absence" recurs as a near-synonym for longing across multiple beats. Light paraphrase between "held the palette before her lens" and "angling it to catch" within one beat. No loops or scaffold severe enough to obscure closure. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density and synonym cycle in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core synthesis—photography as cipher-decoding via watercolor palette, childhood memory as the "lost place"—feels specific and non-obvious. The grandmother reveal transforms the quest from spatial to relational, earned in hindsight by the "presence/absence" framing. Risk: using light refraction to materialize glyphs is fresh within the frame. Minor deduction: the "odd-hour librarian" detail and library setting function mostly as atmospheric prelude without causal weight, trending toward checklist fulfillment. The final renunciation (painting vs. possessing) elevates originality by choosing ephemeral inhabitation over capture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the key final choice (paint rather than photograph). Setup clear. However, the "librarian" role itself does not constrain or enable any on-page choice—her shift ends at dawn, she locks the doors, but the library work is summary-only. The occupation could swap to any dusk-to-dawn role without altering causality. One decisive choice at closure prevents lower score, but the specific character trait (librarian) remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Watercolor palette is handled across at least four beats: carried in the bag, used to fracture dawn light (repeated mornings), held before the lens on the cliff, and finally employed to paint the cipher with dew. Early signal, causal pressure (enables the glyphs), and closure linkage (the final painting act). Irreplaceable: the palette's translucent residue is the mechanism that "paints with light." Visible cost: she uses it to create a fading image rather than a permanent capture, foregrounding ephemeral presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cipher of longing is signaled early ("leaving only a cipher of longing in her heart") and reappears as the visual glyphs that emerge through refracted light. It shapes stakes—Elara interprets the glyphs as a map—and directly enables the climax revelation (cipher = memory/connection). The cipher is not merely thematic; it alters on-page tactics (journey to the cliff, final painting). Closure linkage: painting the cipher onto stone is the culminating act. High irreplaceability; the story hinges on decoding this exact visual script.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is the method anchoring Elara's practice: she uses the palette's translucent residue to filter sunrise, producing glyphs across multiple beats. Setup clear, development present (repeated attempts), and closure participation (final cliff sunrise). The trait constrains tactics—she must await first light at specific vantages—and enables the cipher's emergence. Mild cap: the "paints with light" phrase is more descriptive label than a visible tradeoff on the page; the cost is time/journey, not a struggle intrinsic to the painting-with-light method itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears three times: her practice "to vitalize the intangible," glyphs "vitalizing the archipelago's whispers," and "to vitalize it fully" she paints rather than photographs. The term shapes the thematic vocabulary and the final choice (painting = full vitalization vs. capture). Closure linkage present. However, "vitalize" functions more as conceptual label than distinct action—removing it and substituting "manifest" or "give form to" would not break the plot. Mid-band for lyric-resonance reprise without mechanical irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled early ("turned to sunrise photography"), mechanically detailed (tripod, viewfinder, capturing images), and drives the escalation—each sunrise session yields a new glyph fragment. Shapes tactics: Elara must journey to islands at dawn, await first light, and position the palette. Closure participation: the final cliff sunrise produces the complete cipher. High irreplaceability: the story's logic depends on light-capture at sunrise to decode the cipher. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago is named early, provides the geography (multiple islands, final cliff), and supplies the "whispers" motif that recurs. Mild pressure: the glyphs point west to "the furthest and most silent isle," guiding Elara's final journey. Closure presence: the whispers "fell completely still" at the end. However, the archipelago's specificity is mostly atmospheric—any remote island cluster with cliffs would serve. The "whispers" could pressure more concretely if Elara had to interpret or resist them mid-scene. Mid-band for functional geography + thematic recurrence without irreplaceable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hush of improbable beginnings" appears twice: once in the opening paragraph and again at the climactic sail ("on a day when..."). The phrase sets tone and marks the final journey's temporality. Mild closure linkage: it reappears at the peak. However, "hush" is more mood descriptor than live clock—there is no ticking pressure or time constraint altering tactics. The timeframe is dawn/dusk cycle, which shapes when Elara works but does not tighten decisions within a scene. Lyric reprise earns mid-range score without mechanical time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation—to capture the runaway dream—is established early, drives all on-page actions (repeated sunrise sessions, island journeys, final cliff ascent), and transforms at closure when Elara realizes the dream is not a place but a severed connection. Friction present: the longing is "haunting," and the final choice to paint rather than possess embodies the cost of letting go. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong irreplaceability: removing this exact motivation collapses the story's arc. Minor cap: the motivation is told more than shown in internal conflict during the attempts; it drives behavior but does not visibly war with a competing want mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is named explicitly and echoed throughout: "luminous place," "luminous lines," "luminous absence... the space where that love had resided." Tone modulates appropriately—initial longing, intensifying at cipher emergence, quiet resolution at the end. The phrase charges the final image: Elara accepts absence as presence, and the cipher fades. Coherent through turns. Mild penalty: "luminous absence" risks abstraction and is named rather than purely evoked, but the pairing of light imagery with the grandmother memory grounds it. Strong thematic resonance with closure linkage elevates into the 7+ band.</comment>
