<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to understand the mathematics of emotion is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The "borrowed personalities" attribute remains label-only; we're told he fragments but never see competing desires act simultaneously during a press operation. The widow's grief and inventor's joy are experienced as sequential downloads rather than layered internal conflict. The final realization—that emotion should be appreciated, not mastered—arrives as summary rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches a pattern of empathy-borrowing that deepens until the unsigned letter floods Aris with multiple voices, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation: he will no longer disorient himself). Cost is legible—the halo fragment shatters, he collapses—but the closure beat leans on summary ("finally found peace") rather than a charged image. Orientation anchors appear early (topaz workshop, letterpress, vanishing stars). One meaningful deepening occurs when the unsigned letter multiplies the borrowed selves beyond recovery, forcing the stance shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and vanishing stars are vividly established and recur throughout, creating atmospheric coherence. The halo fragment is handled physically (placed in the press, pulsed, shattered), meeting the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography remains generic—we never learn how the press mechanism constrains movement or how the workshop layout affects Aris's choices. The stars function as mood rather than pressure; their vanishing does not alter tactics or options on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: quantify emotion through transposed empathy. Pressure accumulates across three letters (widow, inventor, unsigned) with escalating intensity until Aris is overwhelmed by a cacophony of borrowed selves. The unsigned letter tightens by multiplying sources, but this coincidence complicates rather than tests a prior choice. Agency at closure is renunciation (he stops borrowing), and the halo fragment's shattering provides visible cost. The piece lacks a moment where Aris must choose between competing goods under duress; the flood of voices resolves the question for him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the hubris of quantifying emotion and the cost of empathy without boundaries. The topaz glow, vanishing stars, and halo fragment recur with purpose, shifting from tools to symbols of fragmentation. The final image—new constellation forming, Aris finding peace in his own heart's turbulence—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, "deliberate ambiguity of feeling was its own beauty" edges into thematic summary. The mathematics-of-emotion conceit is well-sustained through logarithmic decay and differential equations grounded in his ledger work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens during empathy surges ("He staggered, the lucid turbulence..."). Diction is voice-consistent—"cryptic operator," "geometric patterns of pain"—with purposeful elevation that fits the analytical-mystical register. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") appear but remain voice-motivated. The piece teaches its pattern of formulaic phrasing ("deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence") early and sustains it, reading as intentional rather than artifactual. Perceptual signature is clear: Aris notices mathematical structures in emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrase stems dominate: "The..." openers recur across fifteen paragraphs, creating template cadence. "Lucid turbulence" and "deliberate ambiguity" appear three times each without reweighting, reading as phrase-padding. Paraphrase loops: "the stars vanishing faster" restates the established motif without added pressure. Sentence-level propulsion is uneven—some beats advance crisply ("He inked the plates..."), others stall on restatement ("They now lived within him, a cacophony of selves vying for control" echoes the prior overwhelm). No figurative muddle, but density suffers from synonym churn and scaffolding. Grammar and sequence remain clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—letterpress as empathy apparatus, mathematics of emotion—offers a fresh angle. However, the arc closely follows the hubris-overwhelm-renunciation template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The vanishing stars and topaz glow function as atmospheric décor rather than constraints that shape Aris's tactics. The unsigned letter's flood of voices is a late rule change (multi-source empathy not established earlier) that solves the thematic question for him. Risk is present in the unconventional premise but does not extend to structure or emotional complexity; Aris remains more concept than contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aris operates the press in three beats (widow, inventor, unsigned letter), each involving a choice to insert the halo fragment and activate the mechanism. His final decision to stop borrowing personalities shapes the closure. Setup is immediate, middle development includes recording emotions in his ledger, and closure hinges on his renunciation. Causal pressure is present but diluted by the unsigned letter's coincidental arrival. The character is essential but not indispensable; the role could transfer to another operator with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, partial causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in all three press operations (widow, inventor, unsigned), is described as "pulsing" with accumulated empathy, and shatters at closure to release stored essences. Setup is early (paragraph 7), middle development shows it glowing brighter, and closure depends on its destruction. It constrains Aris's method (required for transposition) and its shattering marks the turning point. Specificity is high—crystalline light that captures emotional essences—but the mechanics remain abstract. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.5, slight abstraction −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transposed empathy drives all three press sequences and defines the stakes: Aris seeks to quantify emotion by borrowing it. The concept shapes his tactics (typesetting, halo fragment use, ledger recording) and forces the crisis when multiple sources overwhelm him. Setup is immediate, middle beats demonstrate the mechanics, and closure turns on the realization that empathy cannot be mastered. The concept is indispensable to the plot but leans toward thematic echo in the final paragraph ("transposed empathy was not from a single person but from many"). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.3, slight thematic summary −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The trait is declared early ("habitually borrowed personalities") and demonstrated in all three press operations. Each borrowing leaves Aris "more fragmented," and the cacophony of borrowed selves at closure results from this habit. However, the cost is told rather than shown in micro-choices; we don't see him struggle to return to his own identity mid-operation or choose to borrow despite visible harm. Setup is immediate, middle beats repeat the pattern, closure depends on the accumulation. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, partial cost visibility +0.4, label-heavy execution −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as both method ("designed to disorient") and effect ("disorienting him with its intensity," "disorienting his senses beyond recovery"). The action defines the empathy-transfer mechanism and precipitates the crisis when the unsigned letter's ambiguity disorients him irreversibly. Setup is mid-story (paragraph 12), middle beats repeat the effect, and closure hinges on the final disorientation that forces renunciation. The term does causal work but could be replaced with "overwhelm" or "fracture" without structural loss. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, swappability −0.5, late first appearance (paragraph 12, ~40% mark) −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method is named twice ("deliberate ambiguity of the process," "deliberate ambiguity of feeling") but its mechanics remain abstract. The piece asserts that ambiguity ensures "pure, unfiltered empathy" without showing how blurring self/other differs from direct emotional transfer. The unsigned letter's ambiguity (love and loss in equal measure) triggers the final flood, linking method to closure, but the causality is weak—any intense letter could produce the same result. Setup mid-story, closure linkage present, but development is ornamental. Two touches +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental middle −0.8, swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored early with vivid detail (walls glow amber, letterpress central) and recurs throughout ("topaz workshop seemed to spin," "above his workshop"). The topaz itself is used materially—powdered into ink—constraining Aris's method. Stars frame the narrative but do not alter tactics. The setting provides atmosphere and one resource (powdered topaz) but does not pressure choices; Aris could perform the experiments elsewhere with minor adjustments. Early signal +0.7, recurring presence +0.9, one material constraint (ink) +0.6, closure mention +0.5, low tactical pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between the vanishing stars" bookends the narrative and is mentioned six times, creating atmospheric unity. Stars "continued to vanish," "dwindled to a handful," then "ceased vanishing" at closure, marking a before/after shift. However, time does not tighten decisions—Aris works through letters at his own pace with no urgency. The stars function as mood and symbolic parallax rather than a live clock. Early signal +0.6, recurring +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, ornamental middle (no tactical pressure) −0.9, swappability (any celestial change would serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("To understand the mathematics of emotion") and sustained through ledger entries (logarithmic decay, differential equations, chaotic systems). It drives all three press operations and shapes the closure realization (emotion is not to be mastered). However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—Aris never hesitates, fears failure, or weighs the cost against the goal mid-operation. Setup immediate +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, partial dramatization (told pursuit) +0.5, lack of friction (want vs. cost) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is named three times and enacted through the borrowing sequences: analytical clarity (logarithmic decay notation) clashing with overwhelming emotion (staggering, laughing, crying). Tone modulates with pressure—calm typesetting gives way to chaotic overwhelm—and the final image ("lucid turbulence of his own heart") charges the closure. However, the phrase reads as a label applied to beats rather than emerging organically from syntax and rhythm. Two named uses +0.9, enacted modulation +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, label-reliance −0.5, partial rhythm embodiment +0.0.</comment>
