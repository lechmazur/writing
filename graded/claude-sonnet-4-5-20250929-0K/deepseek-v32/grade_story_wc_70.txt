<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's "involuntarily truthful" trait is told but never meaningfully constrains a choice—he simply narrates facts we already see dramatized. His stated motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" remains abstract label-speak rather than embodied conflict; the line "routine without truth is empty" reads like therapy-speak at a pivotal beat. The stranger functions as pure convenience, appearing with the matchbox and disappearing without pressure or resistance. Internal contradiction is absent; Aris moves through beats without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is unclear: the piece begins as Causal (blackout → beehive failure → cascade), shifts to treasure-hunt Situational (riddle → archive), then resolves via deus ex machina (manual discharge restores power). Orientation anchors who/where by ~150 words but "after the city-wide blackout" timeframe remains vague throughout. The closure—Aris handing out riddle copies at his toll booth—lacks visible cost; the blackout is fixed, the truth will be told, and no option is foreclosed. The lacquer box reveal (SynthHoney sabotage) does not narrow tactics or alter Aris's stance in a legible way; he was already candid and the plot gives him a convenient technical fix.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower supplies vivid anchors (spires, observation deck, control room, archive) and the manual discharge sequence uses the tower's stored energy to drive the climax. "Nectar-dusk sky" recurs purposefully to frame the atmosphere. However, spatial choreography blurs during the stranger's arrival and descent to the archive; the tower's internal layout (stairs, rooms, beehive network connection) is sketched rather than grounded. The setting constrains one key choice (using stored lightning) but much of the description is postcard-level without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore power and reveal sabotage—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. The riddle is solved instantly without struggle, the lacquer box yields documents with no resistance, and the manual discharge succeeds on first attempt. The stranger offers cooperation rather than opposition. One tightening occurs when Aris decides to "fix what we can, then share the truth," but this is a cooperative pivot rather than a choice under pressure with visible cost. Coincidence (stranger arrives with matchbox, systems remain intact) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of "preserving wonder through truth" is declared multiple times in prompt-language ("I preserve wonder by seeking truth, even when it's harsh" and "preserving wonder meant embracing truth") rather than earned through scene particulars. The lacquer box and beehive imagery recur but do not reweight meaning at closure; the final paragraph moralizes ("seek truth in small things and preserve wonder in daily lives"). The riddle and SynthHoney sabotage add conceptual detail but the piece resolves into a tidy lesson rather than ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Aris's perceptual signature—"nectar dusk," "liquid light," "velvet canvas"—is consistent if somewhat ornamental. Dialogue between Aris and the stranger is functional and goal-driven but lacks subtext or vocal distinction; both speak in similar declarative registers. The stranger's line "That's why I came to you; your truthfulness is a beacon" feels expository. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are used sparingly. Voice modulates appropriately across beats but does not deepen under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("liquid light," "pinpricks in a velvet canvas") is controlled. However, minor loops appear: "He understood immediately" followed by narration of what he understood; "The blackout was ending, but the truth remained to be told" then "I will reveal this to everyone" repeats the same beat. Stock metaphor in "sound sweeter than any symphony" and "beacon in this darkened city." The climactic discharge sequence ("Blue energy arced...streaming...like liquid light") uses clear, propulsive syntax. Paragraph cuts are mostly purposeful but the final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the aftermath. Scaffold phrasing: "his motivation surfacing" is tell-not-show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—lightning tower + drone beehive failure + sabotage conspiracy—combines familiar tech-dystopia and whistleblower tropes without transformation. The riddle ("Where light is stored, the key is poured") is resolved instantly with no fresh angle. Aris's "involuntarily truthful" trait could offer friction but remains ornamental. The ending—hero restores power, reveals truth, distributes riddles—follows a median satisfaction template. "Nectar dusk" and beehive imagery add texture but the emotional arc and resolution feel derivative of countless "lone truth-teller vs. corporation" plots.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris (candid toll keeper) is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns. He observes the blackout, reads the riddle, retrieves the box, and initiates the discharge—all cooperative, linear moves without trade-offs. The attribute "candid" is told but not tested; his decision to "reveal this to everyone" costs nothing since he "cannot lie" anyway. Present and functional but replaceable with any competent technician.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in two beats: retrieval from the archive shelf and opening to reveal documents. Its ornate description (black with gold filigree, bees and lightning bolts) is vivid but the box itself is passive container. Aris holds it at the end "as a symbol of hidden wonders" but this is asserted rather than reweighted through action. The box's aesthetic ties to theme (bees, lightning) but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; any locked drawer would serve the same plot function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure triggers the blackout, shapes Aris's stake (restore pollination, prevent ecosystem collapse), and the manual discharge to reactivate the beehives forms the climax. The concept appears early, drives the archive search (programming errors, SynthHoney sabotage documents), and reappears at closure when the drones resume work and "the city bloomed again." However, the beehive mechanics remain abstract; we do not see how the discharge repairs the sabotaged programming or why systems stayed intact. Functional causal role across beats but the on-page mechanics are glossed.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Aris's "involuntarily truthful" trait is introduced in paragraph three and mentioned twice more ("being involuntarily truthful, felt compelled to speak" and "I cannot lie" at the end). It never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—Aris freely narrates his suspicions and plans without friction. The stranger chose him for this trait, but Aris does not struggle with unwanted honesty or face a dilemma where truth exacts a price. Label-only; swappable with "naturally honest" or "principled."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reveal (SynthHoney sabotage documents in the lacquer box) is the story's central discovery and motivates Aris's final decision to share the truth widely. It appears at the structural midpoint and recurs in the resolution when Aris distributes copies and tells the story. However, the reveal itself is passive (documents handed to Aris) rather than earned through struggle, and the consequences (outrage, distributing riddles) are told in summary. Major turn depends on this action but the on-page execution lacks cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the cryptic riddle is introduced when the stranger offers it, and the riddle's solution ("lacquer box in the tower's archive") drives the next beat. However, the matchbox itself is inert—Aris solves the riddle instantly without trial. The riddle mechanics do not shape attempts or tactics; it functions as a single-use key rather than a method with evolving stakes. Present in two beats (offer and solution) but swappable with any brief clue (note, whispered hint).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower provides spatial structure (plaza, observation deck, archive, control room) and its stored energy enables the climactic manual discharge that reactivates the beehives. Aris's knowledge of the tower's layout and systems is essential to the solution. The tower recurs at closure when Aris and the stranger leave it under night sky. The setting drives two major beats (archive search, discharge) and supplies the resource that resolves the blackout, though the control-room mechanics are sketched rather than grounded in embodied detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the city-wide blackout" anchors the initial condition and the beehive failure's urgency (no new blooms, ecosystem threat) is stated early. However, elapsed time remains vague—Aris climbs the tower, searches the archive, and discharges energy without a legible clock. The timeframe does not tighten decisions; Aris moves at a steady pace with no visible time pressure. The ending jumps to "the next day" in summary. Present but does not constrain tactics or shape the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is introduced in paragraph four and explicitly restated twice ("I preserve wonder by seeking truth" and "preserving wonder meant embracing truth" in the final paragraph). It is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The motivation does not face friction—Aris wants to restore wonder, finds the sabotage, fixes the tower, and shares the truth with no cost or trade-off between wonder and pragmatism. Told-only; lacks on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" appears in the opening line, recurs in "the twilight that tasted like spoiled nectar," and frames the resolution when "the city bloomed again, under nectar dusk skies that seemed to glow with renewed promise." The tone is consistent (elegiac, amber-lit) and modulates slightly from loss to renewal. However, it remains a static atmospheric layer rather than tightening under pressure; the dusk does not charge the final image with new meaning or cost, it simply bookends the narrative with similar descriptive texture.</comment>
