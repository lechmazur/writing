<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is present but abstract, relying heavily on "the watcher's burden" label rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His micro-choices (reconfiguring the array, revising protocol) are there, but motivation reads more like duty-template than embodied conflict. The parachute buckle is invoked as symbol rather than constraint that forces a trade-off. Emotional embodiment is thin—no degradation under stress, no hypocrisy or self-deception, just steady resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes "hope" and "resolve" with the buckle as testament—but the cost is asserted ("burden carried and shared") rather than shown in a forfeited option or visible price. The debris-field complication and protocol revision provide one meaningful tightening, but the escalation is told in summary beats ("he began to work," "he finalized") rather than dramatized with friction. Orientation is clear early; the two-shard window (nocturnal arbor → central console) is legible, but the closure lands softer than required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is evocative but remains postcard description—glass-domed corridors, star-flecked void—without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The parachute buckle functions more as motif than micro-setting that shapes action. Sensory detail is selective (whisper of breath, click of keys) but doesn't modulate with urgency; the arbor feels like backdrop rather than lived environment. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the console setting provides a functional anchor for the work, keeping this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent system failure, preserve trust—is signaled early and tightens once (corrupted data forces improvisation). However, escalation unfolds in summary: "He began to work," "He finalized the revisions." No visible trade-off dramatized on the page (Does he skip a station? sacrifice accuracy for speed?). The debris field raises external pressure, but Aris's agency in the peak beat is muscle-memory execution, not a choice that forecloses a live option with felt cost. One meaningful tightening is present, but the cost clarity required for higher bands is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of duty, second chances, and the watcher's burden emerges, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "that was the weight and the worth of being a midnight pattern seeker." The parachute buckle recurs but shifts meaning through assertion ("once a symbol of failure, now represented a second chance") rather than through dramatized cost. Subtext in gesture and image is minimal; the story leans on prompt labels ("attentively inventive," "preserve trust") instead of letting particulars build resonance. No earned epiphany from struggle—Aris already knows his duty and executes it smoothly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and perceptual signature is consistent (nocturnal technician filtering stimuli through vigilance and memory). Diction remains within Aris's lexicon without unmotivated register shifts. However, internal texture is repetitive: recycled stems like "He moved," "He reached," "He worked" create template cadence. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (zooming into buckle sensation, pulling back for arbor overview). Voice is functional but lacks rhythmic variety under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "The watcher's burden" and variants appear five times; "muscle memory" is invoked in consecutive paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He moved," "He reached," "He began," "He worked," "He thought"). Stock metaphors ("star-flecked void," "cage suspended in eternity") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "felt like a cage") dull immediacy. Information density is low in peak beats—key work is summarized rather than shown with propulsion. Clarity is fine, but momentum drags under scaffold weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—lone technician in orbital station facing debris threat—is a familiar genre template executed competently but without fresh synthesis. The parachute buckle as talisman of past failure is a stock redemption arc beat. Emotional progression is linear and predictable (doubt → resolve → hope). No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus; Aris's choice to "preserve trust" and "revise the plan" is the median safe option with no ambiguity or counter-reading invited. Specific lived detail (muscle memory at console) offers some texture, but the core remains derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Midnight pattern seeker is present throughout (scanning stars, detecting anomalies, revising protocol), but Aris's role is more observer-executor than decision-maker who creates key turns. His choices (reconfigure array, prioritize vulnerable stations) are competent responses, not dilemmas that alter tactics with visible cost. The trait enables action but doesn't constrain or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Parachute buckle appears in four beats: belt anchor (para 5), tactile reminder during work (para 22), symbol transformation (para 39), final testament (para 41). However, it is never handled or used—only invoked as emotional anchor. Its meaning shifts (failure → duty → second chance) through assertion rather than dramatized cost. Present across beats but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic, only thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is introduced early (para 7), recurs (para 23, 34), and frames the ending (para 42). It shapes Aris's stake (duty to see doom and prevent it) and motivates his work, but the concept is told rather than shown—no on-page moment where the burden forces a specific tactic or trade-off. It operates as theme claim more than constraint that alters choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Attentively inventive is stated (para 8, 24, 40) and demonstrated via bypassing damaged circuits and weaving fragments, but these actions are summarized without friction or visible cost. The trait enables success rather than constraining it with a trade-off (speed vs. accuracy, coverage vs. safety). Label-only in peak beats; no moment where inventiveness fails or exacts a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Revise appears as the inciting problem (corrupted data, para 18) and the resolution (revised evacuation sequence, para 29; finalized revisions, para 35). The action drives two major beats and defines Aris's task. However, the revision itself is summarized—no on-page friction showing what he changes or what prior plan he discards. Essential to plot but enacted off-camera, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Remembering through muscle memory is signaled early (para 11–12) and used twice: bypassing circuits (para 25) and initiating protocol (para 32–33). The mechanics matter—his hands move "without thought," born of repetition—and enable his speed under pressure. However, muscle memory never constrains or fails him; it's purely facilitative. Present in setup and middle but absent from closure image, and no cost tied to relying on it versus deliberate thought.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor above the clouds is introduced early (para 1, 11) and frames the ending (para 38). The glass-domed corridors and central console provide spatial anchors, and the arbor's height isolates Aris from those below, sharpening trust stakes. However, the setting never constrains a choice—no resource scarcity, no environmental hazard beyond the abstract debris field. Evocative backdrop that supports tone but doesn't alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>After the radio static clears appears in the opening (para 2), middle (para 27), and ending (para 37), marking narrative phases. The timeframe signals urgency ("before time ran out") but the clock itself is vague—no countdown, no tracked elapsed minutes. The debris collision is "imminent" without dramatized tightening (how long does he have?). Present but untracked; time pressure is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To preserve trust under pressure is introduced early (para 14–15), recurs during protocol work (para 30, 36), and anchors the ending theme (para 40). The desire is clear and motivates Aris's choices (prioritize vulnerable stations, make decisions "seem effortless and sure"). However, trust is never tested by friction—no moment where speed conflicts with thoroughness, or where transparency risks panic. Stated and pursued but not conflicted with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Soundless echo appears four times (para 19, 26, 38, 39), establishing a tone of quiet concentration and restraint. The phrase modulates slightly (failures, concentration, resolve) and charges the final image by spreading through the station. Coherent and purposeful, but the tone itself is static—no shift from dread to hope viscerally rendered; the mood is declared rather than enacted through syntax or rhythm. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but doesn't constrain choice or escalate pressure.</comment>
