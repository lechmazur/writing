<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope is clear and her observation role fits, but her interior life remains thin—we see her notice and feel "an ache," yet contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene. The decision to program counter-dreams arrives without dramatized struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply "decided" and acts. The river stone recurs but functions as a static symbol rather than constraining choice. Embodied emotion is present in brief gestures (stone heavy in palm) but therapy-speak creeps in: "luminous regret" as a label rather than lived sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story accumulates imagery (crystalline spires, blooming library, shadow) and attempts a final cadence shift when the shadow integrates. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines, satisfying the test. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the shadow binds, dreams evolve, Elara accepts change—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page: "she had altered its essence" tells us the price without showing a forfeited path or a choice that narrowed options. The Because/therefore linkage from discovery to intervention to transformation reads more as outline sequencing than pressure-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Blooming Library above clouds is vivid and consistent (crystalline spires, cloud sea, observation nook), and the setting participates in the ending when "new spires emerging like petals" visualizes the metamorphose. The river stone functions as micro-setting, grounding Elara and charging the final image when she places it on her desk. Sensory detail is selective (dusk light, polished floor, soft pulse) and filtered through Elara's "sharp-eyed" noticing. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location. No occupational systems are needed here, so their absence does not penalize.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara discovers the unbound shadow and programs counter-dreams, narrowing the dreamscape's trajectory. Agency is decision-based (she "decided to use the library's own systems"), yet the intervention succeeds without friction, cost, or trade-off visible on the page. The escalation reads as accumulative density (shadow discovery → counter-dream sequence → metamorphose) rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. No antagonist or reversal is required under the Accumulative lens, but the cost clarity needed for high bands is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the inevitability of change and the cost of preservation—emerges from the river stone's evolving symbolism (permanence → change) and the shadow's integration (innocence lost, resilience gained). The final image of Elara placing the stone and watching the transformed dreamscape offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Yet "luminous regret" and "the shape of hope" repeat as abstract labels rather than being fully embodied in concrete action. The insight "she had preserved the shape of hope, but in doing so, she had altered its essence" inches toward thesis statement rather than arising implicitly from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Voice has some texture ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("metamorphose," "luminous regret") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices light shifts, shadows, the tactile stone—but does not deeply individuate her noticing patterns. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression in the accumulative design is legible, and reflection anchors in present stimuli (screens, river stone), meeting BRR without penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several prose artifacts accumulate: "softly deliberate" appears twice in identical phrasing, "shape of hope" recurs four times without reweighting, and the template stem "The [noun] [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors cluster in the closure beat: dreams "bloom," shadows "stretch," and "luminous regret" conflates light with emotion without a clear vehicle. The paraphrase loop "preserve the shape of hope" / "altered its essence" restates the same idea across adjacent lines. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.6 for loops and template cadence, escalated to −0.9 because metaphor muddle touches the closure image. Additionally, "metamorphose" as a noun is non-standard usage, reducing clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a library of shareable dreams above clouds, shadows leaching hope—combines familiar SFF tropes (dream archives, floating cities, unbound entities) without a sharp transformation. The shadow's integration and Elara's counter-dream programming feel like median genre moves rather than specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth is present in Elara's acceptance tinged with regret, but the arc (observer → intervener → watcher again) follows a predictable path. The river stone and "luminous regret" offer some texture, yet could be swapped for other symbolic objects and moods with minor edits. No bold structural risk or perspectival ingenuity elevates the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation role ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") is established early. She makes one key decision—programming counter-dreams—that alters the dreamscape's trajectory. However, the choice is told rather than dramatized with visible friction or cost, and her "sharp-eyed" noticing functions more as a job description than a trait that constrains tactics. She appears in the closure beat watching the transformed library, but the ending emphasizes acceptance rather than a decision that redefines options. Two-gate presence (setup, closure participation) without strong middle development or causal pressure limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three distinct beats: Elara holds it early ("tactile reminder"), feels its weight mid-story ("heavy in her palm"), and places it on her desk at closure ("testament to the journey"). Its meaning evolves from permanence to symbol of inevitable change, and the final placement charges the ending image. However, the stone does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains a contemplative object rather than a causal agent. Strong closure linkage and meaning-shift lift the score, but lack of causal pressure and visible cost keep it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound from its source" is discovered early through Elara's video analysis, drives her intervention (programming counter-dreams to bind it), and transforms at closure when the shadow integrates into dream narratives. The concept shapes stakes (prevent hope erosion) and tactics (infusing archived hope into counter-dreams), meeting all three gates. The shadow's final state—"bound, but not confined"—reweights prior material with a visible outcome. Causal pressure and closure participation are strong. The only friction: the shadow's mechanics remain somewhat abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice as a descriptor of Elara's actions ("steps softly deliberate," "actions were softly deliberate"), but it functions as a stylistic label rather than a trait that constrains or enables choices under pressure. No on-page moment shows this attribute creating a trade-off or altering tactics; she moves carefully, but the story does not dramatize a cost or friction arising from deliberateness versus speed. Present in setup and mentioned at a key beat, but ornamental use and lack of causal work limit the score to functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is signaled early ("to understand the metamorphose... within the dream library"), drives the story's conceptual center, and culminates on-page when "the metamorphose unfolded, a transformation of chaos into order" and the library blooms further. The action shapes Elara's goal (restore balance through transformation) and appears in the closure beat. However, the actual process is summarized—"the dreamscape began to shift, the fragments coalescing"—rather than dramatized with specific tactics or visible friction. Strong presence across all three gates and closure linkage, but swappability with "transformation" and summary treatment prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent video footage from decades apart—is established early and occupies a full paragraph where Elara sets up screens and watches sequences. The comparison reveals the core discovery (shadow unbound, fragmented dreams), driving her intervention. However, the mechanics of the comparison do not shape later attempts; once the discovery is made, the footage vanishes from the narrative. Two-gate presence (setup, middle development) without closure participation or tactical constraint limits the score. The method is functional but could be replaced with other archival analysis tools without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is anchored early ("suspended above the clouds, its crystalline spires") and participates actively at closure when "the library responded, its crystalline structures pulsing with soft light" and "new spires emerging like petals." The setting's "blooming" quality mirrors the metamorphose theme and the library's systems enable Elara's intervention. However, the setting does not pressure choices or constrain tactics during the middle beats; Elara's observation nook and the screens are described but do not alter her options. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure, but missing middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams become shareable" is established in the opening paragraph and provides world context (the library "had grown into a living archive" post-sharing). However, it functions as backstory rather than a live pressure. No clock or deadline tightens Elara's decisions; "lately, she sensed a change" and "today, she was tasked" offer vague temporal markers without urgency. The timeframe does not alter tactics or shape the ending's stakes. Present in setup but lacks development and closure participation, and the absence of time pressure keeps it in the functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to preserve the shape of hope that dreams once carried" is stated early and drives her discovery of hope's erosion and her decision to intervene. The phrase "shape of hope" recurs throughout, and the closure reveals friction: "she had preserved the shape of hope, but in doing so, she had altered its essence." Desire meets cost in the ending. However, the motivation is asserted more than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara torn between competing wants or struggling with the intervention's implications before acting. Three-gate presence and closure cost lift the score, but the lack of embodied conflict during the choice moment caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone "luminous regret" is woven throughout: "her heart ached with the beauty and sadness," "a pang of luminous regret," and the ending's "peace tinged with regret, a luminous acceptance." The phrase recurs with consistent connotation (light + sorrow), modulates with pressure (discovery → intervention → acceptance), and charges the final image when Elara finds "luminous acceptance of what was and what could be." The tone is coherent and purposeful. However, "luminous regret" as a lexical pairing feels slightly authorial rather than emerging from scene pressure, and the repetition borders on over-determined. Strong closure linkage and modulation across beats.</comment>
