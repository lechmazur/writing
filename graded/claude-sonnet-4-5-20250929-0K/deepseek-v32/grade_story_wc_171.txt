<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "operatively gentle" attribute appears as a label repeated four times without constraining a difficult choice or revealing internal conflict. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("price of redemption," "flawed beauty") rather than character-particular perception. The general's skepticism provides the only friction, but Elara's response is a composed aphorism, not a decision under pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first ~100 words. The dominant stake—ending the forever war—is signaled early, but escalation reads as a single extended negotiation without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The climax (delegates signing at dawn) is told in summary ("they argued deep into the night") rather than dramatized, and the cost of signing remains abstract rather than shown through a forfeited option or immediate consequence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, but the price is asserted in theme language ("flawed beauty," "fragile dawn") without a concrete image or action that makes the cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The terrace setting is vivid and purposeful: marble cracked by time, night-blooming jasmine, twin moons, celestial maps on the table. The midsummer conjunction and inscribed stone table anchor ritual significance and constrain the negotiation's framing. However, the setting does not alter a tactical choice or supply a resource that changes the outcome; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The body and clipboard receive concrete handling across multiple beats, elevating the micro-setting contribution slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ending the war) is clear, but pressure remains static through a single extended negotiation. The general's objection provides brief friction, but Elara's response ("It is redemption") resolves it through rhetoric rather than a trade-off that forecloses an option. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows tactics; the delegates' "fragile consensus" emerges off-page during summarized argument. The signing is outcome, not escalation, and the cost (lost lives, forgiven crimes) is told rather than dramatized as a visible forfeit at the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of redemption's price is explicit and repeated ("the price of redemption was high," "redemption always costs more than we wish to pay"), undercutting emergence from concrete particulars. "Flawed beauty" and "forever war/forever peace" recur as framing devices but do not deepen through shifting use. The final image (midsummer sun on ancient stones, Elara's smile) gestures toward resonance but remains ornamental rather than reweighting prior material with a non-literal answer. The story tells its thesis rather than allowing it to accrue through specific sacrifice or irreconcilable choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Elara as focalizer. Psychic distance is controlled, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("operatively gentle demeanor that disarmed fury," "cosmic harmony") that sits uneasily against her exhausted interiority. Dialogue is sparse and functional; the general's line and Elara's reply carry subtext but lack distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is generic (jasmine scent = redemption price) rather than character-specific. The prose modulates with emotional beats but does not degrade under peak pressure, reducing embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Phrase loops and template cadence appear throughout: "operatively gentle" (×4), "the price of redemption" (×3), "flawed beauty" (×3), "forever war" (×2). Stock metaphors ("stars wheeled overhead," "fragile dawn") and synonym churn ("clipboard was not just a tool; it was a testament") reduce information density. Paragraph-level paraphrase loops restate the same content ("The war had spanned centuries, a cycle of vengeance" immediately followed by "To end it, she had bargained"). Filter verbs ("felt heavy," "seemed to bless") stack in high-pressure beats without voice justification. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure image, triggering cumulative penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (lone negotiator brokers peace at symbolic site) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Operatively gentle" reads as a coined descriptor rather than an organically revealed trait. The clipboard, terrace, and celestial conjunction are genre-appropriate but do not synthesize into an inevitable design. Emotional beats (weary delegates, Elara's ache) and thematic anchors (redemption, sacrifice) are earnest but predictable. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the piece occupies a safe middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (negotiator) frames the premise. However, she does not make on-page choices that create key turns; she guides, waits, and responds with rhetoric. Her decisions (invoking ritual, embedding symbolic gestures) are recounted in summary rather than dramatized as pressured choices that alter tactics. The signing is observer role, not agency. Present in closure but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clipboard appears in beat one (heavy against her chest), is placed on the table, and is signed at dawn. It returns at closure ("clutched the clipboard"). However, its function does not evolve; it remains a container for the accords without constraining a tactical choice or being reweighted in meaning. Handled physically across three beats but not irreplaceable—any document would serve the same plot function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is stated explicitly five times as theme language but never shapes an on-page decision where Elara or a delegate weighs competing goods and pays a visible cost tied to this concept. It echoes as abstract framing rather than altering options or tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is a label repeated four times without constraining or enabling a single on-page action with visible cost. Elara's demeanor is described ("disarmed fury," "buffer against rising tempers") but not dramatized through a choice where gentleness forecloses a harsher option or exacts a price. Token attribute without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: "muster the final fragments of her resolve" and "mustered not just an agreement, but a chance for healing." Both instances are summary rather than dramatized action. No major turn traces to this verb as enacted choice; it functions as metaphorical framing. Present but swappable with "gathered" or "summoned" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early (old traditions, midsummer, celestial maps, water-sharing ceremony, joint vigil) and frames the negotiation's method. However, its mechanics do not alter a tactical attempt or force a trade-off; it provides atmosphere and cultural rationale. The ritual setting enables the meeting but does not shape a contested choice. Functional setup and minor middle development, but no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is introduced in the opening line, described with concrete detail (cracked marble, twin moons, circular stone table with celestial maps), and anchors the closure image (midsummer sun on stones). It provides symbolic resonance and spatial grounding but does not supply a resource or constraint that alters a tactic. Strong setup and closure reprise, but no middle development where the terrace pressures a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The celestial dance (slow conjunction of twin moons) is mentioned in the title phrase and twice in narration ("stars wheeled overhead," "stars traced their ancient paths"). Dawn arrives to mark the signing. However, elapsed time is not tracked or used to tighten decisions; the delegates "argued deep into the night" without a visible clock that alters tactics. Present as mood rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" appears once as Elara's stated goal ("We are here to conclude what our ancestors could not") and is echoed in narration ("To anchor ideals in practice, she had embedded symbolic gestures"). Her motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices where the friction between ideals and cost forces a visible trade-off. Present but summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is stated three times and applied to the terrace, the peace, and the dawn. Tone is elegiac and consistent but does not modulate meaningfully with pressure; it remains a static descriptive layer rather than charging the final image with earned complexity. The phrase is ornamental rather than emergent from the story's specific tensions.</comment>
