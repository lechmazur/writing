<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to audit the archive and expose fraud is clear and sustained, though his interior life remains thin—we see his choices but rarely feel contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The board members' relief at the end ("We thought Elara was the thief") arrives cleanly but their prior cover-up is told rather than dramatized, softening the earned quality of their shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; Leo "stilled," "chose," "saw"—functional verbs that advance plot without visceral particularity under pressure. The final choice feels more procedural than wrenching, meeting the causal standard but not charging it with visible internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Leo's projection of the magnified evidence catalyzes the board's confession and thaws mistrust, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the institution, relief for the staff) with conceptual cost legible in Silas and Greta's acknowledgment of their complicity. The causal lens holds—Leo's discovery of the lens → magnification → public revelation → reconciliation—and the meaning shift is clear. Orientation anchors quickly (registrar, concert hall, archive audit). One meaningful tightening occurs when the eavesdropped conversation ("The lens is the proof") narrows Leo's search and raises stakes, though the escalation is more investigative than pressure-driven, and the final confrontation is oddly friction-free, resolved by shared sight rather than contested choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "crystal whispering forecourt" recurs at opening, middle (meeting site), and closure, and the "wet paving stones" / "glistening stones" after rain charge the final image with reflective transparency that mirrors the thematic work. Spatial choreography is clean (forecourt → auditorium archway → tech closet → office → forecourt). However, the setting functions more as stage dressing than constraint: no environmental detail narrows Leo's options or shapes his tactics—he moves freely through unlocked spaces, and the "resonant hush" remains atmospheric rather than pressuring choice. The lens as micro-object does constrain (it enables revelation), but the forecourt itself is more motif than agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing Elara's name and resolving budget discrepancies to restore institutional trust—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the eavesdrop reveals the lens is proof, narrowing Leo's search and raising urgency. The climactic projection visibly alters the board's stance, though the resolution is curiously frictionless: no one resists, no competing loyalties surface, and the confession arrives in whispered relief rather than contested struggle. Agency is Leo's throughout (audit → eavesdrop → decode → reveal), and coincidence does not resolve, but the cost feels more institutional than personal—Leo's own risk or sacrifice remains abstract, and the final "unburdened faces" read as collective closure without a visible price paid by the protagonist on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—transparency thaws mistrust, hidden systems distort trust—emerges organically from the lens revelation and the board's confession without moralizing. The final image of "unburdened faces" and "looking at the same truth" offers a non-literal answer to the opening frost, and the lens-as-revelation motif accumulates meaning across beats (memento → magnifier → evidence projector). However, "freed by honesty" tilts close to a thesis statement, and the phrase "not by accusation, but by shared sight" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. Subtext operates cleanly in the eavesdropped exchange and Leo's silent projection choice, but the ending's reconciliation feels idealized—mistrust dissolved too tidily, with no lingering ambiguity or cost to complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping, and the third-person limited lens stays close to Leo. Dialogue carries goal-driven subtext ("The lens is the proof" / "just her paranoid sketches") and the board's confession feels naturally hesitant. Voice is serviceable—controlled, quiet—but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature: Leo notices archive boxes, doodles, and the lens with professional neutrality rather than character-particular bias. Stock phrasings appear: "motivation was simple," "with painful clarity," "resonant hush," "unburdened faces." Distance control is consistent, but the narrator's voice reads more like neutral reportage than an interior rhythm shaped by Leo's specific mind under pressure. The final paragraph's "In that quiet, everything was resolved" tells rather than shows the shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or major artifacts. Sentence openings vary adequately, though several beats rely on filter verbs ("He believed," "He saw," "He felt") that dull immediacy. Stock phrases reduce texture: "with painful clarity," "resonant hush," "unburdened faces," "words became unnecessary" (repeated twice). The metaphor "thaw the mistrust that had settled" → "thawed the deep frost" is coherent but predictable. Information density is uneven: the archive audit and lens discovery advance efficiently, but the final paragraph summarizes emotional resolution ("The transparency had thawed... not by accusation, but by shared sight") rather than trusting the image. The phrase "ambiguously clear" appears twice, once as meta-commentary ("The meaning was ambiguously clear") and once as closure reflection, bordering on thematic echo. Propulsion is steady but never urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core synthesis—magnifying lens reveals hidden financial codes in doodles—is clever and specific, and the non-obvious angle (archivist as whistleblower, not thief) avoids template fraud plots. The lens as both literal and thematic tool integrates neatly. However, the emotional arc is familiar: wronged colleague vindicated, institutional mistrust resolved by transparency. The board's instant capitulation and the frictionless collective epiphany echo wish-fulfillment more than earned complexity. The "crystal whispering forecourt" and "resonant hush" aim for atmosphere but trend generic-literary. Transformation test: swap the concert hall for a museum or library, the lens for a UV lamp, and the structure holds unchanged, signaling surface freshness over deep particularity. No bold risk; the piece stays safely in the middle of competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leo (night registrar) drives all major beats: audits archive (setup), eavesdrops (inciting choice), retrieves and uses the lens (middle turn), projects evidence (climactic decision). His observation initiates the eavesdrop beat, and his final silent projection—choosing transparency over private knowledge—alters tactics and forces the board's confession. The role "quiet night registrar" is essential to access (he works alone, after hours, with archive access) and tonal fit. Removing Leo or his choices would break the causal chain. Present early, shapes two distinct beats (eavesdrop, projection), and drives closure with visible cost (he risks institutional fallout by exposing the fraud publicly).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in three beats: mentioned by the projectionist (setup priming), retrieved and used to magnify the ticket (middle revelation), and implied in the projection of evidence at closure. Its unique property—magnification reveals hidden codes—is irreplaceable and causal: without the lens, Leo cannot decode the doodles or project proof. The lens is handled on the page ("heavy circle of polished glass," "held... over the doodled ticket," "projected... using the old lens"), and its use narrows options (from suspicion to proof) and enables the climactic turn. Early signal, beat involvement (retrieval, decoding, projection), causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost: the lens transforms institutional understanding and forecloses the cover-up path.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is stated explicitly ("He was freed by honesty—not just knowing it, but committing to act upon it") in the middle third, then thematically echoed at closure ("transparency had thawed"). The concept shapes Leo's climactic choice to project evidence publicly rather than report privately, a tactic-altering decision. However, the concept functions more as theme than on-page constraint—Leo's "freedom" is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost or friction. The final reconciliation illustrates the concept's success but does not test it against competing pressures. Present, causal in one beat (projection choice), but closer to interpretive lens than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" describes the doodles twice: first as diagnostic observation ("The meaning was ambiguously clear; it pointed to a system, but not its purpose"), then as reflection on collective misunderstanding ("The evidence was ambiguously clear only if one wished to misunderstand"). The attribute characterizes the puzzle but does not constrain Leo's on-page action—he decodes it cleanly with the lens, and the ambiguity dissolves. The phrase appears mid-story (not early setup), does not enable or block a choice with visible cost, and trends toward label-only theme claim. Functional as description, not as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is signaled early ("Instinctively, Leo stilled, then chose to eavesdrop"), drives the major turn (he learns "The lens is the proof," which narrows his search and raises stakes), and the intelligence gathered shapes his middle tactic (retrieving the lens) and closure move (projecting evidence to the same board members). The action is irreplaceable: without eavesdropping, Leo would not know to seek the lens, and the causal chain would break. The choice carries mild risk (discovery, professional boundary violation) though that cost is not dramatized. Present early, shapes two beats (lens retrieval, projection strategy), and causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method—cryptic doodles on concert tickets—is introduced early (archive box → doodled ticket margins with "tiny, precise schematics"), tested in the middle (lens magnification reveals hidden routing codes), and referenced at closure (projected ticket image). The doodles' mechanics matter: their physical encoding (numbers hidden in curves) requires the lens to decode, and that specificity drives the middle revelation. The method shapes Leo's attempt (he must find the right tool) and the final proof. Early signal, beat involvement (discovery, decoding, projection), causal necessity, and closure participation all present. Cost: the doodles were Elara's accusation, and their revelation vindicates her and exposes the cover-up.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" opens the story, hosts the climactic meeting, and closes with "unburdened faces" reflected on its "damp sheen." The setting recurs with charged imagery (wet stones → glistening stones, resonant hush → whisper) and the final projection uses the "pale stone wall" as screen. However, the forecourt does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome—Leo could project evidence anywhere, and the stones' reflective quality is thematic (transparency) rather than tactical. Lyric reprise with meaningful reweighting at closure, but lacks causal pressure. Early signal, closure linkage, specificity, but no middle development that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After words became unnecessary" is stated in the opening ("when the building was empty") and echoed at closure ("Words had, indeed, become unnecessary"). The timeframe sets tone (quiet, solitary audit) but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Leo works at his own pace, and no clock pressures his moves. The phrase reads more as atmospheric motif than constraint. Present early and at closure (lyric reprise), but no middle beat where time narrows options or raises cost. Ornamental rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Leo's motivation—"to thaw the mistrust that had settled over the staff"—is stated early and drives his audit, eavesdrop, and evidence projection. The desire is clear and consistent, though the friction between transparency and personal risk is told ("He was freed by honesty") rather than dramatized with visible on-page cost. The climactic projection enacts the motivation, and the closure confirms its success ("transparency had thawed the deep frost"). Early signal, shapes two beats (audit persistence, projection choice), and linked to closure. However, the motivation is not conflicted—Leo never doubts or pays a visible price—so the cost connection is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs throughout (opening forecourt, auditorium, closure) and modulates with pressure: the eavesdrop scene uses "low but strained" voices against the hush, and the final meeting unfolds in "low, reconciliatory tones" within the same quiet. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the concept (transparency in silence, words unnecessary). The hush charges the final image ("not empty, but full of understanding") with thematic weight. However, tone remains largely static—one sustained mood—and does not escalate or break under peak pressure. Early signal, coherent through turns, closure charge present, but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
