<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical nature is asserted rather than dramatized through choice. Her socially perceptive trait is claimed ("her socially perceptive nature tingling") but never constrains a decision or creates friction. The single word "Peace" constitutes her only on-page agency, and no visible cost or internal contradiction accompanies it. Interiority relies on abstract observation ("parsing sorrow from fear") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates whispers and patterns toward a final hush, satisfying RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) criteria. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines, avoiding penalty. However, the closure cost is abstract: the mandala is scattered, but no felt price—no forfeited opportunity, no relational or emotional trade-off—charges the final image. The "emergent hush" arrives as atmosphere, not as a choice-driven reconfiguration with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto and mist are vivid and consistent, establishing mood through selective sensory detail (damp air, cool stone, lilac unease). The tile flake and sand mandala function as micro-setting tools that constrain Elara's approach and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting pressures her method and mood, meeting the 9+ gate test narrowly, though occupational detail (chalk artist) remains ornamental and does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or meaningful tightening forecloses an option; Elara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-off, and faces no credible loss. Her single interjection ("Peace") meets no opposition and resolves the grotto's chaos without cost. The whispers dissolve "into understanding" without dramatized friction, leaving escalation absent and the final image uncharged by sacrifice or endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (unlearning as space for quiet clarity) emerges from image and event rather than statement. The sand mandala's scattering and the emergent hush offer a non-literal answer to the central question. However, lines like "meaning was not a single truth pulled from the mess, but the graceful pattern of its letting go" edge toward thematic echo, and the final paragraphs summarize resonance ("she had witnessed the grotto find its own voice in silence") rather than trusting the dramatized image to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, and psychic distance is controlled. Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("whimsical heart," "lilac unease"), though some phrases ("her socially perceptive nature tingling," "acoustic chaos") drift into elevated register not fully earned by the focalizer's demonstrated idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (she "listened not just to words, but to the feelings beneath them"), but the narrative relies on filter verbs and summary interiority ("parsing sorrow from fear") rather than letting perception act as character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The emergent hush now held the grotto in a gentle embrace" followed immediately by "She carefully scattered her sand mandala"; "The grotto faded behind her, holding its quiet like a secret" then "Elara… stepped back into the world, carrying a new palette of quiet colors." Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" and "The whispers [verb]" across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("blanket of silence," "world was shedding its old skins") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to swirl," "seemed to soften") dull immediacy in peak beats. Clarity remains intact, but density and propulsion suffer under redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—artist uses mandala to transform ambient chaos into hush—follows a familiar template (troubled setting + ritual intervention = resolution). The tile flake, sand mandala, and grotto setting feel assembled to prompt rather than organically synthesized. No turn arises from lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the whispers dissolve without resistance, and the transformation feels convenient. The "unlearning" frame is gestured at but never pressures Elara's choices, leaving the core premise derivative and under-transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her trait (whimsical chalk artist) frames her arrival and departure. However, her choices do not create key turns: she sits, traces sand, places the tile, speaks one word, scatters the mandala, and leaves. None of these actions narrows options or alters tactics under resistance. She observes and reacts to the grotto's autonomous transformation rather than driving it. Late-paragraph reflection on future chalk drawings is told, not enacted. Functional but replaceable; a similar character with a different artistic medium could perform the same role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery tile flake appears in three beats: drawn from pocket, placed at mandala's heart where it draws whispers and vibrates, then pocketed again at the end. It is handled on the page and its hum marks the shift toward hush, meeting setup, development, and closure gates. However, its mechanics are vague ("hummed with captured echoes," "vibrated softly") and its specific properties are not irreplaceable—any resonant object could serve. The final pocketing reweights it as "a token of the process" but does not tie a visible cost to its use, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Emergent hush is named and described repeatedly, appears in the closure image ("The emergent hush now held the grotto in a gentle embrace"), and reweights the whispers into stillness. However, it arrives as atmosphere rather than shaping stakes or tactics. Elara does not choose between hush and noise, nor does the hush impose cost or constraint. The concept is thematic resonance without causal pressure, meeting setup and closure gates but lacking middle-beat decision involvement. Present in the final image but not driving the protagonist's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Socially perceptive is claimed early ("her socially perceptive nature tingling") and mentioned once more ("her socially perceptive mind at rest"), but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No tradeoff, no friction, no dramatized choice reveals this trait under pressure. Label-only mention; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Interject occurs mid-story when Elara speaks the word "Peace," and the text frames this as a key moment ("Without thinking, Elara chose to interject"). The word ripples through space and the tile vibrates in response, linking the action to the emergent hush. However, no resistance, risk, or cost accompanies the interjection, and the grotto's transformation follows without complication. The action is signaled and participates in the turn, but could be swapped for another calming gesture (a sung note, a drawn symbol) with minor edits. Meets setup, development, and closure gates but lacks specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Through the patterns in a sand mandala is signaled early ("She worked through the patterns in a sand mandala"), the mechanics appear in the middle ("intricate lines in the fine gray sand," "adjusted a spiral," tile placed "at the mandala's heart"), and the method is present at closure when she scatters it and reflects on the pattern that led to hush. The mandala's visual form maps whispers and provides the structure for the emergent hush, making it causally active across three beats. Scattering it embodies acceptance of impermanence, adding conceptual cost. Specific and irreplaceable: the method shapes her approach and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whispering grotto in mist is established in the opening line, maintained throughout with sensory detail (cool stone, damp air, lilac unease, thinning mist at the end), and provides the ambient pressure (whispers) that Elara addresses. The setting supplies the problem and the atmosphere, and its transformation (whispers dissolving, mist softening) marks closure. However, the grotto does not constrain her choices or alter her tactics—she could perform the same ritual in any resonant space. The mist and stone are postcard description rather than micro-setting levers that force decisions. Meets all three gates but lacks causal pressure on protagonist action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>During the unlearning is mentioned twice ("During the unlearning, when old truths were deliberately forgotten" and "The unlearning, she realized, was not about loss"). The frame is abstract and does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or impose a deadline. Elara's actions unfold at leisure with no clock pressure. The timeframe flavors the setting but does not shape tactics or create urgency. Missing middle development and closure participation as a functional constraint; ornamental worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To discover meaning in the mess is stated early ("she had come here to discover meaning in the mess") and echoed at closure ("She had come seeking meaning, and found it in the orchestration of silence from noise"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Elara encounters no friction between this want and any cost, fear, or competing need. The motivation frames her presence but does not create on-page struggle or trade-off. Functional but replaceable; any contemplative goal would serve equally well.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lilac unease is named early ("The air carried a lilac unease"), recurs mid-story ("The lilac unease deepened momentarily"), and resolves at the end ("the lilac unease had bled into a contented, gray tranquility"). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image by transforming into tranquility, meeting all three gates. However, "lilac" as a color-label for dread is asserted rather than embodied through sensory detail or character perception, and the shift to "gray tranquility" is told rather than enacted through rhythm or diction change. Coherent but not fully integrated into prose texture.</comment>
