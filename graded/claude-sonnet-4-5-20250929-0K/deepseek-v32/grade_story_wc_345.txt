<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The collective "we" POV provides stable focalization but lacks individual embodied contradiction under pressure. Mara emerges briefly as a distinct character through the bell-ringing action, but her interior remains opaque. The ghost's "altruistic" motivation is asserted through summary rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices, and the community's shift from doubt ("reexamine our reliance") to clarity feels told rather than earned through on-page friction. Emotional progression relies on broad strokes—"hope," "doubt," "gratitude"—without the specific contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Arbos, orchard, floating arches, "we" collective) arrive within the first 100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (chalk messages, butterflies, arches, nebula) and the final callback to "writing new words" reconfigures the opening's passive reception into active stewardship. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the community becomes the ghost's successor) with conceptual cost visible in "The ghost, we believe, rests in that nebula." However, the middle section summarizes seasons of labor ("we worked...tending the butterflies, repairing irrigation") rather than dramatizing a single meaningful tightening, and the causal chain relies on obedience to off-stage guidance rather than protagonist decisions that narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, butterfly garden, and watering bell provide vivid, purposeful anchors that constrain the group's movement and choices. Sensory detail is selective—"bronze surface etched with wings," "mossy sides," "shimmering nebula visible only at this hour"—and filtered through collective perception. The arches function as micro-setting, shaping the climactic discovery ("From the summit, we saw the pattern"). Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (sidewalk, garden, arch summit). However, the orchard itself lacks tactile engagement beyond backdrop, and the nebula remains a visual symbol rather than an environmental constraint that pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival through orchestrated collective effort—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the messages "began to fade," forcing the community to "reexamine our reliance" and discover self-sufficiency. Agency reads as attention and endurance that forecloses dependency with conceptual cost ("You are the gardeners now"). However, the escalation occurs mostly in summary ("seasons of scarcity and bloom," "Years later") rather than through on-page reversals, and the ghost's guidance removes protagonist decision-making from key turns—Mara rings the bell, but the choice to obey is frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the arc from passive reception to active stewardship, and the watering bell shifts from instruction-object to "symbol of stewardship." The final image of writing messages for new arrivals offers a resonant answer to the question of dependency versus self-reliance. Subtext operates in the ghost's fading chalk and the phrase "respite is earned, not given." However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement—"collective effort blossoms from shared hope, no matter how brambled"—and "Its strangely trustworthy presence had faded, but its lesson remained" reads as overt summary. The thematic question is somewhat diluted by the ease with which the community accepts and follows the ghost's guidance without dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective focalization without head-hopping into individuated interiorities; the group's perceptual stance is consistent. Diction is purposeful and largely controlled—"tapestry of gnarled fruit trees," "pale, crumbling words," "brambled hope"—with vocabulary fitting the reflective, slightly elevated register. The narrative modulates appropriately from scarcity to revelation to legacy. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias (the collective "we" notices in uniform ways), and some phrasing tilts toward abstraction ("altruistic spirit part of the light") rather than concrete perception under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("The bell's tone sustains...") is functional but mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is generally high, with lines advancing image and plot. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ghost was strangely trustworthy, its advice always leading to bounty or shelter" restates the prior sentence's trust claim, and "Its strangely trustworthy presence had faded, but its lesson remained" echoes the earlier "strangely trustworthy" without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third: "We explained...we spoke...we believe" across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphor—"brambled...tangled with the thorns"—appears without fresh vehicle. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality at closure, so the penalty remains in Q7 only (−0.8 baseline for paraphrase + template + stock metaphor).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of altruistic ghost + collective survival + celestial reward engages familiar post-migration/utopian-commune templates without sharp transformation. The butterfly extinction-revival and floating-arch gateway offer surface novelty, yet the emotional arc—strangers learning to trust and become self-sufficient through a benevolent guide—follows a well-worn structure. Specificity in the watering bell's mechanics and the nebula's visibility window provides some freshness, but the core premise does not resist or complicate genre expectations. The final turn (community becomes the new guide) is earned in hindsight but not non-obvious. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice heightens stakes beyond the default.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost is present from the opening and drives the community's actions through chalk messages, appearing in setup, middle guidance, and final message ("You are the gardeners now"). However, the ghost's choices are off-stage and summarized; it never makes an on-page decision that alters tactics under pressure. The group obeys without friction, so the ghost's agency does not create key reversals—it enables rather than complicates. The element is functional but largely ornamental to protagonist decision-making, and the cost (the ghost's fading) is asserted rather than shown constraining a choice. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is indirect. Swappability is moderate (any benevolent guide could serve). Band ~4.0–4.9: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The watering bell appears early (garden visit), is used on-page by Mara (ringing at dusk releases butterflies and activates the gateway), recurs in the middle ("ringing the bell each dusk"), and returns in the ending as "symbol of stewardship...now polished and bright." It constrains the group's ritual and charges the closure image by linking daily care to the nebula promise. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate (the bell's tone sustains the gateway); closure linkage strong. Specificity high (bronze, etched wings). A visible cost is implied (the labor of maintenance) but not dramatized on the page. Band ~7.0–8.4: essential across beats and ending, though the bell does not independently narrow a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced early ("shimmering nebula visible only at this hour"), reappears in the middle as motivation ("the nebula will offer rest"), and recurs in the ending ("the nebula above gleamed brighter, a promise of peace earned through labor"). It shapes the dominant stake (earning celestial haven) and constrains the group's effort. Three gates met. However, the nebula remains abstract—a visual reward rather than a force that alters tactics on the page. The concept is present throughout but does not drive a specific middle turn or closure choice; it functions more as thematic backdrop than causal pressure. Band ~5.0–6.9: shapes one key turn (the arch-summit revelation) but does not independently force a costly decision at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute "strangely trustworthy" is mentioned twice ("The ghost was strangely trustworthy" and "Its strangely trustworthy presence had faded") and motivates the community's obedience. Setup gate met; the trait enables the group's actions but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—there is no on-page moment where trustworthiness is tested or fails. The attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory behavior under pressure. Swappability moderate (any positive trait could justify obedience). Band ~4.0–4.9: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears three times: the ghost's command ("reexamine the eastern arch"), the community's doubt ("We reexamined our reliance"), and the legacy ("at every dawn, we reexamine our path"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development strong (the second use forces the thematic turn from dependency to autonomy). The action drives the arc-summit discovery and the self-sufficiency shift, two key beats. However, the first use is obedience to instruction rather than protagonist-initiated inquiry, and the final use is metaphorical recap. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Band ~7.0: essential across beats, though the action could be swapped for "reconsider" or "reflect" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Chalked messages on sidewalks appear early ("messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks"), recur in the middle ("chalk scrawl commanded"), drive the group's tactics, and return in the ending ("we showed them the chalked sidewalks, now bearing our own messages"). Three gates met. The method shapes the community's orchestration and constrains their ritual (awaiting dawn messages). Specificity moderate ("pale, crumbling words"). However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure—no moment where the method fails or the group must act without it—and the cost of adopting it is not dramatized. Band ~6.0–6.9: shapes one key turn (the transition to self-guidance) and contributes to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is introduced in the opening and anchors all action. The arches supply the gateway discovery ("the arches formed a gateway, aligned with a shimmering nebula") and constrain the group's movement (climbing). Setup and middle-development gates met; closure linkage moderate ("its arches stable"). However, the setting does not independently alter a tactic or force a choice with cost—the arches are backdrop and revelation-stage rather than active constraint. The orchard's fruit trees and soil are mentioned but not engaged. Band ~5.0–6.9: shapes one key turn (the summit view) but remains somewhat ornamental to protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" is stated in the opening and recurs implicitly ("Years later, when new strangers arrived"). It frames the community's bond but does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline pressures tactics on the page. The passage of "seasons" and "Years later" is summarized without causal consequence. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation weak (time does not narrow options or charge the final image). Band ~4.0–4.9: functional context but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is present throughout: the ghost's guidance, the community's labor, and the final legacy of teaching newcomers. Setup and payoff gates met. The desire is dramatized in the group's coordinated tasks (ringing the bell, tending the garden) and tested in the doubt phase ("We reexamined our reliance"). However, the motivation is collective and abstract, lacking individual friction or conflicting wants. The cost (dependency → autonomy shift) is conceptual rather than felt in a specific choice. Band ~5.0–6.9: shapes one key turn but without on-page friction between competing desires.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone coherent throughout: "hope here was brambled, tangled with the thorns of past failures," "doubt crept in," "gratitude," and the final image of earned peace. The brambled-hope duality modulates with pressure (scarcity → revelation → doubt → clarity) and charges the closure ("respite is woven from daily care"). Setup, middle, and payoff gates met. Specificity strong ("brambled," "tangled with thorns"). However, the tone occasionally flattens into abstraction ("altruistic spirit part of the light") rather than maintaining the visceral bramble texture under stress. Band ~6.0–6.9: shapes tone across beats and contributes to the final image.</comment>
