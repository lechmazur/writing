<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's dual allegiance is stated clearly and his worry over the foundation stone chip recurs, but internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—it alternates between committee practicality and carnival loyalty across paragraphs. The grain-barge speech ("Our allegiance is to each other") reads as diagnostic summary rather than a choice under contradictory pressure. Elara's question and Kael's answer feel like exposition delivery rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path. The "orderly intuitive" label appears but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal thread: Kael encodes meetings, gathers the crew, proposes reorganization, they execute it. However, the climax—the grain-barge meeting and the proposal—is told rather than dramatized as a choice under immediate opposition. The final paragraph offers Charged Poise ("perhaps the carnival could remain afloat in spirit"), but the cost is asserted ("desperate hope") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful tightening is present (the buyout countdown), but the closure image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vivid and specific: frying dough, game wheels, woven flags, lanterns in the barge hold. Spatial choreography is clear (stern enclave, old grain barge). The foundation stone chip functions as a recurring micro-object that anchors memory and charges the final image, satisfying the constraint-or-charge test for 9-band eligibility. However, the environment does not alter a tactic or narrow a choice during the peak beat; the barge is a meeting location, not a pressure point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving carnival culture through privatization—is signaled early and sustained. The encoded graffiti and the grain-barge meeting constitute a tightening, but Kael's plan unfolds without on-page opposition or reversal. The "following days were a whirlwind" compresses all execution into summary, eliminating dramatized resistance or visible cost. The final image presents hope and adaptation, but no path is foreclosed with felt price; the outcome remains abstract ("perhaps").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—adaptation versus erasure, memory as anchor—emerges from the foundation stone chip and the graffiti network rather than overt statement. The chip's recurrence shifts from personal talisman to collective token, a purposeful escalation. However, the grain-barge speech edges into thematic summary ("This is a piece of our first raft… Our allegiance is to each other"), and the closing lines assert rather than enact resonance. The final image ("desperate hope that was now their collective sail") leans metaphoric but does not reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual signature is consistent—orderly cataloging (opening carnival details), worry (fingers on the stone chip), and split duty threading through paragraphs. Dialogue in the grain-barge scene feels functional but slightly expository ("We scatter like fish. How do we hold together?"). Register remains appropriate. The phrase "orderly intuitive" in the opening reads like a label imposed from outside rather than emerging from Kael's own thought texture, but the slip is brief and does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive. The opening paragraph showcases strong rhythm and specificity. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He believed in the carnival's chaotic spirit, yet he also served…" restates "His dual allegiance tore at him daily" without added pressure. The phrase "The tone of his days was one of hopeful desperation" is authorial summary rather than embodied perception. The final two paragraphs compress key action ("The following days were a whirlwind") into scaffolding summary when dramatization was warranted. Template-cadence runs are minimal; filter verbs are sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carnival-on-raft and encoded-graffiti premise is specific and fresh. The foundation stone chip as communal anchor offers a concrete inflection on memory-as-resistance. However, the central conflict—community organizing against gentrification—follows a familiar template, and the resolution ("quiet reorganization," "perhaps the carnival could remain afloat") avoids bold risk. The graffiti network is mentioned but not shown shaping a tactical choice under pressure, so the conceptual promise dilutes into convenience. Transformation is present but partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his role as "culture shock absorber" frames his function. However, his key choices—encoding graffiti, convening the barge meeting, proposing reorganization—are summarized rather than dramatized as decisions under immediate pressure. The grain-barge proposal scene shows him speaking, but no on-page opposition forces a tactical pivot. He observes and plans more than he decides with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in paragraph 1 (pocket worry), paragraph 4 (placed on crate during speech), paragraph 6 (passed among work crews), and paragraph 7 (clutched at closure). It shifts from personal talisman to collective token, a purposeful escalation. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as thematic anchor rather than plot lever. The reprise at closure reweights meaning but does not articulate a felt cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is stated explicitly ("He believed in the carnival's chaotic spirit, yet he also served on the liaison committee") and motivates Kael's split activity—advising developers while fortifying the carnival. It shapes the dominant stake. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a choice beat. The grain-barge scene presents one side (carnival loyalty) without on-page friction from the developer relationship.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears as a label in the opening and closing paragraphs ("His orderly nature had plotted every step, but his intuition screamed that time was slipping away"). It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff. The graffiti encoding and meeting logistics are described as products of this trait, but no scene shows orderliness limiting spontaneity or intuition overriding a plan with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is the verb driving Kael's plan: "We must reorganize not just our place, but our voice," and the text describes redistribution of spaces, documentation of games, and united presentation. The action is central to the scheme. However, the reorganization occurs in summary ("The following days were a whirlwind") rather than in dramatized beats, so its mechanics and immediate obstacles remain abstract. The final outcome hinges on it, but the dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Graffiti encoding is introduced in paragraph 2, demonstrated in paragraph 3 (the merry-go-round mural with hidden arrows), and recurs in paragraph 6 ("Kael's graffiti bloomed with new complexity"). The method is specific and repeated. However, no scene shows the encoding process under pressure or a recipient deciphering it to alter a tactic. It functions as infrastructure rather than an active plot lever that shapes a turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The raft city and carnival setting are vivid and sustained: opening sensory catalog, corporate enclave on the stern, old grain barge hold with lanterns, carnival music throughout. The setting frames the stakes (privatization threatens carnival culture). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome during peak beats. The barge is a meeting location; the carnival's soundscape is atmospheric but not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Before privatization was complete" opens the story, and Kael's speech notes "The buyout is weeks away." Time tightens motivation and justifies urgency. However, the countdown does not visibly narrow options or accelerate a choice in dramatized beats. The "following days" summary compresses the interval, and the final scene ("eve of the final negotiations") arrives without on-page clock pressure forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Navigate gentrification" is Kael's explicit goal, dramatized through the graffiti network, barge meeting, and reorganization plan. The motivation is clear and sustained. Friction between preserving culture and accepting practical upgrades is stated ("his dual allegiance tore at him"), but the contradiction does not force a visible cost or renunciation in a choice beat. The navigation succeeds in summary, sidestepping dramatized conflict between wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named in paragraph 2 and recurs ("brittle optimism," "desperate hope," final "desperate hope that was now their collective sail"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: urgency at the opening, resolve at the barge, charged poise at closure. However, the final image asserts the tone ("desperate hope") rather than embodying it through a specific action or image that makes the emotional cost undeniable without the label.</comment>
