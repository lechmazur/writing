<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is signaled clearly (to photograph the last bloom), but her interior life consists largely of abstract reflections rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The piece tells us she is "purposefully curious" without dramatizing cognitive trade-offs or micro-choices that foreclose options. Emotions are labeled ("dawnlit melancholy," "pang of sorrow") instead of shown through specific perceptual distortion or bodily response. The final choice—packing up after the mission succeeds—lacks visible cost or internal friction that would earn the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines and pursues a single dominant stake (capturing the last bloom before dawn). Closure registers as a Decisive Change (mission complete, era ended), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page: "dawnlit melancholy" is told, not felt through a visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The causal lens is signaled but weakens when the chemical vial "suddenly fizzed" without prior tension or complication—success arrives on schedule rather than being earned through a tightening choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and lunar setting are described with vivid particulars ("craters stretching into the shadows," "gold along the eastern rim") and the chemical vial and camera function as tools that constrain Aris's tactics. The hourglass sand grain remains decorative—handled across multiple beats but never altering a choice or shaping the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting's role in pressuring the protagonist (oxygen levels, sunrise clock) is present but underutilized at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is established early and held throughout. The story includes a tightening element (oxygen countdown, dawn approaching) but no on-page reversal or complication tests Aris's commitment—she succeeds as planned. The chemical vial's activation is a scheduled event, not a protagonist-driven turn that narrows options. Cost at closure is labeled ("pang of sorrow," "era ended") rather than shown through a visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (preservation versus loss, time's passage) emerges through image and action rather than direct statement, and the final paragraph attempts resonance via the grain of sand and "dawnlit melancholy." However, the ending drifts into summary and moralizing ("Her story, like the timed message, would endure") rather than letting the final image reweight prior material without explanation. The hourglass motif appears frequently but is ornamental—it does not constrain a choice or charge the closure with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and matches the character's technical role, though certain phrases ("dawnlit melancholy," "dawning hush") repeat as stock descriptors rather than evolving with pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Aris notices what the plot requires without a character-specific filter. The prose is clear and legible, but under peak stress (the bloom forming, vial reacting) the narrative distance does not tighten or modulate to heighten urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean, but paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy accumulate: "dawning hush" is defined three times, "grain of sand" is re-described across multiple beats without advancing knowledge, and several lines restate emotional state ("melancholy," "sorrow," "bittersweet") in adjacent passages. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She packed… She kept… And so…" The chemical-vial beat ("suddenly fizzed") lacks propulsion—information arrives in a summary rather than through concrete action. Figurative language ("craters… like ancient memories," "pulse with history") is present but does not overburden peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The moonlit-summit/last-bloom premise is atmospheric but familiar, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious character conflict or world logic. The chemical timed-message method is specific but introduced late and used only once without complication. Emotional beats (solitary mission, bittersweet preservation) follow a predictable arc with no fresh inflection or risk-taking structural choice. The hourglass sand grain and "space age" framing are generic anchors that could apply to many similar stories.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris is on the page throughout and her role frames the mission, but her choices do not create turns—she executes a pre-set plan (adjust camera, check oxygen, place vial) without complication. The final act (packing up, descending) is post-success reflection rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup and ending but functions as observer more than agent of change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sand grain appears in five distinct beats (hand, palm pulse, warmth, token of time's march, carried close) and is mentioned in the final image, but its role is purely symbolic—it does not enable or constrain a single on-page action. Aris never uses it, trades it, or makes a choice because of it. Swappable with any other keepsake without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is named and described in three beats, framing the atmosphere and clock pressure (sunrise approaching). It shapes the stakes (must outlast the hush to capture the bloom) and modulates with the arrival of light. However, it remains atmospheric rather than altering a tactic or forcing a choice; Aris waits for it rather than wrestling with it. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal role is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is labeled twice and linked to examining crevices, but no on-page action demonstrates a trade-off or cost driven by this trait. Aris's curiosity does not conflict with caution, time pressure, or mission focus—she investigates and succeeds without friction. Label-only presence without visible constraint or enabling moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Outlast" drives the mission frame (outlast darkness, outlast the night) and the oxygen/time clock. It appears in three beats and is named in the closure paragraph ("outlasting oblivion"). The final success hinges on endurance, but the story never dramatizes a moment where outlasting nearly fails or forces a sacrifice. Essential to stakes but not to a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The chemical-reaction method is explained at ~30% and placed on-page in one beat mid-story, then activated at the climax. It does not shape earlier attempts or force a tactical adjustment—Aris sets it once and it works as planned. Functional and specific but introduced too late to pressure middle choices. Present in setup (explanation), middle (placement), and ending (activation), reaching two-of-three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The moonlit summit anchors the entire scene, provides the visual stakes (craters, horizon, gold rim), and imposes constraints (oxygen, lunar sunrise clock). It is named and used across all three acts. However, at closure the summit becomes backdrop—Aris descends without the environment altering her final choice or charging the image. Strong setup and middle development, but closure participation is thin.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Space age" is named three times as historical context but does not tighten a decision or create urgency. The time period could be swapped for any era of lunar exploration without structural change. Mentioned but not causally active; no tactics or choices depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation (photograph the last bloom before extinction) is stated early, repeated across beats, and fulfilled at closure. It drives the mission and underlies the emotional stakes. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—Aris does not face a trade-off between photographing and another cost or temptation. Present throughout and resolved, but lacks friction that would lift it into the higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is named explicitly and used to describe emotional state in three beats. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (heavy hush → lifting glow → stark light / lingering melancholy), but it remains asserted rather than embodied through perceptual distortion or action. It charges the ending image weakly—told rather than shown. Functional across the arc but not indispensable.</comment>
