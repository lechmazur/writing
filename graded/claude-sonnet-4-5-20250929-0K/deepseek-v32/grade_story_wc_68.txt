<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal state is filtered through elevated philosophical register throughout, which reads as consistent voice rather than character-particular embodiment. The decision to venture deeper and place the cog is motivated by prior setup, but the "tectonic pressure of decision" and "agonized truly" tell rather than dramatize contradictory impulses. The scouts provide external pressure but remain flat; their awe dissolves without visible cost or complication. Minor deduction for diagnostic phrasing ("abrasive calm," "rational rebel") used as labels rather than shown through micro-choices under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred: retrieval of the cog → agonized decision → journey to archive → placement → projection of cycles → scouts witness = Decisive Change with felt cost (she must now integrate rather than preserve in isolation). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure lands on the page with cost legible in the final line: "a slower, deeper agony than mere defiance." One meaningful tightening occurs when the scouts force her hand, and the machine's validation reconfigures her stance from private study to public inheritance. Minor penalty for the phrase "competing narratives resolved in silent, luminous fact," which tells the thematic outcome rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken city's "bone-white ribs," "sedimentary layers," and the archive's "crystalline lattices and brass mechanisms" are vivid and purposeful. The chronometer cog constrains the final choice—its absence in the console is the hinge. Spatial choreography through vertical crawl (newer rubble → older stone → original foundations) remains clear. Minor deduction: the "dry pocket in the masonry" and "circular chamber" are sketched but not pressured; we don't feel temperature, air quality, or bodily cost of the descent that would sharpen the ordeal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. erasure) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the scouts' arrival forces Elara from contemplation to proof. The journey and placement narrow options and the final image shows visible cost: she must now collaborate. Agency is clear in the placement of the cog. Minor deduction: the scouts' conversion to "wordless awe" deflates too easily without friction or secondary consequence; the ending asserts "just beginning" rather than showing a concrete next move or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (precision vs. simplicity, memory vs. erasure) emerges from the cog, the archive, and Elara's stance without overt moralizing. The projection of interlocking cycles offers a non-literal answer. The phrase "competing narratives resolved in silent, luminous fact" edges toward thematic summary but the image itself does the work. The cog recurs with shifted meaning (artifact → key → proof). Minor slip: "rational rebel" and "abrasive calm" are prompt-adjacent labels that the prose asserts rather than fully dramatizing through conflicted micro-choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Diction is elevated and internally consistent ("wannabe philosopher," "sedimentary layers of time," "tectonic pressure"). The phrase "abrasive calm" is told twice rather than embodied in perception or syntax. Dialogue from the scout is functional and goal-driven but brief. Minor penalty for filter stacks and abstract phrasing in peak beats: "agonized over its meaning, not with emotional flailing, but with a slow, grinding pressure of the mind" tells method rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. Perceptual signature leans philosophical-generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no major loops or pronoun drift. Sentence openings vary. Minor artifacts: "Her motivation was singular" (summary), "agonized over its meaning, not with emotional flailing, but" (scaffold negation), "competing narratives resolved" (summary), and the repeated label "abrasive calm" across three beats without evolving embodiment. Figurative density ("tectonic pressure," "sedimentary layers," "bone-white ribs") is purposeful but the phrases trend toward stock metaphor in the descent sequence. No paraphrase loops, but template cadence appears in the transition from cog description to "Days passed in measured contemplation."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (philosopher-archaeologist in sunken sewer, ancient machine unlocked by found cog) synthesizes familiar elements but lacks a sharp, non-obvious turn. The cog-as-key beat is foreshadowed cleanly yet reads as mild convenience (perfect fit discovered off-page). Emotional truth is present in Elara's isolation and the scouts' shift, but the resolution (awe → inheritance) trends toward expected uplift. The world detail (Master Models, tidal/agricultural/stellar cycles) adds texture without fully transforming the underlying template. No close echoes of famous lines, but the arc (lone scholar vindicates lost knowledge) follows a well-worn path without sufficient specificity to charge originality into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat: retrieves cog, agonizes, confronts scouts, descends, places cog, returns. Her choices create the key turns (decision to prove, placement). Setup early, development in the confrontation and descent, payoff in placement and return. Causal pressure clear. Cost visible: she must now integrate knowledge rather than hoard it. "Wannabe philosopher" status shapes her stance. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seafarer's chronometer cog is discovered (beat 1), set on shelf (beat 2), carried into archive (beat 3), and placed into console void (beat 4—closure hinge). Early signal, recurring across four beats, irreplaceable (its shape unlocks the machine), and decisively shapes the ending. Cost tied to it: she gambles her theory on this single object. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Competing narratives (ancients as decadent fools vs. precise cycle-masters) frame Elara's stake and appear in her agonizing and the final projection. Setup paragraph two, development in her agonizing paragraph, payoff when the projection "resolved" the contest. It shapes her motive and the thematic question. Moderate causal pressure; the resolution is asserted ("resolved in silent, luminous fact") rather than shown through a visible trade-off. Present across beats but mostly thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is labeled twice ("rationally rebellious," "relentless scrutiny," "abrasive calm") but the trait is shown in her refusal to leave and her measured confrontation with the scout. Setup early, mild constraint (she will not flee or rage), payoff in her calm return and gesture. It does not force a visible trade-off or narrow options in the descent. Functional but somewhat ornamental; "abrasive calm" does similar work and dominates the tone cue.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears three times: over the cog's meaning (beat 1), "agonized truly" at the scouts' ultimatum (beat 2—turns her to action), and "slower, deeper agony" in closure. Setup early, development forces the journey, payoff reweights her future task. The term is specific and recurring, though the second use is summary ("agonized truly") rather than dramatized. Strong integration with minor summary slip.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is signaled in paragraph one ("sedimentary layers of time"), enacted in the descent ("newer rubble, then older, denser stone, then the original, elegant foundations"), and implicit in the archive's depth. The method shapes her journey and the payoff (the archive is found precisely because she reads strata). Setup early, development in the descent choreography, payoff in discovery. Causal and irreplaceable. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins anchor every beat: dry pocket, sewer conduit, bone-white ribs, vertical crawl, circular archive chamber. Early setup, development through spatial descent, payoff when the archive's location validates her preservation theory. The setting supplies the cog, the archive, and the tactical constraint (she must go deeper). The ruins are indispensable to logic and closure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" is stated in paragraph one and sets the rebuilding urgency that motivates the scouts' sealing order. It frames the world's rush versus Elara's preservation. Development: the scouts arrive "days" later. The timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; no live clock. It shapes context and motive but does not alter tactics on the page. Functional context, moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve ancient methods" drives every choice: she lives in the sewer to study, retrieves the cog, refuses to leave, descends to find the archive, and places the cog to prove her theory. Setup paragraph one, development in confrontation and descent, payoff in the projection and her recognition that preservation now requires integration. Causal pressure across all beats, cost visible (solitary study ends). Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is labeled in the opening, the confrontation ("her tone flat, abrasive in its lack of accommodating warmth"), and the ending ("all abrasive calm"). It modulates slightly (gains "an edge, like the cog's teeth") under pressure and charges the final gesture (she points without speaking). Setup early, development under stress, payoff in the silent gesture. The tone is asserted more than embodied in syntax or rhythm, limiting its integration; the label recurs but the prose does not distinctly enact the friction. Moderate integration with lyric reprise.</comment>
