<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arvid's motivation to decode the stranger's gesture is credibly rooted in his role as keeper and observer, and the borrowed-memory device creates a distinct interior texture. His progression from tactile observation to visceral shock to mournful stream shows embodied emotion and agency under pressure. The final knowledge claim—Emil's name and backstory—feels unmotivated by on-page causality; the visions provide emotional texture but not the level of biographical detail Arvid reports. The ending forecloses Arvid's isolation with visible cost (transition from witness to keeper of story), satisfying the length requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with causal strands (body discovery → investigation → borrowed memories → final insight). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Arvid moves from witnessed isolation to keeper of story, and the final image reweights prior material ("no longer just a witness"). However, the cost is primarily conceptual—Arvid's serene certainty and the constable's acceptance—rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The biographical details (name, origin, trade) emerge without clear causal link to the visions shown, creating a minor motivational gap that slightly undercuts closure credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The opal dock with its "milky, iridescent planks" and the mist as "softly persistent veil" create vivid sensory anchors filtered through Arvid's contemplative perspective. The setting constrains investigation (fog delays constable, cool storeroom becomes mortuary) and the dock's glow charges both opening and closing beats. Spatial choreography is clean, the nautical-twilight time frame is held, and the contrast between alpine Edelweiss and wet coastal environment sharpens thematic resonance. The environment actively shapes Arvid's method and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early and drives Arvid's investigation. The pressure tightens through three beats: tactile study (gaps, calloused hands, no ID), visceral borrowed-memory shock, and the mournful stream at the dock that yields Emil's story. Arvid's agency is present (he chooses to touch the flower twice, to investigate by observing gaps), and the final act alters his stance from isolated observer to story-keeper. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal, fitting the inferred Hybrid lens. Cost is felt but not materially traded; Arvid gains knowledge and a bridge across isolation without visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars—witnessed isolation, the mountain flower on a coastal body, the gaps that speak louder than facts—without overt statement. The Edelweiss functions as a vessel for fidelity and memory, and its transformation from brittle relic to conduit for "borrowed memories" reweights the premise. The final image ("no longer just a witness…but a keeper of a story that had…bridged the deepest gap of all") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of connection across isolation and death. No moralizing; the ending invites reflection through the concreteness of dawn burning away mist and the opal dock struck to fire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Arvid's perceptual signature: "gaps…absences and silences that often spoke louder than facts," the taxonomy of calloused hands, the taste of alpine frost. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the borrowed-memory beats, slightly distanced during the constable's arrival). Diction remains consistent—measured, slightly formal, fitting an eccentric keeper—and the prose rhythm slows for contemplation, quickens for visceral shock. The constable's brief dialogue feels natural. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Arvid experiences, though the final biographical leap (name, trade, origin) stretches POV modesty slightly without breaking it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; the opening builds atmosphere through layered clauses, the borrowed-memory beats compress into sharp fragments ("A sudden, visceral shock…"), and the closing paragraph breathes with longer constructions. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the investigation paragraph ("He had the body brought…The man carried…The clothing…") and a few filter verbs ("He felt the wrench," "He saw a steep valley") slightly dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout. The final image recharges the opal dock and mist with new meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core premise—borrowed memories via a pressed flower—offers a fresh inflection on the drowned-stranger mystery. The combination of lighthouse-keeper isolation, alpine Edelweiss, and psychometric touch feels specific rather than templated. However, the "eccentric loner gains supernatural insight" frame is familiar, and the emotional arc (isolated observer → empathetic bridge) follows a recognizable trajectory. The execution is confident and the synthesis of elements feels organic, but the piece does not take structural or moral risks that would elevate it into the high 8s. Transformation of the trope is present but moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arvid's role as lighthouse keeper frames his isolation and method ("observing gaps"), and his choices—bringing the body to the storeroom, touching the flower twice, meeting the constable with serene certainty—create key turns. His eccentricity is demonstrated through his supernatural receptiveness and calm authority at the end. The character is present in all three acts (discovery, investigation, resolution) and his decisions drive escalation and closure. Not indispensable—a different solitary role could serve—but his keeper identity charges the "witnessed isolation" motif and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss appears in four distinct beats: pinned to the stranger's coat (discovery), studied in the kitchen (first tactile shock), held at the dock (mournful stream vision), and implicitly present when Arvid offers Emil's story to the constable. Its transformation from "curious ornament" to vessel of borrowed memories to emblem of fidelity drives escalation and closure. The object's specific properties—dried, alpine, buttonhole flower—matter causally; a generic token would not carry the mountain/coast contrast or the sacramental weight. Removal would collapse the supernatural investigation and the thematic bridge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Borrowed memories appear on-page in two vivid beats: the visceral shock ("thin, cold air and a woman's laughter echoing off rock") and the mournful stream ("a steep valley, a wooden chalet, a promise made…the wrench of departure…green water loomed"). The concept shapes Arvid's method (touching the flower to access impressions), alters his tactics (returning to the dock for a second, controlled attempt), and enables the closure revelation. The mechanics are dramatized rather than told, and the cost is felt (Arvid's hammering heart, the taste of alpine frost). The concept is indispensable to the investigative arc and the final knowledge claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is applied to the mist in the opening and closing beats, creating a lyric frame. The attribute describes atmosphere and modulates with Arvid's emotional state (muffling the world at dusk, luminous in the dark, burning away at dawn). It does not constrain a specific on-page action or create a tradeoff, but it charges the final image and reinforces the "witnessed isolation" tone. Present in setup and payoff with purposeful recurrence, but not causally essential. The trait fits well without being irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Investigate" is signaled early ("He decided to investigate") and structures the middle: studying the body's gaps, touching the flower for borrowed memories, interpreting the visions. The action drives two key turns (tactile shock, mournful stream) and leads directly to the closure revelation. Arvid's method—observing gaps—gives the investigation specificity. Swapping "investigate" for "examine" or "decode" would require only minor edits, capping the score below 8.5, but the action is present across beats and shapes the ending's certainty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled in the second paragraph ("His method would be by observing gaps, the absences and silences…") and applied on-page: no identification, no ship reported, no one seeking him, the void itself. The method informs Arvid's initial investigation (calloused hands, good wool, profound gaps) and primes his receptiveness to the flower's impressions. It shapes his interpretive stance but does not mechanically constrain later beats; the borrowed-memory visions provide content the gap-method did not directly enable. Present in setup and development, with thematic resonance, but not indispensable to the closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The opal dock appears in the opening, middle (Arvid returns to hold the boutonnière), and closing (dawn strikes the opal to fire). Its "milky, iridescent planks" and glowing quality create a charged setting for both borrowed-memory beats and frame the story's beginning and end. The dock's proximity to the harbor and the barnacled legs supply the discovery context. The setting does not constrain a choice (Arvid could access memories elsewhere), but it charges the final image and reinforces the coastal/alpine contrast. Strong setup and payoff; solid beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"At nautical twilight" anchors the opening time frame and sets the liminal tone. The story's clock moves from dusk (body discovery) through night (investigation, borrowed memories) to dawn (constable's arrival, final image). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live countdown, but it tracks coherently and the progression from twilight to dawn mirrors Arvid's emotional arc (isolation to connection, mist to clarity). Present in setup and payoff with purposeful atmospheric weight, but not causally essential to escalation or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To decode a stranger's final gesture" is signaled early ("a compulsion he could not name, a motivation to decode this stranger's final gesture") and drives all three acts: bringing the body to the storeroom, studying gaps, touching the flower twice, offering the decoded story to the constable. The motivation is embodied (compulsion, visceral shock, mournful stream) and conflicted (Arvid's isolation versus the pull to understand). The friction between witnessed isolation and the compulsion to bridge the gap creates cost at closure. The desire is indispensable to escalation and the final stance shift.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is established in the second paragraph ("His isolation was not absolute; it was a witnessed isolation, observed from afar…") and modulates through the arc: broken by the body's arrival, deepened by the borrowed memories' intimacy, transformed at closure ("no longer just a witness to isolation, but a keeper of a story that had…bridged the deepest gap"). The tone is coherent—contemplative, elegiac, slightly formal—and charges the final image. The transformation from passive witness to active keeper reweights the premise. Strong thematic and tonal integration across beats and ending.</comment>
