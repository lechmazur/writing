<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clearly rooted and embodied through physical action (copying, aiming the radio), but his interior life remains largely declarative. The piece tells us about his "quiet fire" and goal rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final smile and "profound peace lined with quiet triumph" feel like emotional labels rather than embodied states with visible cost. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with friction; the protagonist moves smoothly from discovery to execution without genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first third. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image crystallizes Aris's clandestine broadcast as permanent and the famine "over, one story at a time." However, cost is asserted rather than made undeniable on the page—what did Aris forfeit, risk, or lose to reach this moment? The "thistled calm" and "profound peace" suggest emotional resolution without visible price, and the phrase "The famine was over" declares victory rather than showing a trade-off or constraint that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial's glow supply vivid sensory anchors and recur purposefully. The "secretly luminous" glow constrains Aris's final action (aiming the radio to teach dust), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is filtered through POV (the glow "visible only to him") and the mist functions as both atmosphere and practical shroud. However, the alcove itself remains largely scenic backdrop rather than a space that alters tactics or imposes material limits on his work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding narrative from silence—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pirate voice speaks directly to Aris, prompting him to aim the radio at dust. Yet escalation relies on coincidence (the broadcast arriving, the voice addressing him) rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. The resolution (dust dancing into shapes) is a discovery rather than a choice with visible cost; Aris does not sacrifice, renounce, or endure anything to achieve it, and no live option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of teaching dust to tell stories and the motif of cloaking truth within art. The recurring radio glow and dust imagery shift meaning at closure (from beacon to tool to archive), and the final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the line "The famine was over, one story at a time" edges toward thematic summary, and phrases like "their shared defiance against the famine's void" become slightly abstract rather than rooted in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct (Aris notices musical structure, coded lyrics, dust motes as potential). Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, fitting the world's post-famine reverence for narrative. Under peak moments the voice remains coherent and voice-motivated phrases like "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" recur with pattern. Minor filter-verb reliance ("seemed to tremble," "began to copy") slightly dulls immediacy in a few beats, but the overall rhythmic control and specificity support the textural accumulation without major slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("story famine," "thistled calm," "secretly luminous," "bridge made of sunlight") and mostly coherent, but several beats stack metaphor without advancing pressure: "a voice wrapped in a thistled calm" followed by "elusive, fragments of ballads" and "container for something else" within two sentences risks decorative layering. Paraphrase loop between "The method of the broadcast was via elusive song lyrics" and "He understood that the singer used the words to cloak vital information" (−0.2). Template cadence in several sentences ("He sought… He understood… He aimed…") creates mild rhythmic drag (−0.4). Information density is generally high, but a few lines recapitulate without added detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of copyist, pirate broadcast, and teaching dust through radio-glow is specific and non-obvious. The "story famine" premise and clandestine-art-as-resistance frame are familiar from dystopian templates, but the execution transforms them through the lyric particulars of dust choreography and embedded musical codes. Risk-taking in the textural/accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the emotional arc (solitary discovery → triumph) follows a well-worn path, and the resolution lacks the friction or moral calculus that would make it feel inevitable rather than satisfying.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris (diligent orchestra copyist) is present throughout and his occupation shapes his method (embedding responses in orchestral parts, copying lyrics as scores). His decision to aim the radio at dust is the story's key turn. However, many beats are observational (listening, leaning closer, realizing) rather than choice-driven. The copyist identity constrains method but does not visibly limit or cost him; it enables without friction. Present in setup, middle action, and closure; drives one key beat (aiming the radio) with moderate causal pressure; swappable with "archivist" or similar role with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, swappability −0.6, ornamental stretches −0.6 = mid-5s band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in at least four beats: initial search, intensifying to cast scripts, the pirate's direct address, and the final dust-teaching moment. Its "secretly luminous" property enables the climactic action (illuminating dust to coax stories). The glow shifts from beacon to tool to gentle teacher, reweighting meaning across the arc. Present in setup, development (multiple uses), and closure; drives two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the ending action) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (green glow, pulsing in time with transmissions) +0.6, early signal +0.6. Minor swappability (any light source could illuminate dust) −0.5 = low-7s band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast frames the story's stakes (rebuilding narrative) and supplies the coded lyrics Aris uses. It appears early, drives the middle sequence (Aris copying and responding), and its final cryptic verse ("ember nurturing a seed") echoes the alcove's mood at closure. However, the broadcast itself does not narrow Aris's options or impose cost; it arrives as gift rather than friction. Setup by end of first third +0.6, two beats (arrival, direct address) +0.9, closure participation (final verse, echo) +1.0, causal pressure (enables but does not constrain) +0.5, swappability (any clandestine transmission) −0.5, ornamental stretches (described more than used) −0.5 = mid-6s band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "secretly luminous" glow is established early and recurs across beats. It enables the key action (illuminating dust) and is specified as "visible only to him," which could impose a constraint (others cannot see it). However, that exclusivity never creates friction or cost on the page; no one challenges or misses the glow. The trait is label-adjacent ("secretly luminous scripts," "secretly luminous glow") without forcing a tactical trade-off. Setup early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (charges dust-teaching) +1.2, causal enablement +0.6, label-only in some mentions −0.5, no visible cost tied to the attribute −0.6 = low-5s band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cloak" as action recurs: the singer cloaks information in lyrics, Aris cloaks responses in orchestral parts, and "to cloak truth within art" is named as shared defiance. The method shapes tactics (embedding codes) and appears across setup, middle, and thematic closure. However, the act of cloaking never imposes visible cost or narrows options; it is protective rather than conflicted. No antagonist tests the disguise, so the action remains aspirational. Setup +0.6, two beats (singer's method, Aris's responses) +0.9, closure (thematic statement) +0.8, causal pressure (defines method) +0.7, swappability (encrypt, hide, encode) −0.6, summary-only in key beats −0.6 = mid-6s band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "via elusive song lyrics" is established early ("the singer used the words to cloak vital information") and Aris engages it by copying and embedding his own responses in musical phrases. The method appears in setup, middle (copying, embedding), and closure echo (the final cryptic verse). Its mechanics matter (lyrics as containers, cello lines as maps), but the exact mechanism is described more than tested under pressure. Setup +0.6, two beats (pirate's lyrics, Aris's embedding) +0.9, closure participation (final verse) +0.8, causal pressure +0.7, swappability (coded messages) −0.5, ornamental description −0.5 = high-5s band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove is described early with vivid detail (carved into hillside, perpetually misty, soft glow). The mist "thickened, a perfect shroud for his clandestine symphony," offering light tactical support. However, the alcove never constrains choice, imposes scarcity, or alters Aris's range of action; it is scenic container. The "ember" mood returns at closure ("dial's glow slowly faded to a soft ember, matching the alcove's mood"), a lyric reprise. Setup early +0.6, closure lyric reprise +0.7, ornamental (postcard description) −0.8, swappability (any hidden workspace) −0.7, no causal pressure −0.4 = mid-4s band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the story famine" anchors the world's premise and motivates Aris's mission. It appears in the opening phrase and is referenced at closure ("The famine was over"). However, the "after" is static backdrop rather than live clock; no urgency tightens decisions, and the famine's ongoing presence or end is declared rather than demonstrated through scarcity or cost. Setup +0.6, closure callback +0.5, no causal pressure (does not tighten tactics) −0.7, ornamental (worldbuilding flavor) −0.6, swappability (post-war, post-silence) −0.5 = low-3s band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is stated early ("his motivation… was to teach dust to tell stories once more") and dramatized in the climactic beat (aiming the radio, dust dancing into shapes). It drives Aris's nightly ritual and shapes his response to the pirate broadcast. However, the motivation is more aspiration than conflicted desire; no friction between this want and a competing fear or cost is shown. Setup early +0.7, two beats (nightly work, final dust-teaching) +0.9, closure linkage (dust shapes, final triumph) +1.3, causal pressure +0.8, told-only in opening −0.5, no visible friction or cost −0.9 = low-6s band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "thistled calm" is named twice ("a voice wrapped in a thistled calm," "the thistled calm of his misty refuge") and enacted through the story's serene pacing, soft imagery (mist, ember glow), and restrained emotional register. The calm modulates slightly with the radio's intensification but does not break under pressure. The final image ("profound peace lined with quiet triumph") sustains the tone and charges it with completion. Coherent throughout +0.8, closure charge (calm as victory) +1.0, static in middle (no modulation under discovery pressure) −0.6, label-adjacent phrasing ("thistled calm" repeated without new texture) −0.4 = mid-6s band.</comment>
