<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leila's interiority is concrete and her motivation—restoring faith in fractured lineage—drives micro-choices throughout (clearing moss, tracing glyphs, rebuilding the sundial's intent). "Warmly curious" is embodied in her solemn reverence and interpretive labor rather than fear. The final stance (seeing connection rather than staying) feels earned by the accumulated insight. Minor: internal contradiction could be sharper; the journey from fracture to integration proceeds smoothly without much on-page struggle or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (valley, orchard, catacomb) appear early; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered images (bones, roots, sundial, stars). Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image reweights her return as a "returned seed, momentarily resting" with the cost made legible—she leaves rather than stays, integrating interrupted journeys into an enduring pattern. One meaningful deepening (excavation → understanding cycles) is sufficient for this length. The because/therefore chain is light but the thematic cadence shift at closure compensates under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored (gnarled apple boughs, mossy ground, porous bone crust) and constrains Leila's choices: she kneels, clears channels for roots, positions the gnomon to catch noon light. The sundial base—stone disk, eroded glyphs, skeletal platform—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (shadow pointing to the valley, bones singing through trees). Sensory detail (hum of bees, thick air, dappled sunlight) is selective and purposeful. The orchard's dual nature (death/renewal) directly informs her realization at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost faith in lineage) is signaled early and tightens as Leila moves from excavation to interpretation to rebuilding intent. The deepening occurs when she recognizes the sundial as a map of cycles, not hours, reweighting her family's exodus as a necessary seeding. Agency is clear: she chooses to rebuild connection rather than structure, clearing channels and placing the gnomon. Cost is conceptual and felt—she leaves, integrating rather than possessing. One meaningful pressure point (interrupted journeys → deliberate pause) is sufficient under the accumulative lens, though a sharper mid-story complication would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (journeys as circles, exile as seeding, decay feeding renewal) emerges organically from the sundial's function, the bones nurturing trees, and Leila's parallel between ancestors' burial and her family's diaspora. The final image—"returned seed, momentarily resting in ancestral soil before her next necessary wandering"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "interrupted journeys" reweighted from tragedy to deliberate pause. The conceptual cost is legible: connection requires departure, not permanence. No thematic echo or late-breaking sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Leila's perceptual signature (tracing constellations, interpreting bones as seeding) is distinct and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity: "xylem and phloem," "ribcage cradled a thriving sapling," "momentarily resting in ancestral soil." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at key beats (kneeling, tracing glyphs, placing the gnomon). No head-hopping. Minor: some figurative density in the opening paragraphs ("deeper silence hummed," "thick with interrupted journeys") approaches overwriting but remains legible and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance discovery, interpretation, or thematic weight). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots snake between bones," "finger bones threaded through thicker roots like ivory beads"). Minor deduction: "interrupted journeys" recurs frequently across paragraphs in similar phrasing without always adding new pressure; the phrase risks becoming a motif token rather than evolving each time. Propulsion is steady; clarity remains strong at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—diaspora return, catacomb orchard, sundial as seasonal guide tied to ancestral bones—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "interrupted journeys" from tragedy to necessary pause in a renewal cycle offers fresh inflection. The emotional calculus (leaving to honor connection rather than staying to claim it) avoids the expected resolution. Risk: the lyric, reflective mode and lack of external antagonist or sharp mid-story complication keep the piece in thoughtful territory rather than urgent. The premise integrates well but doesn't take a bold structural or perspectival leap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leila (diaspora returnee) drives all key turns: she seeks the orchard, excavates the sundial, interprets the glyphs, rebuilds the intent, and chooses to leave. Her status as returnee shapes her motivation (restore faith in fractured lineage) and her final insight (diaspora as seeding). Present in setup, middle beats (clearing moss, tracing glyphs, placing gnomon), and closure (leaving as "returned seed"). High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sundial base appears early (central stone disk, eroded glyphs, missing gnomon), is handled across multiple beats (clearing moss, tracing constellations, placing branch into gnomon hole at noon), and charges the closure image (shadow falling along groove pointing to valley, measuring seasons not hours). The object's reweighted meaning (ancestors' intentional return feeding the orchard) directly enables Leila's final realization. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is signaled early (bones = paths cut short, her own fractured return) and reweighted at closure (not tragedies but necessary pauses in decay/renewal cycles; her family's flight as seeding). The concept shapes her interpretive stakes and the sundial's function (ancestors' journey into earth as intentional return). Present in setup, middle (recognizing deliberate pause), and closure (her departure as integrated interruption). Strong thematic and closure linkage; could score higher if it more visibly constrained a tactical choice mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is embodied in her solemn reverence replacing fear, her tracing of glyphs, and her interpretive patience. It enables her to proceed without dread and constrains her to rebuild intent rather than reassemble bones. Present in setup ("warmly curious gaze" of elder, her own affect) and middle beats. Moderate causal pressure; the trait could be swapped for "patient" or "reverent" with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability. Does not decisively shape closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the climactic action: she rebuilds the intent of the place (clearing channels for roots, placing the gnomon, allowing sunlight to strike the dial). This act redefines her understanding (connection over structure) and enables closure (leaving as a returned seed). Present in middle beats and directly shaping the ending. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Removing "rebuild" would require structural rewrite; "restore" or "repair" would not carry the same conceptual weight (intent vs. artifact).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled early (elder's advice: "proceed through purposeful wandering, letting the place guide her steps") and its mechanics appear in the excavation (clearing moss "not with a shovel, but with her hands," over days, "less like disinterment and more like careful listening"). The method shapes her interpretive process and is explicitly invoked at closure ("The purpose of her purposeful wandering clarified"). Present in setup, middle, and thematically at closure. Moderate causal pressure; could score higher if the wandering constrained a tactical choice more visibly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard (tree roots snake between bones, ribcage cradles sapling, finger bones thread through roots) is present throughout and supplies the core resources: bones as intentional seeding, roots as channels, sundial platform of skeletal remains. The setting pressures Leila's choices (kneeling, clearing channels, interpreting the dial's function) and charges the closure image (bones singing through xylem/phloem, apples sweetening). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, high causal pressure, and indispensable to closure. Removing the catacomb orchard collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" frames the timeframe (days of clearing moss and soil, work spanning excavation). Time is tracked loosely ("over days," "at the sun's zenith," "as the shadow lengthened," "first evening star appeared") and tightens slightly toward closure but does not create urgent pressure or alter tactics. Present in setup and middle; provides pacing but is not a live clock. Moderate integration; swappable with "during her stay" or "over several days" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to restore lost faith" is signaled early ("a need to restore lost faith in her own history, a lineage fractured by exodus"), drives all her choices (seeking the orchard, excavating, interpreting, rebuilding intent), and is explicitly resolved at closure ("The faith she restored was not in a place, but in the pattern itself"). The friction between wanting permanence and needing departure adds cost. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure; high causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is established early ("place of cautious enchantment, sunlight filtering through gnarled apple boughs") and modulates with pressure: reverence replaces fear, the air feels "thick with interrupted journeys," final tone shifts to cradle-like warmth. Tone coherence is strong; it charges the final image ("warm and curious as the living wood growing through bone"). Present throughout and shapes the reader's experience of the ending. High tonal control and closure linkage; slightly below indispensable because tone supports rather than drives plot turns.</comment>
