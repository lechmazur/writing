<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent—translating generational voices—and the music box discovery drives his final compositional act. Interiority is vivid ("positively wistful energy, not sad, but tenderly attuned to loss"), and the jar-filling actions embody his pursuit. However, the piece lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Arlo moves smoothly from collector to composer without struggle, and the final "gleaned redemption" feels declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (vagrant poet, dune loft, dawn). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the pattern of jar-filling, culminating in a cadence shift when the music box unlocks the "complete song." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Arlo commits to staying and translating, and the final image of jars singing back reweights his purpose. Cost is oblique: loneliness is reframed as purpose rather than paid with a visible forfeiture, which limits impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral loft is vivid and specific ("cavern of driftwood and stubborn memory," "sandy cathedral"), and sensory detail—wind hissing an A, mist veiling the sea—anchors reader comprehension. The music box functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (he must sweeten the gears to unlock it) and charging the final image when surrounded by jars. Dawn's timing and the loft's isolation shape Arlo's solitary ritual. One minor slip: "crate-table" and spatial choreography could be sharper when he arranges jars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: capturing the "most vital word" to complete his sound dictionary. The music box discovery and honey-thyme solution constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows Arlo's method and unlocks the shanty. Under the Accumulative lens, this shift deepens his role from collector to composer. However, no live opposition tests his commitment, and the resolution—mixing jars to "play conversations"—feels more like thematic declaration than a choice with visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory preservation as translation between generations—emerges organically from the jar method and music box payoff. The final image of jars singing back is non-literal and resonant, reweighting Arlo's loneliness as purpose. Yet the last two paragraphs veer toward summary and mild sermonizing ("gleaned redemption," "true currency…preserved time"), labeling rather than trusting the image. One micro slip: "positively wistful" reads diagnostic in context, though embodied enough to avoid larger penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, and Arlo's perceptual signature is distinct: "dawn's earliest whistle, that sharp, thin note of light," "lonesome splendor," vocabulary tied to his vagrant-poet identity. Diction remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Elision is purposeful (days compressed: "For days it sat…Then, on a morning…"). One minor register slip: "gritty, reluctant shudder" is strong, but the final paragraph's "his true currency" and "preserved time" feel slightly elevated beyond the established texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and figurative language is mostly controlled ("blind eye," "sandy cathedral," "luminous choir"). Information density is high in the music box sequence. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically—"gleaned redemption," "no longer just a collector, but a composer," "no longer a weight, but a purpose"—restating the transformation rather than advancing it. Paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy across adjacent lines in the closure third trigger −0.5. One clarity lapse: "conversations between the old world and the new" abstracts rather than concretizes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sound-jar method and honey-thyme solution to free a seized music box are specific and non-obvious. The vagrant-poet-as-memory-translator premise is fresh. Yet the emotional arc—loneliness reframed as purpose—follows a familiar redemptive template without a bold twist, and the final paragraph's summary delivery retreats from risk. The piece synthesizes elements well but lacks a decisive turn or moral calculus that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlo is present throughout and his choices (capturing wind, unearthing the box, brewing syrup, arranging jars) create beats. His decision to stay in the loft at closure shapes the ending image. However, most actions are procedural rather than high-stakes turns, and the vagrant-poet identity could be swapped for another solitary archivist with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.6, cost connection modest +0.3 = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The music box appears in the second beat (unearthed), sits as obstacle (seized mechanism), is transformed mid-story (honey syrup unlocks it), and plays the shanty that Arlo translates into jars. It is present in the closure beat when surrounded by jars and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.4, specificity +0.6 = high-7s. One micro slip: its mother-of-pearl detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is named explicitly in the final third ("This was his gleaned redemption") and operates as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. It does not alter Arlo's choices earlier; he was already committed to sound collection. Label-only use −0.8, late first appearance −0.4, ornamental −0.6, summary-only −0.5 = low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" is defined early ("not sad, but tenderly attuned to loss") and colors his movement and attention throughout. It constrains his choice to sweeten rather than force the music box, enabling the unlock. However, the trait could be replaced with "patient" or "reverent" without major loss. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, swappability −0.6, label tendency −0.3 = low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Sweeten" appears as verb and method: he uses honey-thyme syrup to loosen the music box's seized gears, the pivotal unlock that reveals the complete shanty. The act cannot be swapped (e.g., oiling would lack the thematic resonance). It is signaled mid-story and drives the climax. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = high-8s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jar method is established in the first third (wind in jar, gull-cries, dune sigh) and returns at closure when Arlo isolates the shanty's notes into multiple jars and imagines mixing them. It shapes his tactics and the final image ("luminous choir," "jars sang back"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = mid-7s. One friction: the mixing is promised rather than dramatized, reducing cost visibility −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The loft is vivid and present throughout (driftwood cavern, beneath dunes, "sandy cathedral"). It supplies the music box from the sand and provides isolation that frames Arlo's solitary ritual. At closure it is named ("stay here, in the feral loft") and reweighted as "no longer a weight, but a purpose." Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, lyric reprise +0.5 = low-6s. It does not meaningfully constrain mid-story choices or supply resources that alter outcome −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Dawn's earliest whistle" is poetic and present in the opening and closing, framing the narrative window. However, time does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock; Arlo works at his own pace ("For days it sat…"), and the timeframe could be swapped for "dusk" or "noon" without structural loss. Lyric reprise +0.5, swappability −0.7, ornamental −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5 = mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arlo's desire to "become the translator between generations" is stated early and drives his jar collection and music box effort. It is dramatized through his actions (capturing sounds, sweetening the box) and reaffirmed at closure ("translator in his sandy cathedral"). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.3 = mid-6s. One friction: the motivation is told more than conflicted; no competing want or fear tests his commitment −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named once mid-story and embodied throughout in diction ("wistful," mist, isolation, "sandy cathedral") and the final reconfiguration where loneliness becomes purpose. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from searching to resolved. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, tone modulation +0.8, charges final image +0.9 = mid-6s. One friction: the phrase "lonesome splendor" itself reads slightly decorative when named explicitly −0.3.</comment>
