<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elan's motivation to "illuminate value in the mundane" is clear, and his embodied action of reading the etched glass and throwing the stone shows character-specific perception. However, his epiphany about "hidden, luminous truths" arrives too cleanly without internal contradiction or cost; the insight feels handed rather than earned through struggle. The final choice to install both panes demonstrates agency, but no visible path is foreclosed—he loses nothing and risks nothing on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens early (a glazier encounters a mysterious message) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: the etched glass reweights "value" from utility to historical witness, and the final line makes the shift undeniable. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elan moves from curiosity to understanding via the pond ritual, narrowing his interpretive options. The cost, however, remains conceptual and oblique—no tactical price paid on the page—keeping this out of high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn, the Atrium's mist-veiled glass, and the brackish pond are vivid and purposeful. The etched pane functions as micro-setting that constrains Elan's attention and charges the final image when light casts "a web of luminous lines" across the floor. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop to pond to Atrium). The selectivity of detail—"salt-caked windows," "diffuse pearl"—reflects Elan's glazier's eye without catalog touring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is Elan's drive to understand the keeper's message and translate hidden value, signaled early and sustained. The pond-stone ritual provides one meaningful deepening that changes his interpretive options. However, escalation remains cerebral; no live option is foreclosed, no tactical cost paid. The fisherman's polite nod confirms the resolution but adds no pressure. Under a situational lens, the stance crystallization is legible but lacks felt friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: value resides not in objects but in "the light it was asked to hold, and the shadows it chose to cast." The etched glass, pond rings, and spectral floor-map accrue meaning without overt thesis. The final line—"some light is meant for seeing, and some is meant for reading"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. One deduction: "before everything shifts" recurs as a motif but never constrains a choice or alters tactics, reading as decorative recurrence rather than thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "His trade was reflection, not of thought, but of light upon glass" establishes a perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable. However, elevated diction—"noctilucent reckonings," "brackish," "testament"—edges above a working glazier's likely lexicon without sufficient dramatization of why Elan would frame his insight in such language. The fisherman's brief dialogue feels natural but is too small a sample to test voice distinction. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. "Before everything shifts" appears three times across the text (paragraph 1, paragraph 4, final line) without added pressure or reweighting—a paraphrase loop that nudges −0.3. Metaphoric density in the pond-rings passage ("dialogue of disturbance and resistance," "complex, fleeting tapestry") clusters without pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting (−0.3). The closure image is clear, but "The reckoning was permanent" in the penultimate paragraph tells what the prior image has already shown. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt a chill," "felt different") dulls immediacy at two moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a glazier deciphering an etched message through pond ripples—is specific and non-obvious. The stone-throwing method as communion is fresh. However, the emotional arc (curiosity → insight → installation) follows a template "artisan discovers hidden meaning" pattern without significant friction or moral ambiguity. The fisherman's polite incomprehension is a familiar beat. Risk-taking in the pond-ritual sequence elevates slightly, but the piece stays within safe bounds of lyric realism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elan is present throughout and his decisions (to study the glass, throw the stone, install both panes) drive all beats. His reflective nature enables the interpretive work but does not constrain or cost him tactically—he succeeds without trade-off. Two gates: setup (paragraph 1) and payoff (final paragraph installation); middle development is weaker (the pond insight is internal only). The character is necessary but does not face high friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Prism Atrium frames expectation in paragraph 1, houses the climactic glass installation in paragraph 5, and produces the spectral floor-map in the closure image—three beats. The mist veiling the glass is handled twice (paragraphs 1 and 5) and the structure's greenhouse-like nature matters. It is causally active in the ending and highly specific; removing it would collapse the closure image. Just short of indispensable because the pond, not the Atrium, supplies the interpretive method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Noctilucent reckonings appears in the etched text (paragraph 2) and is reinterpreted in paragraph 3 as "hidden, luminous truths only visible in darkness," directly shaping Elan's understanding. It primes the closure by reweighting what "value" means (darkness reveals, not day). Two gates: setup and payoff; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The concept is causally active in the ending but could be swapped for a similar metaphor of hidden meaning with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" is dramatized when Elan's hands find the etched text "visible only when the light hit just so" (paragraph 2) and again when he interprets the pond rings as "patterns… after it was thrown" (paragraph 3). Two beats, both enabling his insight. Setup in paragraph 2, development in paragraph 3, payoff in the closure interpretation. The trait is specific and shapes key turns, but no visible cost or constraint accompanies it—he simply succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Commune" is framed in paragraph 2 ("He needed to understand, to commune with this silent voice") and enacted in paragraph 3 via the pond ritual. The method of communion (stone-throwing) is the story's hinge; removing it would break the causal link to the insight. Three gates present. However, the communion succeeds without friction or failed attempts, making it feel more like a successful key turn than an indispensable struggle. Swapping to a different method (e.g., meditating on the glass itself) would require rewrites but not collapse the premise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pond-rings method is signaled in paragraph 2 ("The method came to him from childhood"), executed in paragraph 3 with specific mechanics ("the patterns in the rings after it was thrown, the dialogue of disturbance and resistance"), and yields the key insight that drives the ending. Three gates. The method is specific and its mechanics matter—"not on the stone's splash, but on the patterns in the rings"—but it appears only in one sustained beat and does not constrain later action. Removing this exact method would require substitution but not full collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is introduced in paragraph 1 ("diffuse pearl," "sea mist"), returns in paragraph 4 ("the world holding its breath at dawn"), and frames the fishermen's passage at closure. The mist supplies atmosphere and the dawn timing creates the "before everything shifts" pressure. Two gates: setup and payoff; middle use is descriptive. The setting does not constrain Elan's choices tactically—he could perform the same actions at another time or place with minor rewrites—but the dawn light is integral to the spectral floor-map in the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" bookends the story (paragraphs 1 and 6) and recurs in paragraph 4. The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten Elan's decisions—no clock forces his hand. Two gates: setup and payoff. The phrase accretes meaning lyrically (dawn as threshold, value before change) and charges the final image, qualifying for mid-band under lyric-resonance allowance. However, it remains swappable with a similar transitional metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elan's motivation "to illuminate value in the mundane" is declared in paragraph 1 and dramatized in all three acts: discovering the etched message (paragraph 2), interpreting it via the pond (paragraph 3), and installing both panes to display hidden history (paragraph 5). Three gates. The desire drives every choice and the closure image directly fulfills it. However, no internal conflict opposes this want—Elan never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible cost—keeping the motivation one-dimensional despite full integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" is embodied in the prose throughout: "reflection, not of thought, but of light" (paragraph 1); the pond's "complex, fleeting tapestry" (paragraph 3); the final line's pairing of "seeing" and "reading." The tone modulates from curiosity (paragraph 2) through contemplative focus (paragraph 3) to resonant closure (paragraph 6). It charges the final image when Elan's answer holds "a clear complexity" and the fisherman nods without full understanding. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the piece's intellectual-lyric register.</comment>
