<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alex's motivation is clear—pursuing truth through skeptical inquiry—but his interior remains generic and label-driven ("drowsy alertness," "religious skepticism") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The confession moment offers potential friction, yet Alex processes it through passive observation rather than embodied conflict. Mara's presence adds pressure but her interiority is absent, reducing the relationship to a plot device. The final "appraisal" reads as summary rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early and follows a causal path: Mara's confession → radio clues → tunnel discovery → spectral witness → return. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost shift finds its witness), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—"the truth, now weighed, could rest"—rather than a felt price paid by Alex or Mara on the page. The inferred lens is Causal with some Accumulative layering (radio fragments, valve wheel), but the ending deflates into summary ("appraisal," "lighter hush") instead of a charged final image, leaving the closure effect muted and the cost unexplored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel and mill boiler room are vividly rendered with rust, wet stone, and dripping water, creating coherent spatial choreography across Alex's descent. The beaded valve wheel recurs with specificity (worn smooth, beads like a code, endless turning), constraining Alex's interpretive choices and charging the final witness moment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Alex's explorer lens, though the spectral machinery section leans toward postcard description without altering tactics. The valve wheel's physical presence shapes the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early and pursued through psychic calls and tunnel exploration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Alex connects the radio caller's valve-wheel dream to the mill's history, narrowing his search. However, the ghost shift's resolution bypasses protagonist agency: the spectral figures respond to Alex's speech, but no trade-off or renunciation occurs; he witnesses and explains, then leaves. The cost is asserted ("moral one, finally measured") rather than dramatized, and coincidence (psychic broadcast as residual energy) enables rather than complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of buried truths and ignored responsibility emerges through Mara's confession, the valve wheel, and the ghost shift loop. The final paragraph over-articulates theme: "weight of the swallowed truth was not a physical mass, but a moral one, finally measured" and "some mysteries needed no faith, only attention" read as thesis statements rather than resonant images. The beaded valve wheel recurs purposefully, but its thematic charge is diluted by Alex's post-hoc summary. The piece invites reflection on collective memory and culpability, yet the ending explains rather than shows, lowering thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Alex with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct idiom mixing investigative cool and urban-explorer texture ("chasing rumors," "industrial graveyard," "historian's cool eye"). Psychic distance is consistent, though some diction ("appraise," "religiously skeptical") feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Mara's single line of dialogue is absent, limiting voice distinction tests. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "wondered") appear frequently but are not stacked to the point of dulling immediacy. Under pressure, Alex's internal texture remains steady, avoiding convergence, though the final beats drift toward expository summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but template cadence recurs: "He had seen," "He had developed," "He needed," "He remembered," "He understood," "He stepped," "He shared"—seven consecutive paragraphs open with "He [verb]," creating a drumbeat pattern across the closure section (−0.5 for template run). Paraphrase loops appear: "The weight of a swallowed truth" is restated three times without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("thin veil between then and now," "industrial graveyard") and label-only constructs ("drowsy alertness" repeated) reduce texture specificity. The final third is laden with summary and scaffold, dulling the closure image and disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ghost-shift premise and psychic-radio investigative method offer a fresh synthesis, but execution trends toward template urban-legend investigation: abandoned site, tragic past, spectral loop resolved by witness/acknowledgment. The beaded valve wheel is a strong specific detail, yet the emotional arc (witness → speech → release) follows a predictable path. The radio-psychic method is underused—two caller descriptions serve as clues but do not transform tactics or introduce friction. Alex's skepticism is asserted but never tested; no risk or bold perspectival choice heightens stakes. The story reads competent but does not surprise or reveal non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Alex is identified as a "reckless explorer of abandoned mills" early, framing expectation. His exploration drives the search through tunnel and mill, but "reckless" manifests only as movement through spaces—no on-page choice trades safety for discovery with visible cost. He listens, moves, and speaks to ghosts without friction or consequence. The trait is functional but replaceable with "curious" or "dogged" investigator. Two gates (setup, middle navigation) are met; closure participation is passive witness, not decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in three beats: (1) memory of the boiler room, (2) radio caller's dream, (3) spectral figure turning it endlessly, then stopping. It is signaled early (radio dream), recurs with specificity (beads worn smooth, arranged like code), and is present in the closure image where it stops turning after Alex speaks. However, Alex does not handle or use it; its meaning is reweighted through observation and summary rather than interaction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is indirect—it symbolizes ignored responsibility without constraining Alex's choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is introduced early as rumor, developed through radio calls and spectral figures tending machines, and is present at closure when the shift "finds its witness" and fades. It shapes the dominant stake (understanding the phenomenon) and alters Alex's tactics (seeking the valve, speaking acknowledgment). However, the concept remains more thematic echo than active constraint—Alex observes it rather than navigating its mechanics or rules. Setup, middle, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate, as the shift responds to speech but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated twice ("religious skepticism," "religiously skeptical") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Alex wonders if the ghost shift is collective memory, maintains skepticism even after seeing glowing figures, and concludes "some mysteries needed no faith, only attention"—yet no choice hinges on this trait. He neither rejects evidence due to skepticism nor pays a cost for abandoning it. The attribute is ornamental label rather than friction point. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears four times: Alex aims to appraise Mara's confession, appraises the valve wheel's significance, appraises the scene with a historian's eye, and shares his appraisal with Mara at the end. It frames his investigative stance and is present at closure, but the action is largely internal summary—evaluating rather than doing. The appraisals do not narrow options or force trade-offs; they restate conclusions. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak, as no appraisal changes tactics under pressure. Easily swappable with "assess" or "interpret" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method—interpreting frantic psychic-radio calls—is signaled early ("developed a method") and used in two beats: the beaded-valve caller and the whispers-tunnel caller. These clues guide Alex's path to the mill and validate his search, shaping middle tactics. However, the method is summary-told ("he often found cryptic clues") rather than dramatized with friction or false leads. Setup and development gates met; payoff is indirect (the calls were "fragments of memory"), but the method does not reappear or transform at closure. Functional but mechanically applied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (rust, wet stone, damp gloom) and remains the spatial frame throughout. It supplies the side passage leading to the mill and the dripping-water silence after the ghost shift fades, grounding Alex's descent and return. The setting pressures movement (deeper, toward a rusted door) and charges the final image (hush, drip of water, lighter feeling). All three gates met; the tunnel constrains choices (one-way search) and is present in closure choreography. Spatial coherence is strong; the tunnel is indispensable to the story's descent-and-return structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" is mentioned once in paragraph six ("During the hush that followed, Alex felt a drowsy alertness") and again obliquely at the end ("the hush between them felt lighter"). However, the bulk of the story (radio listening, tunnel exploration, ghost encounter) unfolds in unspecified continuous time; the confession's aftermath is not a live clock tightening decisions. The hush is more a tonal anchor than a temporal constraint. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates weak, as elapsed time never alters tactics or forecloses options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Alex's motivation—to find the weight of a swallowed truth—is stated early and pursued through the radio method and tunnel search. It is present at closure: "the weight of the swallowed truth… finally measured" and "felt lighter." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized with conflicting costs; no friction between Alex's want (understanding) and a competing need or fear creates tension. The motivation frames the search but does not force a visible sacrifice. Setup and payoff gates met; middle friction is absent, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is mentioned three times (initial hush, Alex moving forward, lingering at the end) and frames the mood of fatigued hyper-awareness. However, the tone does not modulate with escalating pressure—it remains a static descriptor rather than tightening or breaking at the ghost encounter or release. The final line repeats it as a "reminder," but the tone does not charge the image or reflect cost. Setup and payoff gates met; development is weak, as the tone is asserted rather than embodied through syntax, rhythm, or sensory degradation under stress.</comment>
