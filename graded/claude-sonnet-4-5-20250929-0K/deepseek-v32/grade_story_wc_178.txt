<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's frugality and devotion are stated but remain largely label-only; his choices (studying patterns, placing the tile, accepting the covenant) feel inevitable rather than psychologically contradictory. The final sacrifice—spending his finite essence—arrives as thematic irony rather than a dramatized internal conflict where competing impulses act simultaneously. Interiority is abstract ("devotion to the unknown") without embodied stakes that make us feel the cost before he pays it. The laugh at irony is told, not shown through body or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: "high chamber" and "reimagined Babylonian palace" appear early, but who Aris is and what immediate problem he faces remain vague until the tile discovery. The drive lens reads Accumulative (layering schematics and cosmic patterns until the tile glows), and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frugal life spent utterly, reweighting the premise. Cost is implied through "unraveled into schematic starlight" but felt pressure is muted by summary ("His consciousness unraveled") rather than a concrete image. The porque/therefore chain is loose—discovery of the tile feels coincidental, not earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace, terraced gardens, and ziggurat provide vivid anchors, and the magic square tile functions as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is coherent (chamber, floor, tile, diagrams), and the tile's placement at convergence constrains Aris's final act. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("dusky harmony," "soft internal light," "figures of fire"); other senses are absent. The setting shapes the climax (palace as astrolabe, tile as heart), lifting the score past ornamental description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to seal a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Aris studies, discovers, deciphers, and accepts without a meaningful tightening or trade-off that narrows live options. The tile's revelation and the covenant's demand arrive as exposition ("schematics showed that the tile was a conduit") rather than through a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The cost (total self-expenditure) is conceptually present but not felt on the page; Aris "did not hesitate," erasing friction. No reversal or complication tests his commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—frugality versus expenditure, devotion to the infinite—emerges clearly from the tile and covenant structure, and the ending's irony (hoarding leading to total spending) reweights prior material without moralizing. The magic square tile recurs with shifted meaning (curiosity → key → conduit → cooled artifact), and "encrypted devotion" functions as motif. However, the final image ("consciousness unraveled into schematic starlight") leans abstract rather than concrete, and "empirically ironic" is stated rather than dramatized through a specific sensory or relational cost. The scouts' dismissal of the tile offers quiet closure but lacks the charged particularity that would push resonance higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Aris; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dusky harmony," "covenant," "encrypted devotion"), though at peak moments it drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("his consciousness unraveled") rather than embodied perception. Perceptual signature is present (astronomer's lens: "schematic representations," "numeric cipher") but not deeply character-specific under stress. Psychic distance stays controlled. No dialogue. The prose has textural unity, but voice under pressure does not modulate or degrade—Aris remains composed and articulate through self-dissolution, which flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple loop and scaffold issues cluster in the opening and middle: "dusky harmony" appears three times; "schematic representations" and "encrypted devotion" recur as near-synonyms without added pressure; "between regimes" is paraphrased across two early paragraphs. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "His" or "The" in succession. Figurative language ("breath," "bleed," "unraveled") appears densely but remains serviceable. Information density is moderate—many sentences restate theme rather than advance causality. The closure beat ("unraveled into schematic starlight") is abstract rather than propulsive, and the scouts' coda adds scaffold without tightening the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian palace-as-astrolabe, magic square tile, and astronomer's sacrifice offers a specific angle, but the emotional arc (devotion → discovery → acceptance) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The irony (frugal life → total expenditure) is stated rather than discovered through an unexpected detail or choice. "Encrypted devotion" and "schematic representations" feel prompt-derived rather than organically embedded in world logic. The scouts' dismissal at the end provides mild freshness (the world moves on, the pact unrecognized), but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aris appears early (setup ✓) and his frugality shapes his years of study (development: reusing parchment, diluting ink). At closure he places his hands on the tile and accepts the covenant, but this is more inevitable completion than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path—he "did not hesitate." Swappable with "obsessive scholar" or "devoted mystic" with minor edits. Two beats (study, final acceptance) but minimal causal pressure or visible cost tied specifically to his frugality at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magic square tile is discovered in beat one (setup ✓), deciphered via schematics in the middle (development ✓), and placed/activated at closure (payoff ✓). It appears in three distinct beats and its numeric pattern constrains Aris's alignment action. The tile's properties (grid, convergence point, conduit) are specific and irreplaceable. However, its final state (cooled, discarded by scouts) does not reweight prior meaning with additional cost—it simply reverts. Strong integration but just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is named early (setup ✓) as the builders' cosmic prayer encoded in the tile. It recurs as label ("devotion… encrypted no longer") at closure, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice—Aris deciphers the cipher and accepts the pact without friction between competing devotions. Swappable with "hidden covenant" or "secret alignment." Present across beats but largely thematic echo rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is named late ("the attribute of his success was empirically ironic") in a single expository line near closure. It describes the frugality/expenditure reversal but does not constrain an earlier choice or enable a tactic—it is observation, not lever. Label-only mention. No setup or development beats; appears only in the final third as theme statement. Cap at 4.6 (late intro) with minor lift for closure thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: "to uncloak the secret" (thematic statement mid-story) and implicitly when Aris rotates the tile to reveal the covenant. The rotation is the major turn that triggers the tile's glow and the covenant's manifestation, but the action itself (alignment) is brief and mechanical—no visible cost or tactic shift tied specifically to "uncloaking" versus "activating" or "aligning." Functional but replaceable. Present at closure but not irreplaceable; swappable with "reveal" or "activate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is signaled early (setup ✓: "his preferred method") and used across multiple beats: spreading charts, mapping palace against constellations, superimposing diagrams, placing the tile on the master diagram (development ✓✓). At closure the method ("schematics showed") explains the tile's function and the pact's cost (payoff ✓). Three beats, clear causal role. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what does "superimposing diagrams" look like in action?—and swappable with "detailed maps" or "astronomical charts" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace, terraced gardens, ziggurat, and high chamber are anchored early (setup ✓). The palace-as-astrolabe structure enables Aris's schematic work and supplies the convergence point where the tile must be placed (development ✓). At closure the palace "breathed" and stones aligned (payoff ✓), though this is told summary. Specific and integral across beats, but the ending effect (scouts find diagrams) does not lean on unique palace properties—the setting could be swapped for another ancient observatory without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is established early (setup ✓: "after the old king's fall and before the new one's rise") and recurs thematically ("the interim," "between day and night"). However, it does not constrain Aris's timeline or create urgency—"time itself seemed suspended." The scouts arrive "days later," but no ticking clock alters tactics. Present but largely atmospheric. No middle development beat where the timeframe narrows options; closure mentions it ("in the interim") without causal weight. Cap at 4.6 (no meaningful development).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is named early (setup ✓) and drives Aris's years of study. At closure he accepts the pact and lets the covenant flow through him (payoff ✓). However, the motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires—Aris "did not hesitate," erasing friction between want (knowledge) and cost (self). No middle beat where the covenant's price forces a trade-off. Present and causal but not deeply conflicted; swappable with "to unlock cosmic secrets."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" recurs three times (opening, midpoint, closure), establishing a coherent twilight mood (setup ✓). Tone remains static—calm, contemplative—even as Aris dissolves; no modulation with pressure. The final image ("dusky harmony… silent, ironic testament") reprises the phrase but does not reweight it with new meaning or cost—it is echo, not charge. Functional reprise but largely ornamental. Two-gate integration (setup + payoff) without middle development; lyric allowance applies but the return lacks felt consequence.</comment>
