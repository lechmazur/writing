<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal state registers as "confidently uncertain" throughout but remains largely label-driven rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation to "thresh meaning" is stated early, but the peak choice—transmitting the corrective sequence—arrives without visible struggle or competing fears that would raise the cost. The pen functions more as symbolic prop than as an object that forces a micro-choice under pressure. Emotional progression is summarized ("breath held") rather than dramatized through bodily specificity or irrational hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with lyric coloring. Closure unit: Decisive Change (signal retrieval) + Conceptual Repricing (the "new dialect" reweights her error into growth). The piece establishes causality—algorithm → signal silence → corrective sequence → retrieval—but the middle escalation is told rather than shown, flattening pressure. Cost at closure is conceptual ("changed" signals, "deeper connection") rather than a forfeited option or visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clean; the single-scene window and one POV meet defaults. One meaningful tightening occurs but the final image leans on metaphor ("woven tapestry") instead of concrete dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is signaled early and returns in the ending ("less like a flaw and more like a heartbeat"), charging the final image with a shift in Aris's perception. The exotic nib glows at the climax, offering a concrete sensory anchor that constrains the moment. Spatial choreography (lab, desk, eastern wall) remains coherent. However, the station's broader environment is generic; sensory detail beyond the pull and the pen's glow is sparse, and the "low light" that reveals phosphorescent trails is mentioned only once without recursive use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repair the signal silence caused by her error. One on-page tightening occurs when she initiates the corrective transmission, but the decision arrives without visible trade-off or competing risk that would elevate cost. The climax—"hands steady despite the confident uncertainty"—is asserted rather than tested by a moment where failure or hedging would exact a legible price. The resolution grants success (signals return) without a forfeited path or tactical shift forced by scarcity. Escalation is more conceptual reweighting than on-page narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: error integrated into order, editing history as revision rather than erasure. The final image ("history she now knew was always a draft") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The pen, anomaly, and "wrong seeds" motifs recur and shift meaning at closure. However, several phrases—"confident uncertainty," "strange comfort," "unbending," "contingent relationships"—read as prompt echoes rather than dramatized particulars, weakening specificity. The thematic resonance is present but leans on metaphor more than concrete choice-cost friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, distance stable. Perceptual signature is present ("celestial signal interpreter" lens) but not deeply idiosyncratic; diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("semiotic," "contingent relationships") that feels essayistic rather than character-rooted. No dialogue on the page. The phrase "confidently uncertain" and "strange comfort" recur as labels without rhythmic variation. Under peak stress (transmission initiation), syntax compresses slightly ("breath held") but does not degrade perception or reveal character-specific processing. Voice is competent but not distinctive enough to charge the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no typos or pronoun drift. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken density: "editing history" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure; "confidently uncertain" appears twice in identical phrasing; "contingent relationships" is defined, then repeated. Template cadence in the middle third ("She began to map… Each connection she charted… Her task was to unbend") creates a mechanical rhythm. Figurative language ("threads in a tangled skein," "woven tapestry") stacks without clear vehicle logic. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("history she now knew was always a draft") rather than trusting the image to land. Line-level deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, figurative muddle −0.3, summary-over-image −0.2, accumulation cap applied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—scientist repairs cosmic anomaly through symbolic data correction—is functional but leans on familiar tropes (lone technician, mistake-correction arc, metaphoric redemption). The "dried-up pen with exotic nib" that glows during the fix and the gravitational anomaly as conversational partner offer modest specificity, but neither transforms the template into irreplaceable lived detail. The "editing history" frame and "wrong seeds" metaphor feel decorative rather than generating fresh tactical friction. Emotional arc (error → acceptance → integration) follows a predictable path without bold risk or non-obvious synthesis. Derivative Premise adjustment: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celestial signal interpreter is present throughout; she maps relationships, loads a sequence, and interprets new signals at the end. Early signal (job frames stakes), middle beat (mapping/transmission), closure participation (interpreting the changed signals). However, her interpretive work is mostly told summary rather than on-page decision pressure. Causal role is functional but replaceable; any scientist role could fulfill the same plot steps. Specificity moderate; cost generic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib appears in three beats: desk description (setup), mapping with phosphorescent trails (middle use), vibrating/glowing during transmission (closure participation). The exotic nib's meteoritic alloy and glow tie it to the anomaly, charging the climax. Specificity high (nib material, phosphorescence). Replacing it would require moderate rewrites. Cap intact (three gates met, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Editing history is stated as her "core concept," returns in the phrase "editing history, not by erasing her error," and echoes in the final line ("history… always a draft"). Present in setup, thematic middle reflection, and closure sentence. However, it functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page tactics or narrowing options. The corrective sequence is "unbending," not "editing." Swappable metaphor; causal role weak. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Confidently uncertain appears twice as a label (opening and transmission beat) but does not constrain or enable a visible choice with cost. No moment where uncertainty blocks an option or confidence misfires. The transmission proceeds "hands steady despite the confident uncertainty," which asserts the trait without dramatizing its friction. Present in setup and closure zone but ornamental. Late integration penalty mild; swappability high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unbend is stated as her task ("unbend this knot," "unbending of the folded space-time") and claimed complete at closure ("The unbending was complete"). Present in middle reflection and ending sentence. However, the actual action is transmitting a corrective sequence; "unbend" is metaphoric gloss rather than the enacted verb. Causal role exists but is indirect—removing "unbend" would require rephrasing, not restructuring. Swappable with "correct" or "unfold." Three gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Contingent relationships is introduced early ("the method to repair… was not through force but through contingent relationships"), used in the middle beat (mapping connections), and yields the paradox that drives the solution. Present in setup, middle development (mapping beat), and referenced at closure ("contingent understanding"). The method shapes her tactical approach (map relationships → derive sequence). Specificity moderate; replacing it with "hidden patterns" would require only minor edits. Three gates met; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is present throughout: opening pull, algorithm's target, signal-folding mechanism, intensified pull during transmission, final heartbeat metaphor. Early signal, middle causal role (it folds the signals, forcing her corrective method), closure charge (reweighted as "heartbeat" vs. "flaw"). The anomaly constrains her solution (she must work with its resonance, not against it) and supplies the ending's emotional shift. Irreplaceable; removing it breaks plot logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>After planting the wrong seeds anchors backstory (the recursive algorithm error caused the silence) and motivates the corrective arc. Present in setup (paragraph 4) and echoed at closure ("wrong seeds had grown into an unexpected harvest"). Setup and closure participation met; no middle beat where the timeframe tightens a decision. The "after" framing is static—no live clock pressure or escalating consequence tied to elapsed time. Lyric reprise reweights it slightly. Swappable with "after the mistake."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To thresh meaning from experience is stated as her motivation (paragraph 6) and claimed fulfilled at closure ("Threshing meaning from the experience, Aris understood…"). Setup and closure mention present but no middle beat where this desire conflicts with another want or forces a trade-off. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through choice friction. Swappable with "learn from this" or "find insight." Lyric echo at closure prevents fully ornamental score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Strange comfort is named in the opening (anomaly's pull), the middle ("strange comfort of the anomaly's pull"), and the ending lab tone ("tone in the lab was one of strange comfort"). Present across all three zones. The tone modulates slightly (pull as flaw → pull as acceptance → pull as heartbeat) and charges the final image. However, "strange comfort" is label-driven; sentence rhythm and diction do not consistently embody the oxymoron. Replacing the phrase with "eerie calm" would require only minor adjustments. Three gates met; tone coherence moderate; specificity weak.</comment>
