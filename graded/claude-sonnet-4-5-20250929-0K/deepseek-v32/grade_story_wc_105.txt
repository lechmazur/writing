<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's synesthesia trait is mentioned but never constrains a meaningful choice; her decisions unfold via exposition rather than embodied conflict. The childhood friend's lie is pure backstory setup without present friction. Interior work defaults to stock phrasing ("hard-won hope") and the final "mission accomplished" lands as summary, not earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive past 120 words without early pattern-teaching (−0.4). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but wavers—no clear causality chain, yet not enough density shift to charge closure. The ending declares success ("mission accomplished") without on-page cost or a legible before/after; creation of the device is summarized in middle beats, then the test/playback happens off-camera. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks provide vivid images but function as backdrop; the forge is used but spatial choreography remains vague (knee-deep water, "center of the crystalline dome" never tested by proximity or obstacle). Sensory detail leans heavily visual/aural without touch or temperature filtering through Elara's body under stress. No object or environment constrains a choice at closure, capping high-band entry per Q3 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find the sound of trust breaking") is declared early but never pressured by a live obstacle or trade-off. The forge ignites without complication, the imprint succeeds on first try, and the playback reveals an "undercurrent of repair" with no cost or refusal visible on the page. No tightening that forecloses an option; escalation reads as descriptive accumulation rather than rising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (trust, memory, healing) is articulated via direct statements ("trust must be heard to be healed") rather than earned from concrete particulars. The childhood friend's lie and shipwreck "monuments to broken trust" are symbolic placeholders without on-page friction. The final paragraph moralizes ("carrying the sound...as both a warning and a tool") instead of letting image resonate, triggering −0.6 for explicit theme summary at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during imprinting, wider during environmental description). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("battered marvel," "persistent gray," "shimmering silver for clarity") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular; Elara's perceptual signature (hearing colors) is asserted but not integrated into syntax or rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The impact of memories weighed on her; each imprint she studied revealed how past wounds echoed in present deafness" restates the premise without advancing it. Template cadence runs appear ("She heard...," "She recalled...," "She knew...") across multiple beats without pattern payoff. Stock metaphors ("hard-won hope," "battered marvel") cluster in the final third; filter-verb stacks ("she heard the colors," "she detected an undercurrent") dull immediacy in peak beats. Artifact penalties −1.2 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (synesthesia + memory tech + trust healing) assembles familiar elements without transformation. The sunken greenhouse, aurora-fueled forge, and hybrid fruits are vivid but ornamental; removing them would not alter emotional arc or closure. "Collecting absences" as method is asserted but mechanically applied. No bold risk elevates the synthesis; the emotional truth defaults to platitude ("trust must be heard to be healed").</comment>
