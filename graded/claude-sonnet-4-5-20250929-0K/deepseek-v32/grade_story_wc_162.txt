<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "featherly determination" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("quiet awe," "sense of reverence") instead of character-particular perception. The final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than earned struggle, and no meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words; "after the butterfly effect" and "drifting prism terrace" lack concrete spatial or temporal anchors, applying −0.4. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive tightening occurs; Elara moves through the maze and arrives at "understanding" without a causal reversal or meaningful narrowing of options. The closure unit ("she had discovered why") is told rather than shown, and no felt cost appears in the final image—she simply "walked away, forever changed" without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" and "twisted corn stalks" are described but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—benches and tables appear without clear layout, and the terrace's movement does not affect Elara's path. The wooden grain is referenced repeatedly but functions as thematic ornament rather than a physical constraint that shapes action. No tool, body state, or environmental detail charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is epistemological rather than urgent, and no visible cost or trade-off appears. Elara's movement through the maze encounters no opposition or reversal; she "intuited," "decoded," "realized" in a smooth sequence without a moment where options narrow or a live choice forecloses a path. The "necessary distances" are declared important but never tested under pressure. Escalation is absent; the piece reads as a guided tour rather than a struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme is stated directly in the penultimate paragraph: "they are the spaces where we intuit our connection to the world." The logbook, grain, and weather codes recur but function as thematic tokens rather than evolving through specific choices that test their meaning. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity is offered; the piece delivers a tidy moral without friction. The final image—"now she knew its music"—is abstract and does not reweight prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable, but the perceptual signature is generic: "featherly determined," "fractured hush," "necessary distances" repeat without evolving or filtering through Elara's specific worldview. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reverence washed over her") that does not match the concrete pilot-logbook framing. No dialogue appears. Interiority relies on filter verbs ("she intuited," "she wondered") and summary ("she realized") rather than immediate perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She intuited…" "She decoded…" "She realized…" across multiple beats, applying −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("necessary distances" restated without added pressure in adjacent lines). Stock metaphors ("featherly touch on her soul") and abstraction ("harmony restored") dull the closure. The piece carries information but lacks propulsion; many lines summarize state rather than advance action. Zero loops or scaffold is not met; clarity is functional but density is low.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—maze as initiatory space, weather codes as metaphor—reads as a templated setup without transformation. "Featherly determined" and "fractured hush" are decorative coinages that do not charge the narrative. The "butterfly effect" frame is invoked but never integrated into causality; it could be replaced with "apocalypse" or "dimensional shift" without altering the plot. The final insight ("spaces where we intuit our connection") is a generic platitude. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis is evident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. She observes, decodes, and moves forward without opposition or cost. Her role is passive recipient of insights rather than active agent whose decisions drive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The logbook appears early, is referenced in three distinct beats (terrace, threshold approach, final room), and its weather codes guide Elara's interpretation. However, decoding is described rather than dramatized, and the codes do not constrain her choices—she moves forward regardless. The logbook shapes her understanding but does not alter tactics or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is declared important and repeated across the narrative, but no scene tests what happens when the distance is violated or maintained incorrectly. It functions as thematic claim rather than a rule that alters options or tactics. The concept is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a label but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. It reads as decorative phrasing rather than a trait that shapes choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" recurs frequently ("she intuited," "intuiting") and drives Elara's understanding, but no turn traces to an intuition that changes tactics or reveals a cost. It describes her mode of knowing without altering the causal sequence; swapping "intuit" for "realize" would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analyzing grain appears in three beats (bench, post, final chair) and is signaled early. However, the analysis is described rather than shown to constrain or enable a choice. The grain "seemed to map" patterns but does not guide a decision that alters Elara's path or impose a trade-off. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The terrace is present throughout and "drifts," but its movement does not pressure Elara's choices or supply obstacles. It functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. The prism's light is mentioned but does not alter her path or charge the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the setting but does not impose a ticking clock or causal constraint. The timeframe is static; no urgency or temporal pressure tightens Elara's decisions. It reads as worldbuilding label rather than a force that shapes the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is stated early and drives Elara's movement through the maze. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; she pursues it smoothly and achieves it without friction. The motivation shapes structure but does not generate on-page pressure or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears in the opening, recurs three times, and modulates slightly in the final paragraph ("gave way to a soft hum"). The tone is coherent and supports the contemplative mood. However, it does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure or cost; the shift to "harmony restored" is declared rather than felt.</comment>
