<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and his tracker past is established, but interiority leans heavily on declarative summary ("his motivation was simple yet profound") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The shift from tracker to searcher-of-memory is told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final acceptance reads as arrival rather than earned renunciation with visible cost—no on-page foreclosure of a live alternative path is shown. Backstory dominates the middle without anchoring each block to a present-tense micro-decision that alters his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric design with charged callbacks). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The phonograph cylinder creates a tightening—riddle to memory to excavation—but the closure unit (photograph discovery) arrives through coincidence rather than protagonist agency, and the conceptual cost of "acceptance" is asserted in summary ("translated the vast distance of loss into the closeness of acceptance") rather than made undeniable through a final image or action. The Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance as Earned Stasis) is present but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard and cracked wasteland anchor the story early with vivid, selective detail (corrugated shack, skeletal library, rusted car door). The autumn leaf in wax recurs and charges the final beat by linking past to present. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the excavation sequence. The wasteland setting constrains Arlo's isolation and supplies the mound as the hiding place, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape choice or charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—closing the distance between past and present—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the riddle points to the mound, but the excavation itself involves no reversal or trade-off; the capsule simply awaits. The final "acceptance" is declared rather than shown as a choice that forecloses another path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present, but the cost at closure is told ("having translated the vast distance") rather than felt in a具体 image or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-preservation emerges through the leaf, cylinder, and photograph without overt thesis statements. The final image of the photograph clasped to his chest offers a concrete answer, though the note "Find me in the quiet places" edges toward thematic echo. Subtext operates cleanly in the riddle's indirection and the mirrored preservation motifs. The ending resists a stated moral, but the line "translated the vast distance of loss into the closeness of acceptance" is an abstract summary that replaces scene pressure in the final paragraph, triggering a −0.5 penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register ("a silence so deep it seemed to hum"). Perceptual signature is present in scent/sound/shift layering. The prose carries a distinct texture, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("translate distance into closeness") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is intentional and clean; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") are used sparingly and voice-motivated, fitting the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the final third contains paraphrase loops: "The distance between past and present collapsed" is immediately restated as "her memory was preserved" and "the tinted revelations had guided him." Template cadence appears in the middle ("He brought it back… He cleaned the cylinder… He spent days and nights") across three successive moves. Figurative language ("grooves themselves held multiple meanings," "silence wild with stories") sometimes blurs into vague metaphor. These patterns lower momentum without fully obscuring closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for two distinct issues: loops and template cadence).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic tracker premise and the wax-preserved relic are familiar genre elements. The phonograph riddle adds a modest inflection, but the core arc—solitary man finds keepsake of lost love—is a well-worn template. Specific details (pre-war library, grooves as secret texts) provide texture, yet the emotional resolution and the "translate distance into closeness" framing feel abstracted rather than earned through lived particulars. The transformation test suggests swapping names and objects would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arlo's tracker past is introduced early and his perceptual skill ("intuitively descriptive, perceiving the world in layers of scent, sound, and subtle shift") is tied to interpreting the cylinder grooves. However, his retirement is static backstory; the "bloodhound" identity does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice. The middle discovery (tracing grooves) uses his skill, and the final excavation echoes tracking, but no turn depends on a trade-off between his past and present selves. Two-gate presence (setup, middle) caps eligibility near 6.0, but swappability (any perceptive scavenger could do the same) and lack of closure causal pressure lower the score. Late penalty does not apply (introduced early). Causal pressure is weak; the element shapes interpretation but not decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The autumn leaf appears in the opening as Arlo's treasure, returns as the interpretive key to the riddle ("the leaf represented a place from before the war"), and is mirrored in the photograph's leaf at closure. Three-beat involvement (setup, middle insight, closure reprise) and clear closure linkage elevate the score. The leaf's preservation motif charges the ending image. However, the middle insight is told in summary ("Arlo saw that the leaf represented a place") rather than dramatized as a choice or constraint that alters tactics. Specificity is high (wax preservation mirrors cylinder encoding), but causal pressure is modest—the leaf prompts realization, not a trade-off. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5; ornamental middle use −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is introduced in the cylinder playback ("revelations were tinted, colored by the speaker's nostalgia and the cylinder's degradation") and mentioned again in the resolution ("The tinted revelations had guided him"). Setup and closure presence meet two gates, but the concept remains thematic gloss rather than a constraint that changes options on the page. The grooves' "multiple meanings" complicate interpretation but do not force a tactical choice with cost. The concept could be removed with minor edits to the narration of the cylinder scene. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.4, but ornamental use −0.8 and swappability −0.6 bring it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is labeled early ("Arlo had always been intuitively descriptive, perceiving the world in layers of scent, sound, and subtle shift") and applied in the middle when he traces the cylinder's patterns. The trait enables the key interpretive act but does not involve visible cost or trade-off—no moment shows his intuition failing or forcing a difficult choice. Setup and middle presence meet two gates; the trait shapes one beat (cylinder interpretation) but is not irreplaceable (any careful observer could trace grooves). Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal enable +0.8; label-only presentation −0.3, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The riddle is introduced when the cylinder plays, drives the middle interpretive work ("Arlo listened intently, his mind weaving through the puzzle"), and points to the mound location that yields the capsule. Three-beat structure (introduction, interpretation, payoff) and clear causal chain from riddle to excavation. However, the riddle's content is never specified on the page—"a riddle that spoke of loss and remembrance" and "hinted at a location" are summaries. The mechanics of solving it are told rather than shown, weakening irreplaceability; any clue device could substitute. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9; summary-only solving −0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder is found early, cleaned and played in the middle, and its message ("her final gift") is referenced at closure. Three gates and three beats. The grooves are described as "secret texts" and Arlo traces their patterns, but the method itself—reading grooves rather than simply playing them—is asserted more than demonstrated. No on-page moment shows him decoding groove-marks visually or tactilely in a way that differs from normal playback. The method is present but not mechanically distinct or irreplaceable. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.7; summary mechanics −0.8, swappability (ordinary playback would yield the same riddle) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is introduced in the opening line and anchors every scene. The cracked wasteland frames Arlo's isolation, the skeletal library supplies the cylinder, and the specific mound hides the capsule. The setting provides resources and pressures choice (excavation location). Three gates, strong early signal, and closure participation (mound as hiding place). Spatial choreography is clean. However, the wasteland's constraints are atmospheric rather than tactical—no moment shows the environment forcing a difficult choice with cost (e.g., scarcity, danger). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5; atmospheric-only constraint −0.8, minor swappability (any ruin could hide a capsule) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The post-resource-war timeframe is established in the opening and colors the wasteland setting and Arlo's loss. However, it functions as static backdrop rather than a tightening force—no on-page moment shows time pressure altering Arlo's decisions or tactics. The narrative clock is absent; days and nights pass in summary without consequence. Setup gate met, but middle and closure gates are not (the timeframe does not participate in the ending beyond thematic color). Early signal +0.5; ornamental use −0.7, no escalation role −0.6, missing closure gate (cap 2.8 waived because early setup is strong, but score remains low).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is stated early as Arlo's motivation and recurs in the resolution ("having translated the vast distance of loss into the closeness of acceptance"). The desire drives his engagement with the cylinder and excavation. Three gates (setup, middle action, closure). However, the phrasing is abstract and authorial; no on-page moment dramatizes friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. The motivation is told and reaffirmed rather than tested through a choice that forecloses an alternative. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0; told-only friction −0.9, abstract diction −0.5, no visible trade-off −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is introduced early ("a silence so deep it seemed to hum") and recurs at key moments ("The wild hush of the settlement seemed to deepen" at the revelation, "In the enduring hush, Arlo found peace" at closure). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure, supporting the lyric accumulation. Three-beat structure and closure participation. The phrase charges the final image by linking silence to acceptance. However, "wild hush" edges toward oxymoronic decoration—wildness and hush are contradictory without clear reconciliation in the story's logic. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, tone coherence +0.5; slight decorative quality −0.5, minor conceptual muddle −0.4.</comment>
