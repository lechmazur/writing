<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara remains a conceptual placeholder with label-only interiority ("groundedly imaginative," "ignorance cartographer") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in action. Her professional vocabulary floods even crisis beats with register mismatch ("lattice of cause and effect drawn from historical cycles and behavioral seeds"). The final choice—sending the document—lacks visible cost on the page; we are told her models predict acceptance and systemic change, but no personal forfeiture or fear crystallizes in the moment. Motivation is asserted through exposition rather than micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: the document becomes "charged with potential energy" and the final image asserts "transformation was now seeded." However, cost is declared rather than felt—"its work complete" tells us success without showing a visible price (risk, doubt, or material consequence). The predictive-modeling exposition pervades without concrete dramatization of a turn that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is present (quill to vellum), but the cost-proof test fails; I cannot point to a specific sentence where the price is legible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor setting early and recur purposefully. The kingfisher quill functions as micro-setting, though its constraint is thematic (symbol of precision) rather than tactical—it does not alter a choice on the page. Spatial choreography is clean (lectern, vellum, vial, lamp). The spire "seemed to lean in" offers atmosphere but does not pressure a decision. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, achieving the 7+ band, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains a choice or charges the final image) is not met; the setting frames rather than forces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed innovation within dogmatic constraint) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the quill descends and Elara begins writing, but the escalation is told through predictive-model exposition rather than dramatized reversals. The constraint (no outright rebellion) shapes her written tactics, yet no live complication forces a trade-off on the page. The resolution—document sent at dawn—is declared successful via retrospective summary. Cost clarity fails: we are told her ideas will propagate and previous cartographers were silenced, but Elara faces no visible price or friction in this beat. One meaningful pressure point is present, but the Band guardrail for 8.0+ (forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off) is unmet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (mapping ignorance, transformation as cultivation) emerges from recurring images: frozen lake, kingfisher precision, "third way, hitherto unmapped." The final line offers resonance ("the sustained hum of change, patiently awaiting its season") but it is an abstract summation rather than a non-literal answer grounded in a concrete image. The predictive-modeling frame invites reflection, yet the margin note on "reciprocal adaptation" remains ornamental. Subtext operates in the spire's "lean" and the feather's iridescence, but the closure statement moralizes transformation rather than letting the image charge it. Earned wisdom arises from particulars, yet the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature (cool analysis meets visionary leap) is coherent. However, diction frequently drifts into academic register unmotivated by crisis: "equations of societal flux," "behavioral seeds," "decision-making algorithms in the council halls." At peak beats (quill descent, document completion), the prose remains explanatory rather than immediate. No dialogue is present. Free indirect thought is clean, but psychic distance never tightens under pressure—the narrator's voice is uniform from opening to close. Purposeful compression is not taught; the elevated lexicon reads as constant rather than voice-modulated. The 9+ gate (distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure) is half-met: signature is present, but rhythmic shift at climax is absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She wrote of... She detailed... She wrote until..." across multiple beats in the climax triggers −0.4 to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("roots beneath frost," "garden of branching paths") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she had spent") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-story: "Her work was groundedly imaginative" echoes "her groundedly imaginative mind" two paragraphs later. Information density is moderate; many sentences tell rather than advance. The loop/scaffold screen and patterned-artifact penalty pack apply (baseline −0.6 in Q7, escalated to −0.8 because template cadence touches the closure beat). No figurative muddle, but propulsion is sluggish and zero-loop requirement for 9+ is violated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ignorance-cartographer premise offers a fresh occupational metaphor, and predictive modeling as speculative-fiction method is purposeful. However, the emotional arc (lone visionary seeds change through a document) is template; the transformation test fails—swap names and setting, the structure remains generic. The kingfisher quill and obsidian spire are vivid particulars, but the final image ("the sustained hum of change") abstracts rather than specifies. No bold structural risk; the piece follows explanatory tell-heavy progression. The Derivative Premise Guardrail applies moderately: the core (write a transformative document under constraint) is familiar, and while world logic is specific, the moral calculus and stakes remain one-dimensional. Adjustment: −0.5 to −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (ignorance cartographer) is present throughout and her role frames all beats. She makes one key decision: lifting the quill and inscribing the document. However, this choice is prepared by extensive exposition rather than a turn that narrows options. She does not face a complication or reversal that forces adaptation. Setup, development (predictive modeling), and payoff (writing complete) are present, meeting two-of-three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice to write is inevitable from the opening. Closure linkage is strong ("the kingfisher feather quill lay still, its work complete"). Swappability: a different occupational frame (archivist, scribe) could replace "ignorance cartographer" with modest edits. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5, label-only trait −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, round to 5.2 in the functional-but-replaceable to one-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kingfisher feather quill appears in setup (description beside lectern), development (lifted, dipped in ink), and payoff (final rest). It is handled in three distinct beats. Its iridescent blue and origin story (bird diving through ice-free waters) are specified, reducing swappability. The quill enables the core action (writing) but does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning—its symbolism (precision, insight) is static. It charges the final image ("lay still, its work complete") with closure linkage. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, no causal pressure or cost connection −0.0, ornamental first mention (description) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, but strong closure presence and specificity lift to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is the conceptual spine: Elara's predictive models, the blank vellum, the act of inscribing a document to alter decision-making algorithms. Setup is early (opening paragraph). Development: the concept shapes tactics throughout—each word is "a node in her predictive network." Payoff: the document is described as "charged with potential energy" and "a script for a future already yearning to exist." The concept changes options: her writing is framed as seeding transformation, not merely recording. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we never see a specific prediction tested or revised. Adjustment: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes tactics) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (abstract mechanics) −0.4, summary-only in middle beats −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, round to 7.1 for strong thematic and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" appears as a label in setup ("Her work was groundedly imaginative") and payoff ("her groundedly imaginative mind"). It does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost; it is asserted as character trait without dramatization. The method (predictive modeling merging cool analysis and visionary leap) illustrates the trait, but no on-page moment shows Elara choosing grounded over imaginative or vice versa. Label-only −0.6, no causal pressure −0.0, swappable ("pragmatic visionary") −0.5, present in two beats (mentions) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.1 = 2.3, adjust upward slightly for thematic coherence to 4.1 in the functional-but-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Prevail" is the climactic verb: "To prevail, her written forecast must be so compelling..." and "Elara had prevailed through predictive modeling." It frames the stakes (overcoming dogma) and the resolution (document complete). However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized—we do not witness a struggle or cost that makes prevailing uncertain. The element is present in setup (stakes), development (writing), and payoff (declared success). Swappability: "succeed," "overcome," "achieve" could replace with minor edits. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.5, no visible cost −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, round to 6.3 for strong setup and payoff framing despite weak dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is signaled in setup ("compiled her predictive models, equations of societal flux"), shapes development ("her calculations indicated," "her models suggested a single, elegant intervention"), and appears in payoff ("Elara had prevailed through predictive modeling"). It enables her choice of what to write and is presented as the core method. However, the mechanics are abstract—we never see a model tested, adjusted, or contradicted. The method is told rather than shown in action. Adjustment: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes what she writes) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, summary-only (no dramatized modeling beat) −0.6, specificity moderate +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, round to 6.9 for strong method integration despite lack of concrete dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire by frozen lake anchors setting from the opening and recurs in the final third ("In the obsidian spire by the frozen lake"). The spire's reflective facets and monochrome chill create atmosphere. The frozen lake is a thematic mirror (rigidity she hopes to soften). However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elara could write this document anywhere. The spire "seemed to lean in" during writing, adding texture but not altering tactics. Adjustment: early signal +0.7, two beats (opening, closing) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, thematic charge (mirror) +0.4, no causal pressure on choice −0.0, postcard description bias −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round to 5.7 for solid atmospheric and thematic work without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" frames the timeframe in setup ("This moment, before the pen meets the blank page, was always the most profound") and closing ("Before the pen had met the page, there had been only silence"). The entire narrative occurs in this anticipatory window, creating a bounded present. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures Elara, and the moment of descent is stretched across hundreds of words without urgency. The timeframe is thematic (potential) rather than tactical (deadline). Adjustment: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, thematic resonance +0.4, no live clock or tightening −0.0, vague elapsed time −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, round down to 4.8 due to lack of pressure from the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is Elara's stated motivation (opening: "to seed innovation within a constraint, the rigid dogma") and recurs at payoff ("Transformation was now seeded"). The constraint (no outright rebellion) shapes her written tactics. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or costs. We do not see Elara torn between safety and risk, or between competing values. Adjustment: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (shapes document content) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, told-only without friction −0.6, no visible cost tied to desire −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, round to 6.4 for strong thematic and tactical integration despite weak dramatization of conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" operates as tonal through-line: Elara seeks "sustained transformation," writes of "gradual, organic change," and the ending emphasizes "the sustained hum of change, patiently awaiting its season." Tone is coherent (measured, anticipatory, not violent rupture). However, the tone is static—no modulation with pressure; the opening and closing carry identical register and tempo. The final image charges the tone thematically but does not shift cadence or emotional color. Adjustment: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, coherence +0.5, static mood (no modulation) −0.8. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, round to 6.1 for strong thematic coherence with limited tonal range.</comment>
