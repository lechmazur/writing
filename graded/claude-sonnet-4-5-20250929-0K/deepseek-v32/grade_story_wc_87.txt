<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to "align heart and action" is signaled early and drives the kayak journey, but the interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("backlash of regrets," "merrily melancholic") that function more as labels than embodied contradictions. The compass-jettisoning beat shows a concrete choice with cost, lifting the score. However, the reflection-heavy mode (well over 30% of the text) anchors weakly to present stimuli in the middle third, flattening micro-choices until the throw; this triggers BRR concern but remains within expanded reflection-led allowance since the ending choice lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis plus micro-turn toward future action). The compass throw is a visible forfeiture that shifts Elian's stance, and the final utility-pole navigation reweights the opening despair with cost (loss of the old symbol, acceptance of humble method). One meaningful deepening is present, meeting the length expectation, but cost proof is somewhat diffuse—the "felt lighter" line and the turn toward shore are adequate but not sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch, fog, channel marker, and utility poles anchor space and constrain Elian's navigation choices across beats. The compass as micro-setting (body-held object) charges the throw and final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt wind, cold water, sea spray) and filtered through Elian's defeated lens. However, spatial choreography during the drift and marker encounter could be sharper; the headland reveal feels slightly telescoped without intermediate cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elian's need to align heart and action—is signaled early and tightens through the compass throw, which forecloses reliance on the past and opens the humble utility-pole path. One meaningful deepening (the scream and jettison) narrows options with felt cost. The channel marker functions as a situational pressure point that triggers the release. The final turn toward shore demonstrates agency, but the utility-pole solution arrives with minimal tactical struggle, slightly lowering urgency in the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—letting go of broken systems to embrace humble present tools—emerges through the compass throw and utility-pole navigation without overt statement. The "merrily melancholic" recurrence and the contrast between celestial/humble methods create subtext. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: Elian navigates home by markers he once dismissed, accepting wreckage as the start of rebuilding. Minor slip: "align heart and action" is repeated almost verbatim across paragraphs, edging toward thematic echo, though it remains tied to his goal rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with perceptual specificity (navigator's lens on poles, channel marker, compass mechanics). Diction is mostly character-apt, though "merrily melancholic" and "backlash of regrets" recur as fixed phrases rather than evolving through varied syntax, creating minor template cadence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the scream, wider during paddle strokes). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The voice reads distinct but not quite rhythmically varied under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are evident: "backlash of regrets" appears nearly identically in three separate paragraphs; "merrily melancholic" recurs with minimal syntactic variation; several sentences restate the heart/action misalignment without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("He was… He had… He would…") creates rhythmic monotony. Clarity and propulsion are generally maintained, but these artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. The compass-throw and final-pole beats are clean, limiting penalty under the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The navigator-using-utility-poles conceit offers a specific, non-obvious twist on "finding your way" material, and the compass jettison avoids the expected restoration. However, the emotional arc—despairing loner finds clarity on the water—follows a familiar template, and the "backlash of regrets" + "align heart and action" phrasing edges toward prompt-response artificiality rather than organic voice. The synthesis feels purposeful but not startling; transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian ("broken navigator") frames the story, makes the compass-throw decision that alters tactics, and chooses to return guided by utility poles. Present in setup, middle choice (throw), and ending (paddle home). High causal pressure and closure linkage; the character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The astronomical compass is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (laid in cockpit, felt for weight, thrown overboard), and its jettison is the pivotal action that shifts Elian's stance. Returns with reweighted meaning (from "monument to wreckage" to discarded anchor). Strong causal pressure, closure participation, and specificity; nearly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is named early and recurs as a phrase shaping Elian's internal state. It motivates the journey and the scream but remains more thematic label than on-page constraint that visibly narrows options. Present in setup and thematically at closure (quieted but carried forward), with some middle pressure. Functional but partly swappable with "weight of the past" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" is named three times as a mood descriptor but does not demonstrably enable or constrain a specific choice with visible cost. It colors tone and interiority but remains ornamental—removing it would not break plot logic. Present across beats but non-causal; label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gravitate" (toward deeper water, away from solid world, no longer toward the past) appears in setup and final turn, framing Elian's directional pull. The shift from gravitating toward past to future marks a meaningful reweighting at closure. Early signal and closure participation, but mid-scene development is thin; more lyric reprise than causal driver. Edges into mid-6s on the strength of the charged return.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles is introduced early (setup), used tactically in the middle (sighting along poles as they grow sparser), and becomes the method that guides Elian home at closure. Shapes two beats and the ending choice; mechanics matter (alignment, sparseness, distant headland reveal). Strong causal role and closure linkage; removing it would break the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch bookends the story (setup and return) and constrains Elian's action (shallows, cockpit, beach). The fog and channel marker apply situational pressure. Present in setup, middle (marker encounter), and ending (beached return). Supplies resources and pressures choices but does not uniquely drive a middle turn; somewhat swappable with "shore" or "harbor." Solid two-gate integration with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" is named as the timeframe anchor ("That was the timeframe…") and contextualizes the compass failure and Elian's brokenness. It primes the journey but does not create live urgency or tighten tactics on the page; it functions as backstory marker rather than active clock. Setup presence and thematic echo at closure (new expectations forming), but no middle constraint. Functional yet largely static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To align heart and action" is stated as Elian's motivation in the opening third, drives the compass throw (action freeing the heart), and is reaffirmed in the closing beats ("movement felt like alignment"). Shapes at least two key choices with visible cost (throw, return paddle). Desire is dramatized through friction (dissonance, scream, jettison). Strong causal pressure and closure participation; nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" is introduced early, recurs across beats (guttering candle, grows steadier after throw, casts light at end), and modulates with pressure to charge the final image. Tone is coherent and purposeful but remains somewhat metaphorical rather than behaviorally visible. Present in setup, middle (flicker/gutter), and ending (steadier light), with clear reweighting. Solid integration but not fully embodied in action; edges above mid-band on lyric consistency and closure charge.</comment>
