<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is established through bodily discipline and withheld touch, but her motivation to defy conformity remains abstract until the courtyard dance. The Lord Protector's shift from calling guards to paralysis feels unmotivated—no prior contradiction or internal struggle earns his reversal. Embodied emotion is present in the dance sequence ("tremor of the hand became a seismic shock"), but the escalation from patient thread-work to "raw truth" lacks intermediate micro-choices that show contradictory impulses in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the dissolving echo-sanctuary and silver-sheen snow crystallize a completed defiance with felt cost (her body "finally her own poem"). Orientation anchors early (chambers, courtyard, turret). The causal chain from thread-untangling to courtyard dance to Lord Protector's witness holds, though the Protector's paralysis lacks clear prior setup. One meaningful deepening occurs when private labor becomes public declaration, reweighting the stake of self-expression with visible vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and silver courtyard are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (fractured starlight, "sound like a sigh and a smile combined"). The courtyard's spatial choreography is clear, and the threads rising from snow create a charged final image. The "faint, permanent silver sheen" constrains future interpretation of the space, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Micro-setting (velvet cushion, crystal dome) supports the protagonist's progression without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking her voice by defying conformity—is signaled in the opening paragraph. The tightening occurs when private thread-work becomes public performance, narrowing her options to visible rebellion. The Lord Protector's paralysis introduces a new tension, but his raised hand to "call the guards" arrives late and lacks prior setup as a live threat. Cost is visible in the "alarming serenity" and permanent trace left on the courtyard, though the stakes could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of bodily autonomy versus imposed silence emerges through the thread-untangling metaphor and courtyard dance without overt moralizing. The final image—"her body finally her own poem, read aloud to a listening night"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of self-expression. The lattice of echoes and the permanent silver sheen provide a non-literal conceptual repricing. Minor slip: "deafening echo within his own hollow core" edges toward telling the Protector's thematic shift rather than trusting implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's discipline ("bodily poetic," "withheld touch"). The final paragraph shifts briefly to the Lord Protector's perspective without a section break, creating minor head-hopping. Diction is controlled and literary ("spectral rivers," "comet's tail"), though some phrases feel elevated beyond necessity ("alarming serenity" recurs without evolving meaning). Rhythm modulates well during the dance sequence, accelerating with short clauses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high in the opening and dance sequences, but several phrases loop conceptually: "bodily poetic" appears three times; "alarming serenity" twice without clear reweighting. Mixed metaphor: threads "pooled like liquid mercury" then "began to rise" and "catching the fractured light" conflates material states. "Sigh and smile" frame is elegant but mechanical when repeated exactly ("a sound like a sigh and a smile combined"). Figurative language in the climax ("seismic shock," "shimmering lattice," "symphony of rebellion") clusters heavily without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity under pressure (−0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—chaste courtesan using thread-untangling as literal/metaphorical unlocking—offers a fresh synthesis of bodily discipline and silent rebellion. The prism sanctuary and echo-harvest concept avoid stock settings. However, the "rigid society stifles artist who breaks free through performance" arc is familiar, and the Lord Protector's paralysis before beauty reads as a well-worn trope. The silver sheen as permanent trace adds a memorable closing detail, elevating the piece above template execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive the arc: entering the turret, untangling threads, descending to the courtyard, and performing the dance. Her decision to move publicly rather than remain in the sanctuary creates the key turn. Observation and interiority dominate the opening third, but the courtyard sequence is action-driven with visible cost (exposure, permanent trace). Present in all three gates; causal pressure evident at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in two distinct beats: Elara's arrival (description, moonbeam fracture) and the threads catching fractured light from above during the courtyard dance. It enables her private work and then charges the public climax by projecting spectral light onto the lattice. Early signal, middle use, closure linkage satisfied. Specificity (crystal dome, spectral rivers) makes it irreplaceable. Cost connection: the sanctuary's light makes the rebellion visible to the Protector.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named early and enacted when threads emit audible memories ("gasp of childhood surprise," "rustle of a turned page"). The concept shapes her method: gathering unsung bodily experiences. It appears in the climax when the echo-lattice dissolves into glowing dust, reweighting the stake of reclaimed voice. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how threads hold sound is asserted, not grounded in tactile detail. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is named three times but functions mainly as a label for Elara's art form. It constrains her life (a discipline of "precise gesture and withheld touch") and the courtyard dance is described as "bodily poetic unraveled into its raw truth," but the trait itself does not create a visible tradeoff or cost on the page. The dance could proceed without the label. Late payoff (courtyard) is present, but no middle beat shows the attribute enabling or blocking a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unlock" drives the structure: unlocking voice by untangling threads, unlocking the prison of her form. The action is literalized (knot yields, threads pool) and metaphorized (each freed strand "a sigh given form"). The final turn—threads rising and weaving into a lattice—depends on the unlocking having occurred. Early signal, middle enactment, closure linkage satisfied. Swappability test: replacing "unlock" with "release" or "free" would require only minor edits, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Untangling threads is signaled early, enacted in a sustained beat ("her fingers patient and cool"), and the freed strands enable the courtyard performance. The method is concrete (spools, knot, pooled mercury) and its completion triggers the midnight descent. However, the mechanics are summarized ("each freed strand felt like a sigh") rather than shown across discrete attempts. Present in all three gates; causal pressure evident (no threads, no lattice), but mid-scene dramatization is compressed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow anchors the opening image, recurs as destination, and provides the stage for the climax. Snow absorbs the dissolved lattice, leaving a "faint, permanent silver sheen" that charges the ending with conceptual cost. The courtyard's stillness ("alarming serenity") mirrors and challenges the conformity Elara defies. Early signal, middle navigation (descent), and closure participation satisfied. The setting constrains (public visibility) and enables (witness, permanence), making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" is introduced as the "fleeting moment where true feeling lived before it was sculpted" and returns in the lattice's dissolution ("a sound like a sigh and a smile combined"). It frames interiority but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The midnight tolling provides a clock, but no choice is altered by temporal pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the opening phrase, but the timeframe remains metaphorical rather than tactical. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "defy the lullaby of conformity" is named early and dramatized through the courtyard dance. Internal conflict appears when the "language felt like a cage," and the final act forecloses safety (visibility to the Protector, permanent trace). The Lord Protector's raised hand to call guards introduces external friction, though it arrives late. Friction between want (self-expression) and cost (exposure, rebellion) is visible at closure. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure evident.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named twice and enacted throughout: the soundless snow, the "utterly still yet electric" air, the Lord Protector "disturbed from compliant dreams" yet paralyzed. Tone modulates from private discipline (cool fingers, patient work) to public rupture (seismic shock, rising choir) while holding the paradox of calm and threat. The final image—silent courtyard with permanent silver sheen—completes the tonal circuit. Setup, development, and payoff satisfied; tone charges closure and remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
