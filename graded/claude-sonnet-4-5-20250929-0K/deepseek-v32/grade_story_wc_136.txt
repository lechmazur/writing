<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "analytically artistic mind" and "trembling certainty" are declared labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The protagonist moves through each beat without meaningful internal conflict—opening the door, reading the book, exiting—all occur as smooth procedural steps rather than as choices that foreclose paths. The final "transformation" is asserted ("changed by her journey") but never dramatized through a specific renunciation or stake-altering decision with visible cost. Emotional states are named ("heart pounded," "fear and excitement") rather than shown through perception degradation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural (arrows, vault, cracks, whispers build a pattern), but the closure effect—returning to the city "changed" and "ready to map new routes"—is told rather than shown through a final image that reweights prior material with cost. The phantom punch opens the door and later the chamber door, but these actions do not narrow options or impose a felt trade-off; the fortress yields its secrets without resistance. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (Elara, city's edge, midnight), avoiding penalty there. The final paragraph cycles through thematic summary ("routes that acknowledged the unspoken, embraced the mysteries") rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration on the page, and no visible cost is legible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "starlit vault enveloped by fog" and "cracks forming arrows" provide vivid sensory anchors, and the phantom punch as a handled object returns across beats. Spatial choreography remains clear (city edge → mist → vault → fortress base → door → corridors → chamber → exit). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the arrows guide Elara without imposing constraint or forcing a tactical choice, and the vault's beauty and terror do not pressure her decisions. The micro-setting (punch, cracks) appears in multiple beats but does not alter her tactics or charge the final image with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early, but escalation reads as procedural accumulation rather than tightening pressure. Each step (following arrows, using punch, opening door, reading book) succeeds without resistance or trade-off; coincidence (arrows appearing, door opening) solves rather than complicates. The book reveals "her own truth... a personal mystery she had long ignored," but this insight is summarized, not dramatized, and no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Agency is present in "dared to use it" and "dared to face," yet these dares do not narrow options or force a hierarchy-of-values decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—confronting unspoken truths—is stated repeatedly ("unspoken truths," "mysteries unraveled," "secrets shared") rather than emerging from image and event. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "True navigation required listening to the whispers of the world" and "Routes that acknowledged the unspoken, embraced the mysteries, and dared to change" are abstract thematic statements, not resonant images. The phantom punch and cracks recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they are mentioned ("direction was etched in her heart") without reweighting prior material. No concrete particular at the end offers a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: "meticulous route mapper" sees patterns, but her noticing ("subtle carvings," "mix of fear and excitement") could belong to any observant protagonist. Diction is consistent but bland, with recycled stems ("trembling certainty" x3, "analytically artistic" x2, "unspoken truths" x5) and stock constructions ("Her heart pounded," "With a deep breath"). Voice lacks distinct texture; syntax and rhythm do not modulate under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "meticulous route mapper" → "analytically artistic mind" (adjacent lines); "trembling certainty" recurs in three separate paragraphs without reweighting; "unspoken truths" appears five times across the text, often as synonym churn ("mysteries," "secrets," "truths left unsaid"). Template cadence dominates the final third: "She [verb]" appears in nine consecutive sentences ("She approached," "She encountered," "She moved," "She read," "She had dared," "She exited," "She returned," "She realized," "She smiled"). Figurative language is sparse but mixed: "starlit vault" is both literal architecture and metaphor without clear boundaries. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance ("The fortress loomed, its secrets buried deep" followed by "approaching a giant door" adds no new pressure). Apply baseline artifact penalty of −0.8 in Q7 for template runs and loops, plus an additional −0.3 for final-third contamination, totaling −1.1 adjustment within band; loops and stems also disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—mysterious journal leads to phantom realm via magic object—closely matches widely used portal-fantasy templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "fortress of unspoken truths" is a generic metaphor; swapping it for "library of forgotten names" or "temple of hidden memories" would require only minor edits. Elara's journey follows a predictable arc: discovery → threshold crossing → secret revelation → return transformed, with no fresh inflection or earned surprise. The phantom punch and glowing arrows are convenient plot devices rather than organically integrated constraints that arise from world logic or character flaw. No risk-taking heightens stakes; every beat confirms expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout but decisions are procedural (follow arrows, use punch, read book) rather than creating key turns. "Meticulous route mapper" trait does not constrain choices or generate cost; Elara's analytical skill is mentioned but never tested by a trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying two gates, but swappable with "determined seeker" or "curious scholar" without structural change. Functional but replaceable: 3.0 baseline +0.3 early signal −0.1 swappability = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Object used in two distinct beats (opens door to fortress, opens chamber door) and mentioned at closure ("glowed on her belt, its purpose fulfilled"). Early signal present (inherited from grandfather, described in first third). However, the punch solves problems it did not create; the doors have no visible locks, so the punch's mechanism is ornamental rather than enabling a tactic under constraint. Present in all three gates, but causal pressure is weak (doors would open regardless). 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.9 two beats +0.7 closure mention +0.3 specificity −0.7 solves-without-creating −0.6 ornamental mechanism = 3.9, but closure participation is passive mention rather than active reweighting, so cap at closure-mention credit only: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Concept framed early ("unraveling mysteries") and repeated at closure ("mysteries unraveled"), but it shapes theme more than on-page stakes or tactics. Elara's analytical approach is declared, not demonstrated through a specific puzzle or trade-off between analysis and intuition. The fortress yields its book without resistance; no mystery is unraveled through her choices, only revealed. Two gates (setup, ending mention) met but middle development weak. 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.4 one beat (reading book) +0.4 ending mention = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Attribute declared twice ("analytically artistic mind" in paragraph two, "analytically artistic insight" at closure) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No scene shows Elara choosing between analytical precision and artistic intuition, or using one to solve what the other cannot. Label-only. 3.0 baseline +0.3 early mention −0.5 label-only = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Action "dare" appears in three beats: "dared to use" the punch, "dared to face the fortress," and retrospective "her dare" at closure. However, no major turn traces to the dare itself; the punch activates without resistance, the fortress opens, the book is read. The dare is a summary label for courage rather than a specific irreversible act. Two gates (middle use, ending mention) met. 3.0 baseline +0.4 one beat (using punch) +0.7 closure mention −0.5 summary-only −1.0 swappable with "chose" or "decided" = 2.6, but gate credit for middle+ending lifts floor to 4.6 cap for missing causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Method signaled early (cracks form arrows before her) and returns inside the fortress (arrows point to chamber, then outward at exit). Mechanics are passive guidance rather than a puzzle Elara solves; she follows without cost or tactical choice. Three gates met (setup, middle, ending). 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.9 two beats (outside, inside, exit) +0.7 closure participation +0.3 specificity −0.9 ornamental (no agency required) = 4.3, but three-gate participation and ending reprise lift to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setting introduced early (starlit vault, mist) and present at closure ("starlit vault faded," "mist dissolving into dawn"). Description is vivid but does not pressure choices; Elara moves through it without environmental constraint altering her tactics. The vault is postcard scenery rather than a crucible. Two gates (setup, ending). 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.4 one beat (entering vault) +0.4 ending image −0.5 postcard description −0.7 no tactical constraint = 3.9, but setup+ending gates lift floor to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" appears in opening and closing paragraphs, and midnight is mentioned once ("Midnight approached"). However, time does not tighten decisions; no clock pressures Elara's moves, and the journey's duration is untracked. The hour is metaphorical framing rather than a live constraint. Two gates (setup, ending mention). 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.4 ending mention −0.5 metaphor-only, no live clock = 3.2, but two-gate floor is 3.4 per the model.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to find the fortress of unspoken truths") and drives the journey across all beats. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; Elara pursues it without friction or trade-off. The book reveals "her own truth," adding personal stakes, but this insight is told, not chosen under pressure. Three gates met (setup, middle pursuit, ending achievement). 3.0 baseline +0.8 early framing +0.9 two beats (journey, book) +0.7 closure linkage −0.7 told-only at key moment −1.0 no friction between want and cost = 3.7, but three-gate participation lifts to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tone "trembling certainty" declared three times across the text (opening, midpoint, ending) and modulates slightly (fear and excitement mix, resolve holds firm). However, the tone is asserted via the phrase itself rather than charged through rhythm and diction; sentences remain syntactically uniform under pressure, missing the tremor. Present in setup and ending. 3.0 baseline +0.3 early +0.4 ending mention +0.3 recurrence −0.4 static phrase, rhythm does not modulate −0.3 label-only in peak beats = 3.3, but setup+ending gates lift floor to 4.3.</comment>
