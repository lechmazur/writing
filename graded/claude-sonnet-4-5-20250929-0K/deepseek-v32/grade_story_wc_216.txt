<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") is declared but never genuinely tested through contradictory impulses or cost. Her moves—visiting markets, decoding fragments, touching urns—proceed smoothly without internal conflict or visible trade-offs. The final "gentle knowing" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered via summary rather than embodied choice. Emotion is labeled ("terrifying and clarifying") rather than dramatized through specific perception or physiological response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "emerald silo" without spatial or temporal anchors until deep into the opening (−0.3). The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (gathering clues → sensory imprint → understanding), but the closure—"collective breath of memory"—lands as thematic assertion without visible cost or foreclosed option. The obsidian fragment unlocks a console and map, yet this opens rather than narrows her path; no decisive change or renunciation occurs on the page. The inferred lens wavers between Causal (clue-gathering) and Textural (mood accumulation) without a coherent tightening at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo's "translucent green mineral" and "aquatic gloom" are vivid, and the spiral staircase descent into a chamber with "residual energy" provides atmospheric texture. However, the setting remains largely postcard description; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a pressure beat. The obsidian fragment's physical function (fitting a lock) briefly charges the middle, lifting the score into mid-band, but the final image does not leverage spatial detail to reconfigure meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding time's texture) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through agency or reversal. Elara's method (garage sale codes) attracts replies without friction; the obsidian key unlocks the console without cost; the complete urn delivers the sought sensation immediately. No live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by scarcity or failure. The piece reads as a smooth accumulation of discoveries rather than escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—time as sensory imprint versus numerical abstraction—is coherent and arises from the capsule conceit. The final line ("collective breath of memory, waiting always to be rediscovered") offers a resonant image, but it states the thesis rather than letting particulars speak. The urn fragment's shift from cold shard to warm vessel with sensory payload provides one earned thematic turn, preventing a lower score. However, "anticipated mysteries resolve into a new, gentle knowing" is abstract declaration, not dramatized resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "chronological essence" veer toward coined abstraction without grounding. Perceptual signature is thin; Elara notices in the same register whether touching obsidian or reading holograms, with no stress-driven modulation. The prose occasionally lifts ("slow fade of light, the chill of approaching night") but more often defaults to exposition ("This was the true purpose...").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate, but momentum lags under expository scaffolding: "she realized," "she now saw," "Elara finally understood" recur as summary bridges (paraphrase-loop −0.2). Template cadence appears in the opening third: "Her world had softened… Her sole charge… Her first clue" (−0.4). Filter verbs ("felt suddenly timeless," "she was flooded with") stack without voice motivation. The final paragraph front-loads thematic summary ("no longer just… now inviting… waiting always") instead of letting image carry weight. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—time capsule storing sensory moments after numbers lose meaning—is conceptually intriguing but executed through familiar quest beats: find clue, decode map, retrieve artifact, gain insight. The garage-sale-code method is mentioned but never shown in action with friction or ingenuity. The urn-as-memory-vessel and green-silo setting feel decorative rather than transformed by specific lived detail. Emotional arc (mystery → knowing) follows a tidy, low-friction template without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara as "borrowed-time timekeeper" is present throughout and her role frames the premise (setup ✓), but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, decodes, and receives insights without agency-driven reversals. The role label appears in opening and closing paragraphs but remains ornamental to the causal chain; swap "archivist" or "curator" and the beats hold unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The obsidian urn fragment appears early (setup ✓), functions as a physical key in the console slot (development ✓), and is understood as a sample vessel at closure (payoff ✓). It drives two distinct beats: initial examination and console insertion. However, the final "complete urn" is a different object; the fragment itself does not return with reweighted meaning in the ending image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is the central artifact (setup ✓), its breach and leaking essence motivate the investigation (development ✓), and its blueprint guides the final library vision (payoff ✓). It shapes the dominant stake across beats. Yet the capsule's "damage" never imposes a visible constraint or cost; Elara accesses what she needs smoothly, making the "damaged" qualifier decorative. Swapping to "mysterious capsule" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is mentioned once in paragraph mid-story ("felt suddenly timeless herself, adrift in a moment without measure") as a label for her emotional state. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it is a momentary interiority note without mechanical consequence. No development or payoff; the trait does not return or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the framing verb (setup ✓) and drives two beats: correlating fragments to find the sublevel lock, and touching the complete urn to retrieve a sensory imprint (development ✓, payoff ✓). The action is central but not irreplaceable—swap "recover" or "decode" and the structure holds. The final paragraph uses "rediscovered" again, offering a lyric reprise, but without additional pressure or cost at that moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The garage-sale method is introduced early (setup ✓) and mentioned as receiving replies that guide Elara to the archive note (development ✓). It reappears in the closing vision ("method of hidden messages would continue"). However, the mechanics are never dramatized on the page; we do not see her craft a listing, witness a market exchange, or face friction from the wary communities. The method functions as convenient backstory rather than a shaped choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named early (setup ✓), its green gloom provides atmosphere, and the spiral descent to the sublevel chamber stages the console beat (development ✓). The closing image returns to "that silent, green-lit space" (payoff ✓). Yet the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains backdrop. The translucent mineral and aquatic light are vivid but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After numbers changed meaning" is the premise established in the opening (setup ✓) and recurs when Elara decodes the map's "lost numeric language" (development ✓). The timeframe shapes world logic and motivates the investigation. However, time itself does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters moves; Elara's pacing is leisurely ("days sifting," "each weekend"), with no urgency or deadline visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To understand the texture of time passing" is stated early (setup ✓), drives the search through fragments and caches (development ✓), and is declared satisfied in the final paragraph (payoff ✓). The motivation is present across beats but never dramatized through conflicted choice or cost. It remains a thematic claim rather than a lived want tested against fear or need; told-only execution prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" anchors tone in the opening ("Her world had softened into anticipated mysteries") and recurs near closure ("the anticipated mysteries resolve into a new, gentle knowing"). The tone is coherent—contemplative, exploratory—and modulates slightly from wonder to satisfaction. However, it remains a single static mood without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. The tone supports the concept but does not charge the final image with undeniable cost or reweighted meaning.</comment>
