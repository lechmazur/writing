<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amir's motivation is coherent—survivor's guilt fused with scientific obsession—and his maimed hand provides embodied grounding. The phantom pains are stated as "intangibly tangible" but lack micro-choice friction; the final slump shows endurance with cost, though the choice to override safety feels slightly underdramatized. Internal contradiction (grief as both wound and fuel) operates across the piece. No voice convergence issues in this single-POV frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure reads as Charged Poise: the discovery is complete, the wound in reality confirmed, and the protagonist is left with the unanswered question "what could one possibly do with it?"—a reconfiguration of stakes with felt cost (desolation, the exhilaration receding). The lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the hunt unfolds through precise steps (breakers cool → pulse → resonance spike → geode sings → air shimmers) and the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening (the override, the leak) narrows options. Orientation is clear by the second sentence. Cost is visible in the final paragraph's "twin weights of discovery and desolation."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vivid and purposeful: the dish aimed at the desert floor, the console, the emergency lights after shutdown. The geode constrains the climax—its frequency guides the final perturbation—and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor slip: "high desert" and "miles below" anchor geography, but the observatory's altitude and the scrub-and-sand target could be slightly more concrete to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove the theory, find the pooled potential) is signaled early and escalates through the resonance spike, the geode's song, the override, and the shimmering leak. The override decision narrows options with visible cost: circuit failure, loss of power, and the unanswered operational question. Agency is clear. The final question ("what one could possibly do with it") lands as a tightening that forecloses easy resolution. One meaningful pressure point; no requirement for multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grief as a physical trace, the geode as resonator, the leak as wound. The ending offers a non-literal answer—proof without solace, knowledge without suture—that reweights the premise. No moralizing; the final image (slumped, still, twin weights) is resonant. The "unfiltered awakening" concept is dramatized through the geode's song and the colors bleeding into twilight. Subtext operates in the contrast between the wedding memory and the silent, mournful echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (the geode as anchor, phantom pains, the hook-in-heart memory) is consistent and character-specific. Diction fits a traumatized scientist without register drift. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean: "Time to hunt" and "This was it" anchor interiority. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the override, longer reflection in the final paragraph. Minor slip: "calibrated nothingness" reads slightly abstract for hard-SF framing, but the voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (geode as paperweight/focal point/wedding relic, phantom pains mirroring the concept). Rhythm varies without template cadence. Clarity is strong. Minor loop: "intangibly tangible" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs (phantom pains, then scars), functioning as thematic echo but risking redundancy (-0.2). No major artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud ear passes; propulsion is consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of perturbation-theory hunting and emotional-residue pools is fresh and specific; the geode as resonator between intangible and physical is a non-obvious synthesis. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap and commits to its premise. Risk-taking (sustained technical frame, quiet ending with unanswered operational question) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative echo: "survivor guilt drives researcher" is a familiar template, but the specificity of the method and the wedding-drone strike anchor transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening; survivor identity shapes the motivation, the memory is the hook driving the hunt, and the maimed hand anchors embodiment. The override choice at climax is directly tied to proving what was lost at the wedding. Causal across at least three beats (setup, memory as trigger, override). Closure linkage: the unresolved question is rooted in his survivor's sentence. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode appears in beat one (paperweight/focal point), reappears during the hunt (anchor to tangible world), becomes active at climax (sings, acts as resonator), and is present in the final image (silent and cold). Four distinct beats; causal role (guides the final perturbation via frequency); closure linkage (the dormant crystal charges the ending). Removing it would break the bridge mechanism and flatten the final contrast.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two frames the awakening as "not a philosophical idea, but a physical law laid bare." Development: the geode's song is described as "the unfiltered awakening." Payoff: the leak and the final paragraph's "awakening only to the knowledge of the wound" reweight the concept. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle use is labeled rather than choice-constraining. The concept shapes theme and tone but does not directly narrow tactics. Closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two introduces phantom pains and survivor's guilt as "intangibly tangible, forces with no physical substance that nonetheless shaped his every moment." Development: the trait is restated but does not constrain a middle choice. Payoff: the final paragraph's "twin weights" echo the concept. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting; no causal pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff); swappable with "abstract yet visceral" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hunt is the dominant action: "Time to hunt" signals it, the sequence (pulse → map disturbances → seek harmonic → increase resolution) dramatizes it, and the final question ("what one could possibly do with it") extends the hunt's logic. Three beats; closure linkage (the quarry is found, the question shifts). Causal pressure: the hunt narrows to the override. Removing "hunt" would collapse the plot into passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two introduces perturbation theory as the method. Development: the observatory emits "a pulse of calibrated nothingness," he sends "another, finer perturbation," and the override directs "a sustained, focused perturbation" using the geode's frequency. Three beats; causal role (the method enables detection and the leak). Closure linkage: the method exhausts power, forcing the shutdown. Mechanics are signaled and matter. Slight swappability ("resonance mapping" could replace with edits), but the term anchors the scientific frame.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory is present from the title and opening sentence. The console, dish, array, main viewer, and circuit breakers are handled across four beats. The setting supplies resources (the array's power, the geode's placement on the console) and pressures choice (the override consumes the last power, forcing shutdown). Closure linkage: emergency lights and cooling silence frame the ending. Spatial choreography is clear. Irreplaceability is high; a ground-based lab would not support the "floating" isolation or the miles-below framing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: opening sentence and "The breakers hissed, their red diodes blinking to amber. Time to hunt." Development: the sequence unfolds in compressed real-time (initiate → data stream → spike → increase resolution → geode sings → override → feed → shimmer → breakers click). Payoff: "The circuit breakers clicked" ends the window; "cooling silence" anchors the aftermath. The timeframe tightens decision (he must act before full cooldown or after), but the clock is more frame than active constraint. Two gates; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation is stated in paragraph two and dramatized through the hunt: he seeks the fingerprint of wasted joy, remembers the wedding, identifies the pool, and overrides safety to see it. The final question ("what one could possibly do with it") extends and reweights the motivation. Three beats; causal pressure (the desire drives the override); closure linkage (the motivation is fulfilled yet deepened into a new dilemma). Friction between want (proof) and cost (desolation) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tone is introduced early ("bleak exhilaration") and sustained: "surge of bleak exhilaration," "exhilarating high receding, leaving the familiar bleakness," "twin weights of discovery and desolation." The tone modulates with pressure (exhilaration peaks at the leak, recedes at shutdown) and charges the final image (perfectly still, held by discovery and desolation). Coherent across all beats; closure linkage is strong. The oxymoron is embodied rather than declared, avoiding ornamental use.</comment>
