<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness shapes her methodology (water refraction, warmth patterns on paper) and her repair choices emerge from embodied expertise. However, her emotional arc is thin: she begins calm and capable, finishes calm and capable, with no internal contradiction or visible cost. The final smile and "quiet achievement" confirm competence but do not foreclose a path or test a value hierarchy under pressure. Leo's apprentice report is functional but adds no relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara completes the repair and the shop reaches "magnetic calm...full of purpose," reweighting her role from artisan-in-waiting to confirmed guide for the voyage. Cost is primarily conceptual—her stake in the ship's departure is emotional rather than material—and the anchor-lift timing crystallizes her self-measurement. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the anchor's rhythmic clanking build to the final convergence of ship, drone, and calm. Orientation is clean by paragraph one (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hairline crack is diagnosed, narrowing the repair path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, tin roof, ceramic dish, and slanted sunbeam constrain Elara's diagnostic method and anchor the sensory hierarchy (sound, texture, warmth). The water dish and light beam are micro-setting elements that enable the plot turn (crack diagnosis). Spatial choreography is clear (stool, workbench, high window, door to depot). The anchor chain's escalating clanking provides aural punctuation that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair the drone to enable safe navigation—is signaled early and tightens when the crack is found, narrowing repair options. Agency is decision and action (diagnosis, resin application, activation test). The cost is understated: success confirms competence but no live option is visibly foreclosed; the alternative (failure) is never dramatized as a real threat. Pressure accumulates through the anchor's rising rhythm but the outcome feels preordained, reducing felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair-as-mapping and blindness-enabling-sight emerges through concrete particulars (water refraction, warmth patterns). The anchor lifting serves as an external clock and metaphor for Elara's self-measurement without overt statement. However, the ending offers a tidy affirmation rather than a resonant, non-literal answer: "decoded noise into map, confusion into course" borders on thesis statement. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the resolution is symmetric satisfaction without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (sound, texture, warmth) is consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates from meditative opening to focused repair sequence, with diction anchored in her artisan expertise. Leo's single line of dialogue is functional but generic; no subtext or voice distinction. Filter verbs ("listening," "perceiving") are voice-motivated and fit the blind POV. No head-hopping or psychic distance slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high in the repair sequence (crack diagnosis, resin application, activation). Minor overwriting in paragraph one: "familiar blanket," "her heart was in every restoration," and "magnetic calm" stack metaphor without necessity. The final paragraph's "silent choir of color" and "decoded noise into map" tilt toward elevated diction but remain within the established voice. No clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The blind artisan using light refraction is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that transforms the "skilled craftsperson" template. The water-dish diagnostic method and the anchor as external timekeeper offer fresh angles. However, the emotional arc is risk-averse: Elara succeeds without genuine struggle, and the ending confirms her competence rather than testing it. The "heartfelt artisan" framing and the serene-to-serene progression follow a median path that avoids complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive two beats: diagnosing the crack via water refraction and applying resin. Her blindness-adapted method is causally essential and the final activation choice closes the sequence. She is present in the ending ("Elara smiled, listening") and her decision to test the drone charges the closure image. Cost is understated (no alternative path dramatized) but her agency is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drone is introduced early (paragraph two), handled in three beats (diagnosis, repair, activation), and its repaired state enables the ship's navigation, linking to the anchor timeframe. The "crystalline eye dark" → "eye capturing stable light" progression shows evolving use. It appears in the closure ("hummingbird's steady, guiding hum") and its function reweights Elara's role. Removing it would break the plot and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The repair shop frames Elara's expertise and houses the diagnostic tools (ceramic dish, water, resin). It is signaled early ("haven for broken things") and the setting enables the plot (workbench, high window for light). However, the shop itself does not constrain choices or alter tactics under pressure; any well-lit workspace with water would function. The shop is more backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blindness constrains Elara's diagnostic method (water refraction, warmth patterns) and shapes her perceptual signature throughout. It enables a unique repair approach (no sighted artisan would use this method) and is present in all three repair beats. The trait appears in the closure ("listening to the ship's departure") and carries visible tradeoff: she cannot see the rainbow but reads it through warmth. Cost is demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The patch action is the plot's fulcrum: diagnosis identifies the crack, patching narrows to "micro-application...a meditation," and the successful seal enables activation. It appears in two beats (application, verification via light test) and directly shapes the ending (drone activation depends on the patch holding). Swapping "patch" for generic "fix" would dilute specificity. The resin vial and steady hand add embodied detail.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water-refraction method is signaled early (paragraph two: "examining light refraction...to diagnose minute fractures"), demonstrated in paragraph three (beam through water projects spectrum, warmth patterns on paper), and verified in paragraph five (rainbow "pure and undistorted"). It shapes two beats (diagnosis, verification) and is causally essential: no other method in the story could find the hairline crack. Mechanics matter and are shown on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The depot is anchored early ("mist-coated rail depot...port awakening") and the mist softens the morning sun, affecting light quality for the refraction test. The tin roof vibrates with the anchor tone, adding sensory texture. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome; the repair could occur in any building with a window. Postcard description outweighs tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The anchor-lift timeframe is signaled early ("Today was the day...Aethelstan would begin its maiden voyage"), escalates rhythmically (distant groan → clanking → deep resonant tone → ship begins to move), and shapes two beats (crack diagnosis coincides with first groan, final test coincides with anchor lifting free). The live clock tightens decisions implicitly and charges the ending image (ship departure and drone hum converge). Removing the timeframe would deflate thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to decode feedback into direction" is dramatized in paragraph four ("decode this feedback into reliable direction was her motivation") and enacted in two beats (diagnosing scrambled harmonics, restoring clear chime sequence). It is present at closure ("decoded noise into map, confusion into course"). However, friction between wants and costs is minimal: Elara's desire is never conflicted and no competing stake complicates her choice. The motivation is clear but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is signaled early ("magnetic calm") and modulates purposefully: meditative focus during diagnosis, "serene focus" during repair, "magnetic calm settled in the workshop" at closure. The tone remains coherent through pressure shifts and charges the final image (calm as achievement rather than passivity). However, the tone is largely static—Elara begins calm and ends calm—without a meaningful break or reweighting under stress. A single mood held throughout trends mid-band.</comment>
