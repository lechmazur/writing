<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is declared early but his interior life remains generic and abstract. The story tells us he speaks truths and has "honest intent" but never dramatizes internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. His epiphany about midnight being "a lost force of balance" arrives as an unexplained realization rather than through earned struggle. The final choice to "weave a lattice of sound" unfolds without visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" and "where" anchor by ~80 words, but "when" (perpetual twilight since "the event called midnight") remains abstract throughout. The closure attempts a Decisive Change (light restored), but the mechanism—Arlo's verbal acknowledgment that "the light was not stolen"—contradicts the story's own setup ("midnight stole the last pure light") without causal groundwork. The final transformation dissolves into summary ("These points raced along...") rather than dramatized action. Inferred lens: Causal, but the because/therefore chain breaks at the climax when a single spoken line reverses the covenant's decay without prior dramatized struggle or cost. Apply −0.5 for orientation drift and −0.8 for the causality break at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced early and its acoustic properties shape Arlo's plan (sound can "shape reality"). The music box and philosopher's stone chip are handled across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography is vague—no sense of room size, position of objects, or Arlo's movement within the space. The final image lacks environmental texture; the chamber "filled with...dawn" is told rather than shown through sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim the light) is signaled in line three. Pressure remains static: Arlo's plan unfolds in a smooth sequence without reversals, obstacles, or narrowing options. The story declares "the timeframe was precarious" but no ticking clock affects his choices. The climax turn—realizing midnight is "not a thief, but a lost force of balance"—arrives without prior friction or cost; speaking this truth immediately solves the problem. One tightening (needing to bind midnight itself) is functional but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus dishonesty emerges through the covenant's attribute and Arlo's candor. The final realization—"mending what was always whole"—attempts a conceptual reweighting but is stated rather than earned through particulars. The piece leans on prompt labels ("tinkersong wonder," "covenant of rust") as thematic shorthand rather than building resonance through concrete images. No motif recurs with shifted meaning; the philosopher's stone chip dissolves without charging the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited. Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a repairman's probable lexicon: "scrupulously," "essence," "resonant call," "lattice of sound." Perceptual signature is generic; Arlo notices abstractions ("metaphysical pact," "invisible fractures") rather than tactile shop-floor particulars. The single line of dialogue ("The light was not stolen...") reads as thesis delivery rather than embodied speech. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was not stolen," "was hidden") dull immediacy at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "mending what wasn't torn" appears three times with minor variation; "covenant of rust" is restated across six lines without adding pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "The chip flared... / He was mending... / The resonance chamber throbbed... / Arlo poured..." Sequential "The [noun] [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors: "echoes of day," "memory in the shadows," "warm radiance burst forth." Register drift into abstract academic diction ("metaphysical pact," "coalesc­ed") clashes with the repairman POV. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops, templates, and stock phrasing; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—sound-based repair, light as covenant—offers mild novelty but leans on fantasy-template abstractions (philosopher's stone, midnight as entity). The central turn (midnight is balance, not theft) is a stock inversion without fresh synthesis. Execution follows a checklist: declare stakes, state plan, perform plan, succeed. The ending offers no risk or ambiguity; all threads resolve symmetrically. Removing the music-box and rust specifics would leave a generic "restore balance through truthful magic" plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Arlo is present throughout and performs the key actions (winding the box, speaking truths, weaving the lattice). However, his choices do not create turns; the plan unfolds as declared without obstacles forcing adaptation. His realization about midnight arrives unexplained rather than through decision under pressure. Functional protagonist presence without agency-driven escalation. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak—no forced choice), payoff (present but passive). Cap at mid-4s for replaceable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chip is introduced early (workbench, line 9), placed into the music box (mid-story), flares during the climax, and dissolves into light points that merge with the covenant. Three distinct beats with causal involvement. However, its properties (why it pulses, why it dissolves) are asserted rather than demonstrated through constraint or cost. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present. Swappability moderate—any "luminous fragment" could substitute. Score in upper-6s for multi-beat presence with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is named early and frames the problem (corroded, binding light to matter). It reacts to Arlo's honesty (shimmers, gleams) and is restored at the end. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Arlo's plan proceeds unimpeded. The covenant is backdrop rather than active stake-shaper. Gates: setup ✓, development (mentioned but passive), payoff ✓. One beat (honesty response) plus closure participation earns mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "wilts near dishonesty" trait is explained (line 11–12: "every action and word here had to be scrupulously true") but never tested. Arlo speaks only truths; no temptation to lie, no moment where dishonesty would solve a problem. The attribute is rule-stated rather than constraint-dramatized. Gates: setup ✓, development ✗ (no choice constrained), payoff ✗ (not invoked at closure). Functional world-building detail without causal work. Cap at 3.8 for swappable, untested trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tether" appears four times: line 14 (plan to tether light), line 21 (tether midnight itself), line 31 (weave lattice to tether), line 39 (sonic tethers). The action drives the climax and is irreplaceable—removing "tether" collapses the resolution mechanism. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than shown; we're told sound "tethers" but never see resistance or cost in the tethering act. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Strong closure linkage, moderate specificity. Score in low-6s for indispensable presence with abstract execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is introduced early (line 6) and reprised near the end (line 34: "mending what was always whole"). The paradox frames the task and charges the final paragraph. However, the method's mechanics are never clarified—how does one mend the unbroken? The concept is lyric resonance rather than tactical constraint. Gates: setup ✓, development (thematic only), payoff ✓. Lyric early-to-final reprise with thematic reweighting earns upper-5s under the allowance, but lack of middle constraint limits scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is named in line 1, its acoustic property ("sound could shape reality") established by line 4, and invoked throughout (amplifies ticks, curved walls carry notes, throbs with potential). The setting enables Arlo's method and is irreplaceable—no other space could provide the acoustic magic. The chamber directly shapes tactics and participates in the closure beat. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (acoustic property enables plan), payoff ✓ (chamber throbs, fills with light). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Score in low-7s for essential, beat-spanning integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears three times (lines 16, 22, 36) and "precarious" once (line 16). The timeframe is declared urgent ("last echoes of day faded," "moment hung") but never tracked or tested—no ticking clock alters Arlo's choices or pacing. The phrase functions as atmospheric label rather than pressure mechanism. Gates: setup ✓, development ✗ (no time constraint forces adaptation), payoff (present as phrase only). Ornamental urgency without causal work. Cap at mid-4s for untested, swappable time claim.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Arlo's desire to reclaim the light is stated early (line 3) and drives the plot structure. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—no scene shows what the lost light cost him personally, no moment where reclaiming it competes with another want or fear. The goal is pursued without visible friction or sacrifice. Gates: setup ✓, development (goal pursued but not tested), payoff ✓ (goal achieved). Functional stake-driver without embodied struggle. Score in mid-5s for structural necessity with thin dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named twice (lines 5, 43) and the tone attempts lyric, archaic diction ("whispering dome," "velvety blue," "gentle dawn"). The tone is present but static—no modulation under pressure, no darkening when stakes rise. The final image maintains the same gentle wonder as the opening, missing an opportunity to charge the tone with the cost of restoration. Gates: setup ✓, development (consistent but flat), payoff (present but unchanged). Coherent mood without dynamic range. Score in low-5s for stable but non-evolving tone.</comment>
