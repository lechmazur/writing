<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "gentle radical" stance and desire to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" are told as labels without embodied tension—no moment shows her torn between mercy and steel-like resolve. The retrocognitive trait is mentioned but never complicates a live choice; it's a special effect rather than a constraint that forces her to sacrifice something on the page. Internal voice relies on abstract philosophical phrasing ("warm coldness," "aberrant mercy") that reads as thesis rather than lived experience under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, avoiding orientation penalty. The closure—speaking the new name "Khalish" and feeling a "subtle shift"—qualifies as Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens, but the cost is asserted ("the council would disapprove") rather than dramatized on the page. The renaming ritual unfolds as a sequence of gestures without meaningful resistance or tightening; Elara encounters no friction between touching the tessera and completing the act, flattening causality into a checklist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shattered kaleidoscope sky and mosaic stepping stones are vivid and present throughout. The tessera's cobalt blue and the chipped patterns anchor tactile engagement. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; the mosaic stepping stone enables the renaming but does not constrain Elara's choices or force her to adapt tactics. The setting charges the final image ("seemed to glow") but does not alter her path, keeping it just below the 7.0 gate for choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redefining mercy—is signaled early but never tested by opposition. Elara kneels, traces patterns, places the tessera, speaks the name; no reversal narrows her options. The council's potential disapproval is mentioned in reflection but never appears on the page to complicate her act. "Warm coldness" and "aberrant mercy" are invoked as concepts rather than pressures that force a trade-off, leaving escalation flat and cost abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of merciful strength emerges through the renaming ritual and the metaphor of cradling empathy in steel. However, the final paragraph ("merciful strength," "empathy guarded by unwavering principles") states the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The new word "Khalish" is defined explicitly ("sheltered strength") instead of letting the reader infer meaning from context. Elara's act would carry more weight if the consequences—council reaction, personal cost—were dramatized rather than reflected upon as potential futures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Narration maintains stable third-person limited focus on Elara. Psychic distance is consistent, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("aberrant mercy," "renaming mercy itself") that feels prompted rather than organic to her interior voice. No dialogue appears, so conversational tests are inapplicable. The prose conveys her perceptual priorities (mosaic patterns, retrocognitive visions) but recycles conceptual phrases ("warm coldness," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") across multiple paragraphs without variation, flattening voice specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops recur throughout: "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" appears three times, "warm coldness" twice, "aberrant mercy" four times. These conceptual phrases are restated rather than developed, creating synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in mid-story beats: "She [verb], [gerund]..." structures repeat across adjacent paragraphs. The final third summarizes outcomes ("The council would disapprove," "everything had been labeled," "retrocognitive traps faded") rather than dramatizing them, diluting momentum and information density at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—renaming mercy via mosaic ritual—offers a fresh frame. However, execution leans on prompt-driven labels ("gentle radical," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") that read as checklist fulfillment rather than organic synthesis. The renaming proceeds without friction or surprise; the new word "Khalish" is explained rather than discovered through resistant material. Elara's journey lacks the specific, non-obvious inflection that would make the premise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and labeled "gentle radical" repeatedly, but her radicalism is asserted rather than tested. She advocates compassion and performs the renaming without encountering opposition that forces her to choose between gentleness and radical action. Her stance shapes the thematic frame but does not create a key turn; the story would read largely the same if she were simply "a reformer" or "an advocate."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tessera appears early (paragraph 4), triggers retrocognitive visions mid-story, and is placed into the stepping stone near the climax. It is handled in three distinct beats and enables the final act. However, its properties are told ("made her retrocognitively trapped") rather than discovered through failed attempts or visible cost, and it "clicked into place" without resistance, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named six times but functions as a thematic label rather than a stake that alters Elara's tactics. The text tells us her act is aberrant and merciful, yet the on-page action—kneeling, tracing, placing, speaking—proceeds without moral friction or a moment where mercy conflicts with another value. The concept echoes in reflection but does not constrain or enable a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trait is introduced early and mentioned in three beats (paragraphs 5, 12, 13, 31). Elara "fought" the visions by focusing on the present stone, but this struggle is summarized in one line without dramatized cost—no moment where the trap delays her, forces her to abandon a tool, or risks the ritual. The trait decorates her experience rather than imposing a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The act of renaming structures the entire story: Elara seeks the name, traces patterns to find it, speaks it aloud, and the world shifts. The renaming is signaled early, developed through ritual beats, and completes the closure. Its specificity—naming not the plaza but the concept of mercy—drives the thematic turn. However, the act proceeds without resistance or failed attempts, limiting its causal pressure and keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic stepping stone is introduced in paragraph 2, handled directly in paragraphs 7–8 and 14, and returns in the closure as glowing with the new name. Elara traces the patterns to decode the name, making the method integral to the renaming. However, the mechanics are vague—how do chips encode syllables?—and the method does not resist her or force adaptation, so it shapes one key turn but remains somewhat interchangeable with other ritual objects.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient plaza and shattered sky anchor every scene and charge the final image ("seemed to soften"). The setting provides the mosaic stepping stone and tessera, enabling the ritual. However, the environment does not pressure Elara's choices; she encounters no rival in the plaza, no council enforcer, no weather or spatial constraint that alters her tactics. The setting is essential for atmosphere and ending resonance but does not force a mid-story adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the great fire" frames the world's post-catastrophe state and appears in the opening, middle reflection, and closure paragraph. It establishes context but does not tighten Elara's decisions—no ticking clock, no rival arriving, no fire-related threat that forces her to hurry or improvise. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure, limiting its integration to thematic coloring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated explicitly three times and drives Elara's intent to redefine mercy. It frames her goal and the final thematic claim. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—no moment where protecting empathy costs her something immediate or where steel-like resolve clashes with her gentle nature in a live choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is named twice and invoked in the final line. It gestures toward a paradoxical tone—compassion within unyielding structure—but is delivered as a label rather than felt through contradictory sensory or emotional detail. The prose does not modulate between warmth and coldness in response to pressure; instead it maintains a steady, elevated philosophical register, making the tone concept ornamental rather than embedded in rhythm and image.</comment>
