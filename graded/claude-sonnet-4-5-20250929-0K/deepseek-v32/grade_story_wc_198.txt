<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clearly established (hushing a prophecy through saxophone whispers) and his actions trace a coherent arc from plaza to grotto. The interiority remains abstract in key moments—"poured his breath into the horn, his own memories of quiet mornings and soft rains flowing into the music"—relying on stock phrasing rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice (playing the sustained whisper) feels mechanically seeded rather than earned through visible internal conflict, and the cost remains implied rather than embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Leo moves from plaza to atrium to grotto, each location deepening the pattern of structured silence. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the prophecy is "hushed, not broken, lulled back into its silent code"), and the cost is legible—the "eerie nostalgia" and "haunting for the silence he protected" charge the final image. However, the decisive whisper feels summary-told rather than dramatized in the moment, and the grotto resolution lacks a final sensory beat that would anchor the reweighting with full immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is purposeful and specific: the Prism Atrium's mist-diffused light, the mosaic of a silent open mouth, the grotto's crystalline ceiling with tree roots all constrain Leo's path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations. The "quietly vivid" glow and "radiant grotto" both appear in closure, elevating atmospheric detail to functional pressure. Minor deduction: the dewdrops on gates and the forming dewdrops at closure are mentioned but not shown altering a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy before cacophony shatters the world's stillness—is signaled early and tightens once when Leo descends to the grotto and the thrumming code accelerates. The crystal's glow and projected images create a visible turn, and Leo's saxophone whisper forecloses the noise with on-page consequence. However, the escalation is compression-driven rather than choice-driven: no live dilemma forces Leo to trade one cost for another, and the resolution feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as both imposed hush and earned peace—emerges through concrete images: the "vested hush," the structured pauses, the grotto's natural calm versus the city's enforced quiet. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Leo carries the "radiant grotto" within, and "eerie nostalgia" reweights the opening tension. The piece resists tidy binaries. Minor slip: "reminding it of peace" in the climax edges toward abstraction, and the grandmother's radio-signal prophecy remains a convenient backstory device rather than a fully integrated thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Leo's perceptual signature—listening through negative space, focusing on intervals—is character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric: "dewdrops formed on the wrought-iron gates, each bead a tiny, trembling lens." However, elevated register occasionally drifts from Leo's plausible lexicon under peak stress: "perpetually shrouded," "fractured by crystal and vapor into spectral ribbons" feel authorial rather than focalizer-native. No head-hopping, and the narrative distance supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful in world-building beats: "mist pooled on the floor, and light from the atrium above filtered down, fractured by crystal and vapor into spectral ribbons." However, scaffold and template cadence appear in mid-story: "He played for the quiet, for the 'vested hush'…a silence that felt owned and enforced, not peaceful" and "The prophecy wasn't in the sounds, but in the structured silence between them, a pattern of pauses like a musical rest" loop similar constructions. Filter-verb stacks in the grotto ("poured his breath," "flowing into the music," "reminding it") dull immediacy at the climax. Information density is high, but figurative language ("quietly vivid," "eerie nostalgia," "vested hush") recurs without evolving pressure, triggering a density check deduction of −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—saxophonist countering a sonic prophecy through negative space—offers a fresh angle on sound-as-magic. The grotto's crystalline architecture and the code acceleration create specific, non-generic texture. However, the core arc (hero descends, performs ritual, restores balance) follows template fantasy structure without transformation, and the grandmother's prophecy remains a convenient inherited quest rather than a synthesis rooted in Leo's lived contradiction. The "whisper" action and "negative space" method feel thematically declared more than dramatized through irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo is present across all three locations and makes the key choices: entering the atrium, descending to the grotto, playing the sustained whisper. His agency drives the arc. However, the choices feel procedural rather than dilemma-laden—he knows where to go and what to do without visible cost or tactical adaptation. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development is compliant but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium anchors two beats: Leo enters and listens to the jagged silence; later he emerges after the grotto resolution, and the mist "was just brightening with day." The "perpetually shrouded" dome and "quietly vivid glow" charge the atmospheric closure. All three gates met; the atrium constrains Leo's path and reappears with reweighted meaning at the end. Strong integration, though the final beat is brief.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vested hush" is defined early ("a silence that felt owned and enforced, not peaceful") and returns at closure when the grotto's hush becomes "earned, natural, not imposed." It shapes the dominant stake and charges the thematic resolution. However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint—it doesn't force a visible choice with cost. Setup and payoff present; middle use is atmospheric only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears twice as descriptive label: the atrium's glow and the grotto's "heart of the world's hush." It enriches atmosphere but does not constrain or enable any action with visible cost. The attribute is ornamental—swappable with "soft," "diffused," or "muted" without altering Leo's choices. No gates met beyond setup mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whisper is signaled in the title phrase "action: whisper" and dramatized at the climax: "the sound was so soft it was barely a breath, a true whisper woven from brass and intent. It slid into the core frequency of the thrumming prophecy. The code fractured." This action resolves the prophecy and is irreplaceable—no other instrument move would carry the same thematic weight. All three gates met; the whisper drives closure. Slight deduction: the decisive moment feels summary-compressed rather than beat-by-beat immediate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Through negative space" is introduced early (Leo listens "through negative space, focusing on the intervals") and returns at closure ("He had woven stillness back into the fabric of this place, 'through negative space,' using the gaps as both map and remedy"). The method shapes Leo's tactic in the grotto—playing notes into the gaps—but the mechanics remain abstract. Setup and payoff present; middle beat shows application but not visible cost or adaptation when the method fails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radiant grotto anchors the climax: its crystalline ceiling, mist-pooled floor, and natural spire provide the stage for Leo's whisper and the prophecy's fracture. The grotto supplies the crystal that glows and projects images, shaping the outcome. At closure, Leo "carried the 'radiant grotto' within him," reweighting the setting as internal resource. All three gates met; the grotto is indispensable to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"As dewdrops form" appears in the opening (dewdrops on gates) and closing (forming dewdrops in the calm mist), bracketing the narrative. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Leo's journey proceeds without a live clock. The dewdrops mark mood and lyric closure but do not constrain tactics. Setup and payoff present; no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Leo's motivation—"to hush a prophecy spoken in code"—is established early and drives every beat: he plays in the plaza, enters the atrium to perceive the code, descends to the grotto to counter-whisper. The prophecy's acceleration (pauses shortening, thrumming rising) creates urgency. All three gates met. However, the motivation is inherited and declarative rather than internally conflicted; Leo never weighs a competing want or cost on the page, lowering friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Eerie nostalgia" is named twice—once in the atrium's atmosphere, once at closure: "The eerie nostalgia remained, a haunting for the silence he protected, a memory of a future noise that never came." The tone modulates from tense (jagged pauses, rising thrumming) to calm (gentle pulse, still-sleeping house), coherent with pressure shifts. The final image charges the tone with conceptual cost. All three gates met; the tone is integral to thematic resonance.</comment>
