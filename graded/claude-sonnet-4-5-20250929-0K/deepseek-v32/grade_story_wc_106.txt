<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to press your ear against destiny's door") but remains abstract throughout. The guard encounter shows some micro-choice work (switching portraits), but the epiphany moment ("Was she a thief, or a curator of light?") arrives as unearned therapy-speak rather than embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is told rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses. The final "open hand" shift lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (emerald station, golden hour, portrait theft) adequately and follows a Causal lens through the guard encounter. However, the closure unit—Elara's realization that she should "listen with an open hand"—is a conceptual claim rather than a decisive change with on-page cost. The moonbeam jar's reaction ("the sound was different, clearer") is asserted, not demonstrated through altered options or visible sacrifice. The seven-minute window and flower-code mechanics are mentioned but don't constrain the actual heist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald station and golden-hour sunset provide vivid sensory anchors ("green-veined marble floors," "sun-drenched field"). However, spatial choreography in the waiting room is vague—pillar placement, guard distance, and Elara's movement lack clear blocking. The moonbeam jar functions as a micro-setting object that enables the forgery switch, satisfying the constraint test. Tone-supporting details (bronze pot, brown paper) are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stealing the portrait without capture) is signaled early and tightens when the guard appears. The moonbeam distraction creates one meaningful reversal that narrows options. However, the seven-minute window is declared but never tracked or pressured—no countdown alters tactics. The "shared moment" with the guard resolves the confrontation without visible cost; Elara simply switches portraits while he's entranced, with no trade-off or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of moments versus possession emerges through the portrait's glow and Elara's final reflection. However, the ending explicitly states the thematic question ("Was she a thief, or a curator of light?") rather than answering it through image and action. The phrase "press your ear against destiny's door" recurs as a prompt-echo label without accumulating new meaning. The moonbeam jar's "musical hum" at closure is told, not rendered as a charged image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature ("quietly savvy," knowledge of blind spots) establishes character-specific noticing. However, elevated diction ("luminous disbelief," "lanced out") clashes with practical-thief framing in peak beats. The guard's dialogue ("his own fondness for the golden hour") is functional but generic. Psychic distance widens inappropriately during the climax when "a plan formed" tells rather than shows tactical thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "codes in flower arrangements seemed less like commands and more like invitations" restates the earlier epiphany without new pressure. Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("melted back into the shadows") and therapy-speak labels ("quietly savvy nature," "genuine illuminated moment") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing Elara's shift, violating the show-don't-tell test at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The golden-hour portrait thief premise and moonbeam jar offer a fresh fantastical angle. However, the flower-code communication and distraction-by-beauty beats follow familiar heist patterns without transformation. The ending's "thief versus curator" realization is a common arcTemplate (criminal-to-guardian) executed without a non-obvious inflection. Proximity check: "pressed your ear against destiny's door" reads as prompt language inserted verbatim rather than organically integrated idiom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and makes the key choice to switch portraits. However, her decisions are reactive (responding to the guard) rather than creating turns. The final epiphany is told, not enacted through a choice that alters tactics or cost. Present in setup, middle confrontation, and ending reflection, but the ending choice (walking away with resolve) does not fundamentally break if Elara were a different type of thief.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonbeam jar appears in three beats: carried in the satchel, used to project the portrait's glow, and opened again at the end when its hum changes. It enables the forgery switch (causal pressure) and returns with reweighted meaning (the altered tone). However, the jar's mechanics are asserted rather than constrained—it solves the guard problem conveniently without prior cost or limitation established.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" frames the thief's target (portraits capturing joy) and recurs in the ending epiphany. However, it functions primarily as thematic claim rather than shaping on-page stakes. The concept does not constrain tactics or alter options during the heist; Elara's method (distraction, forgery) would work identically if she stole for monetary value. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" is mentioned twice: once in exposition ("her quietly savvy nature had prepared her") and once during the guard encounter. It appears as a label rather than constraining action. The trait does not create a visible trade-off—Elara's knowledge of blind spots and rotations is told but never tested against a cost or mistake on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reinterpret" appears twice: Elara wonders if she misread the flower code, then realizes she must "reinterpret not just codes, but her entire purpose." The first use does not alter her tactics (she proceeds with the heist regardless). The second is the ending epiphany, but the action itself is swappable with "reconsider" or "rethink" without structural impact. Mid-band for modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The flower arrangement communicates the portrait's location and the seven-minute all-clear window. Signaled early (setup gate met), but the code's mechanics do not constrain the heist—the seven minutes are never tracked, and Elara's doubt about misreading the signal does not change her approach. Functional but replaceable; a simple note or overheard conversation would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The emerald station anchors the opening and provides marble floors, a west waiting room, and a platform. "By moonlight" appears in the final third when the sunset vanishes. The setting supplies the pillar where the portrait leans (micro-setting enabling discovery) but does not pressure Elara's choices—the heist could occur in any gallery or depot with minor edits. Present across setup and ending; modest causal role via the pillar.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The golden sunset is vivid in the opening ("fleeting," "dying fast") and vanishes before the ending, replaced by moonlight. The timeframe creates urgency in exposition ("She had to move now") but does not constrain on-page action—no countdown alters Elara's tactics during the guard encounter. The seven-minute window is declared but never tracked. Functional setup without development or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To press your ear against destiny's door" is stated twice: in the flower-code paragraph and again when Elara listens to the jar's hum. The motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice shows Elara sacrificing safety or gain to pursue this abstract desire. The phrase recurs verbatim as a label without accumulating cost or friction. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" describes the guard's reaction and mirrors Elara's epiphany. The tone is coherent (wonder, silver light, magical realism) and modulates from urgency (heist pressure) to contemplation (ending reflection). However, the tone does not charge the final image with cost—the "silver-lit night" is descriptive rather than reconfiguring prior stakes. Present across beats; modest resonance at closure.</comment>
