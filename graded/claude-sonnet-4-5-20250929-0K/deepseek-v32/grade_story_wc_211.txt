<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to archive emotional patterns is stated but never tested under pressure; his "urgent, personal significance" remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The decision to "create a new oath" in the final third feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy. Interiority leans heavily on label-only constructions ("velvet disquiet," "dread and realization") without showing competing desires act simultaneously in scene. The closure stance—embedding prophecy in dead languages—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the prophecy fragments accumulate density through repeated immersion beats, and the ending reconfigures Aris's archival task into prophetic preservation. However, closure cost remains conceptual and oblique—"hope amidst uncertainty" is told rather than shown in a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The causal linkage from discovering prophecy to creating a new oath compresses without depicting the intervening choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper functions as both setting and symbolic fulcrum when Aris realizes "this place be the tower from the prophecy." The wax shaving and phonograph apparatus constrain the immersion method and return with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective—mist, elevated haze, unripe fruit—and filtered through Aris's archival priorities. The garden's specificity charges the final image sufficiently to meet the 9+ gate, though the "invisible sea" and "post-foghorn silence" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns versus averting prophesied disaster—is signaled early but escalation remains largely internal and reflective. The single on-page tightening occurs when Aris recognizes the prophecy's alignment with his setting, yet this realization does not narrow tactical options or force a visible trade-off; instead he resolves to "create a new oath" without dramatized cost. No reversal tests prior commitment; the prophecy emerges from a memory rather than protagonist agency. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the shift is conceptual but not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation against entropy, accidental fate versus agency—emerges from the orchard, wax cylinder, and prophecy particulars rather than direct statement. The final image of Aris speaking into the machine to "archive the emotional pattern of hope" gestures toward a non-literal answer but edges close to thematic summary ("hope amidst uncertainty"). The wax shaving as fragile carrier of prophecy offers thematic resonance, yet the ending articulates the thesis ("purpose, a velvet disquiet shaping into action") rather than leaving it implicit in a charged scene beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Aris's perceptual signature—attuned to "emotional patterns," "sonic texture," "tremors in speech"—remains consistent and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to persistence against time") that feels more authorial than scribe-particular. The phonograph immersion beats are legible and purposeful, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("velvet disquiet shaping into action") weakens voice specificity. No dialogue appears; internal voice remains coherent with minor register slips under peak reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Information density is moderate; many sentences restate concepts (e.g., "velvet disquiet" appears four times; "emotional patterns" recurs without added texture). Template cadence runs through the middle third: "He was a child again... He had missed this... He immersed deeper... He replayed... He spoke... He resolved... He stored... He recalled... He decided..." Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines: "The prophecy was unintentional... Yet it resonated... Could this place be the tower?" The final paragraph stacks summary moves that dull momentum. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; no artifacts directly obscure the closure beat, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination—oath scribe, wax cylinder phonograph, dead languages, accidental prophecy in a child's memory—offers a non-obvious synthesis. The orchard atop a skyscraper as "silent tower bearing fruit" provides a fresh spatial twist. However, the emotional arc (archivist discovers prophecy, resolves to preserve and warn) follows a familiar template; swapping names and setting would leave the structure largely intact. The turn from passive archiving to active oath-making is signaled but not deeply earned through prior contradiction or cost, keeping the piece in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's choices—selecting the shaving, replaying it, resolving to create a new oath—are present across setup, middle, and ending. However, the final choice lacks on-page cost; "began his new work" is declared rather than shown altering tactics or foreclosing a path. Beat involvement spans three moments, but causal pressure is moderate and the closure linkage is summary-level.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wax cylinder shaving is introduced early, used in the immersion beat, replayed for further clues, stored carefully, and readied at closure to record the new oath. It appears in four distinct beats, constrains the method of immersion, and charges the final image as the medium for preservation. Specificity is high—"grooved wax," "sliver," "fragile"—and its properties matter causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The accidental prophecy is discovered in the middle third, reweights Aris's stakes from archival to urgent personal significance, and shapes his final decision to embed the prophecy for future scribes. It drives two beats (discovery, realization of setting alignment) and participates in closure. However, the prophecy emerges coincidentally from the memory rather than from Aris's prior choices, and the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes how the concept constrains his tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Speaking dead languages is introduced early as "essential for decoding" and enables Aris to hear the Sumerian phrase the children recite. This trait unlocks one key turn—recognizing the prophecy—but does not constrain later action with visible tradeoff. The final beat mentions translating into "every dead language," but this is told rather than shown. Present in setup and closure, but mid-development causal role is singular and swappable (any esoteric skill could serve).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Immerse" is signaled early, drives the phonograph beat where the prophecy is discovered, recurs when Aris "immersed deeper" and "immersed himself once more in his own memories," and frames the closure as he prepares to record. The action is specific to the wax-cylinder method and appears in three beats, shaping the discovery and final choice. However, the mechanics remain consistent without escalating constraint, and the final "immerse" is more metaphorical than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory is introduced in the setup, used as the vehicle for immersion in the discovery beat, and recalled at closure when Aris reflects on "the method of immersion via the third-grade field trip memory." It shapes the discovery and participates in the ending's conceptual reconfiguration. However, the memory's "curious" quality and its specific mechanics (why this memory? why an elderly teacher's recording?) are underexplored, leaving the method somewhat interchangeable with any archived memory.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper is anchored in the opening, becomes the "silent tower bearing fruit" that Aris recognizes as the prophecy's referent in the middle third, and returns in the closing lines as a "testament to persistence" where the new oath begins. It drives one key turn (prophecy realization) and charges the final image. The setting constrains Aris's spatial position and supplies thematic weight, though it does not alter tactics in a micro-concrete way.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the foghorn fell silent" is established in the opening line and recurs as symbolic bookend in the final third ("The silence after the foghorn was now filled with purpose"). It frames the story's before/after and contributes to tone, but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters moves. Dawn's approach is mentioned once without pressing urgency. The timeframe is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to archive emotional patterns is stated in the third paragraph, drives his nightly work and immersion method, and shifts to "urgent, personal significance" when the prophecy emerges. The final beat returns to archiving—now "the emotional pattern of hope amidst uncertainty." The desire is present across setup, middle, and closure, but friction between archival duty and prophetic action is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is introduced in paragraph four, recurs four times across the middle beats, and reappears in the penultimate paragraph as "shaping into action." The tone modulates from "soft, persistent unease" to "palpable force" and finally to purpose-driven charge, supporting the accumulative pressure. However, the phrase itself becomes a repeated label rather than evolving through sensory or rhythmic shift, and the final use ("velvet disquiet shaping into action") reads as summary rather than embodied modulation.</comment>
