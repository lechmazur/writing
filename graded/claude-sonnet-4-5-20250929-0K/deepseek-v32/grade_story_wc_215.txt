<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through observation and label ("tranquilly perceptive," "astonished") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation to preserve "the weight of unspoken words" remains abstract until the final third, when he begins tending lavender—a choice that feels more thematic than causally earned by prior internal conflict. The ghosts function as atmospheric pressure rather than relational crucible, leaving his interiority underdeveloped. Embodied emotion is sparse; most affective states are told ("astonishment," "quiet satisfaction") without bodily texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (ghosts, stained glass box, lavender) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Elias, oasis, post-Event world) arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from astonished observer to active participant, and the oasis revives. However, the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off charges the final image. The transition from observation to action occurs off-stage in summary ("He began to tend"), weakening causal linkage. Closure lands but without sharp felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oasis setting is vivid and specific: bleached hives, lavender fields, deep well, scorched wasteland. These details constrain Elias's actions (watering from the well, tending dormant plants) and the stained glass box functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; tactile and olfactory cues (honey scent, heat shimmer) appear but do not evolve under pressure. The setting participates in closure—new shoots, blooming lavender—earning solid integration, though spatial choreography remains static across most beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renewal of the covenant through action—is signaled by midpoint but remains abstract until Elias begins watering. No on-page tightening occurs; the ghost's gesture prompts Elias, but we do not witness a decision point or trade-off. The oasis responds passively to his work without setback or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift; here the beats loop (ghosts watch, plants revive, box glows) without escalation. The resolution—ghosts fade, oasis thrives—arrives without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (covenant, care, unspoken legacy) emerges from images rather than statement, and the stained glass box serves as a non-literal emblem. However, "the weight of unspoken words" and "mute eloquence" are repeated as labels rather than earned through specific sensory or relational friction. The final image—sunset painting the box, oasis blooming—offers resonance but feels declarative: "some truths are best preserved without speech" approaches sermon. Subtext in the ghosts' silent approval and Elias's contextual learning is present but underdeveloped; the piece tells its theme more than it enacts it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Distance control is clean, though perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices what the plot requires (ghosts, box, hives) without idiosyncratic filtering. Vocabulary remains consistent but elevated in register: "mute eloquence," "tangled covenant," "luminous panels" read as authorial rather than character-particular. Rhythm is uniform across beats; syntactic variety is low, with many sentences opening on subject-verb. No dialogue appears. Compression and elision serve the Accumulative mode, but voice lacks the specificity needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "astonished," "weight of unspoken words," "mute eloquence," "tranquilly perceptive," "stained glass box," and "tangled covenant" recur across dozens of lines without reweighting. Sentences frequently echo prior content ("The ghosts began to fade... But their mute eloquence remained"). Stock metaphors ("green defiance," "silent conversation") and filter-verb stacks ("observed," "felt," "realized," "knew") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many beats summarize rather than dramatize. Figurative language ("shimmering," "flickering," "glowing") appears in most lines without pattern-teaching. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template cadence; artifacts touch closure ("some truths are best preserved without speech").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—visible ghosts prompting a recluse to renew an ecological covenant—offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic, ghostly, and pastoral material. However, execution relies on stock moves: the wise hermit, the mystical object, the land responding to care. Emotional beats are generic (astonishment → understanding → satisfaction) and lack the specificity or moral calculus that would transform the trope. The covenant's mechanics and Elias's internal stakes remain abstract. Proximity check: "weight of unspoken words" and "mute eloquence" echo familiar literary phrasing without distinct transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias ("astonished recluse") appears in nearly every beat and frames the POV. However, his astonishment is label-only; he observes ghosts "with a tranquilly perceptive nature, never fleeing" but does not make a visible choice until late ("He began to tend"). That decision arrives in summary and is not contested. The character is present across setup, middle, and ending, but his agency is passive. No cost or trade-off is tied to his reclusive astonishment. Functional but replaceable with a generic observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in setup ("center of the oasis"), middle (Elias sits before it, ghost points to it), and ending (glows brighter, painted by sunset). It accumulates symbolic weight as testament to the covenant and participates in closure's visual charge. However, it is never handled or used in distinct physical beats—only gazed upon and described. Removing it would weaken thematic resonance but not break plot logic. Strong lyric reprise but no causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tangled covenant" is named early and explained (mutual care between land and keepers). It shapes Elias's motivation to renew the bond and structures the middle investigation (contextual clues, ghost gestures). The ending resolves it ("now untangled"). However, the covenant remains abstract; we do not see its terms tested or Elias forced to choose between competing obligations. It frames stakes but does not constrain tactics. Present across all three gates with thematic integration but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is mentioned twice as a label ("tranquilly perceptive nature," "His tranquilly perceptive mind") and once in closing summary. It describes Elias's method (observing ghosts, absorbing techniques) but does not enable or constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. No trade-off between tranquility and urgency appears. The trait supports tone but lacks causal force. Setup and middle mentions; no closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs frequently: Elias's gaze is "fixed on luminous panels," he gazes upon lavender "with quiet satisfaction," and the closing image shows his "gaze softened." It signals his observer stance and bookends the arc. However, gazing itself does not create turns; the decisive action is watering and tending, not looking. The gaze charges the final image but is easily swappable with "watched" or "observed." Present in setup and ending; mid-scene function is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" appears as method in multiple beats: Elias pieces together history, decodes the story, deciphers balance, and learns techniques from ghosts' movements. It shapes his investigative tactics and ties to his perceptive attribute. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not witness a specific clue reweighting his understanding or altering a choice. The method is present across setup, middle, and ending but functions as narrative summary rather than causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" anchors every beat. The bleached hives, dormant lavender, deep well, and wasteland boundary constrain Elias's actions: he waters from the well, tends specific plants, and revives the space. The setting's decay and revival drive the arc. New shoots and blooming lavender participate directly in closure. The oasis is irreplaceable—remove it and both plot and theme collapse. Strong integration across all gates with causal and thematic necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the Event, when ghosts became visible" is established in setup and defines the story's present reality. The ghosts' visibility enables Elias's learning and their fading at the end marks resolution. However, the timeframe itself (post-Event) does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elias has lived with ghosts for an indeterminate period and acts when prompted, not under time pressure. The frame enables the premise but does not escalate tactics. Present across all gates; participates in closure (ghosts dissolve) but lacks live-clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" is declared early as Elias's motivation and recurs as thematic refrain. It drives his decision to safeguard the box and tend the oasis, and the closing image reaffirms it ("some truths are best preserved without speech"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible sacrifice. No friction between preservation and another want appears. Present in setup, middle, and ending; thematically integrated but lacks on-page cost or internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" as tone is signaled early (ghosts' silent presence, unspoken regrets) and sustained through imagery of silence, gesture, and implication. The phrase recurs across beats and charges the final line ("in that tranquilly perceptive silence, the abandoned beekeeping oasis found its voice again"). Tone remains coherent and modulates subtly as ghosts fade and plants revive. However, "mute eloquence" as a label is over-applied (four explicit mentions), reducing felt resonance. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage; tone supports the ending but is stated more than embodied.</comment>
