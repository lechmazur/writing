<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Father Aris's motivation (to illuminate hidden assumptions) is established but remains abstract; the "possession relies on belief that a soul could be wholly displaced" insight arrives via authorial summary rather than embodied discovery. Micro-choices exist (tapping pedal, drawing circle) but interiority defaults to exposition: "His motivation was pure: to illuminate hidden assumptions..." reads like a frame rather than lived contradiction. Kael remains a passive vessel; no internal conflict shapes the exorcism. The final "clear and his own" relies on telling rather than a dramatized shift in agency or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change (possession halted, Kael's eyes clear), and orientation anchors early (chamber, priest, initiate). However, the escalation is thin: Aris layers sound without meaningful resistance or tactical adjustment; the entity "wavered" off-page with no on-page struggle. Cost is asserted ("the hidden had been revealed") but not felt—no visible trade-off, injury, or foreclosed path. The inferred lens is Causal but linkage is weak: why does layered silence plus one blue circle defeat the entity? The mechanism remains opaque, undercutting closure necessity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor (spherical chamber, worn stone, cables, humming power) anchors spatially, and the palette's single blue pigment returns at closure (drawn on forehead, pulses, absorbs alien light). Tone ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness") is coherent but static; no sensory modulation tracks rising pressure. The loop pedal cables "snaking into the floor" hint at constraint but never limit a tactic. Spatial choreography is minimal (Aris at center, Kael nearby) and the blue circle charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save Kael before possession completes) is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. Aris's actions—tap pedal, layer silence, draw circle, add breath—accumulate without resistance or cost; the entity's "wavered" response is told, not shown. No reversal, no on-page price (stamina, error, sacrifice), no tactical shift when something fails. The timeframe ("bleeding away") is declared urgent but never constrains a choice. Agency is present (Aris acts) but the escalation is flat, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (coexistence of self vs. displacement, hidden assumptions about possession) emerges from the conflict but is over-articulated: "the possession relied on the belief that a soul could be wholly displaced" is thesis-speak, not embodied insight. The blue pigment and looped silence work as motifs tied to the stakes, and the final "woven back into peace" offers quiet resonance. However, "in muffled clarity, the hidden had been revealed" moralizes rather than letting the image speak. Subtext is thin; rhetorical devices (chiasmus, epistrophe) are named but feel ornamental rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Aris's focus on sound layers, silence as vessel) is character-specific. Distance control is clean, and the spoken lines ("Silence is not empty. It is a vessel.") carry voice. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("aporia," "hypophora," "epithet") that reads more like academic catalog than a priest's working thought under pressure. The loop pedal mechanics are legible, but the rhetorical-device labeling intrudes on immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is strong; no spatial confusion or pronoun ambiguity. Information density is moderate: "unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity," "abyssal blue" do double duty as tone and image. However, paraphrase loops appear: "unraveled stillness" recurs without added pressure, "muffled clarity" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems repeat across beats ("He tapped," "He decorated," "He dipped," "He plumbed," "He added," "He powered down"). Stock phrasing: "the hidden had been revealed" is boilerplate resolution. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (−0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for stock closure phrasing) totaling roughly −0.9, routing score to low 6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest in a dimensional exorcism offers a fresh synthesis (sonic ritual + metaphysical possession). Rhetorical devices as method and single-color palette are specific touches. However, the emotional arc (Aris never doubts, entity folds without dramatized struggle) lacks complexity, and the resolution hinges on an unexplained rule (why does layered silence + blue circle work?). The piece commits to its premise but stops short of transforming the exorcism template with non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost. Risk-taking is present but execution remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest is present throughout (taps pedal, layers silence, dips pigment, powers down) and drives all major beats. His decisions (what to layer, when to draw the circle, final breath loop) shape the exorcism. However, internal conflict is thin; no micro-choice reveals trade-off or doubt. The priest's method is enacted but never tested by failure or adaptation. Two-of-three gates met (setup, middle beats, ending); causal pressure is moderate; swappability is low (the loop pedal mechanic is specific). Scores solidly in the 6–7 band but lacks the cost/specificity for higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Artist's palette with one color appears early (altar, abyssal blue pigment) and returns in two beats: Aris dips his finger, draws circle on Kael's forehead; the blue pulses and absorbs alien light at closure; final line notes "its purpose served." The blue functions as focus and beacon. However, causal pressure is thin—why this color? The palette itself is static description; the pigment does work but could be swapped for another mystical substance. Two gates met (setup, closure); one distinct middle beat; moderate irreplaceability. Scores mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Unraveled stillness is named three times ("unraveled stillness," "quiet grew dense," "unraveled stillness now woven back") but operates primarily as atmosphere rather than stake-shaping constraint. It frames the ritual but does not alter Aris's options or tactics on the page. The concept appears in setup and closure (lyric reprise) but middle development is absent—no choice hinges on "unraveling" versus "weaving." Functional but ornamental; swappable with "fragile calm" or similar. Scores low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Decorates with silence is Aris's primary method: "layering absence upon absence," "dense and tangible...protective shroud," "decorated with one more blanket of silence." The trait enables multiple beats (pedal use, silence as vessel, final epithet) and shapes his approach to the exorcism. However, no visible trade-off—when does silence fail or cost him something? The attribute is specific but not constraining; it describes his tactic without forcing a choice under pressure. Two gates met (setup, middle, closure); causal work is moderate. Scores mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plumb appears in three contexts: "plumb the depths of that void," "plumbing the anchor's psychic resonance," "He plumbed deeper, his mental inquiries shaped by hypophora." The action drives middle escalation (seeking weak point, deepening inquiry) and connects to closure (entity's pressure wavers). However, the mechanics remain vague—what does "plumbing" entail beyond metaphor? Swappable with "probe" or "reach into" with minor edits. Two-to-three gates met; causal role is present but abstract. Scores mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Through rhetorical devices is named explicitly: "chiasmus," "epistrophe," "hypophora," "epithet." The method appears in setup ("through rhetorical devices like this chiasmus") and middle beats (repeating phrases, posing silent questions) but feels label-only. The devices are told rather than dramatized—why does epistrophe counter the entity? No visible cost or failure tied to the method. Swappable with "incantations" or "structured prayers." Two gates met (setup, middle); causal pressure is weak. Scores low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor frames the entire scene (spherical chamber, worn stone, humming power, cables) and responds to Aris's work ("hum shifted," "hum settled into new frequency"). The setting is present in setup, middle, and closure, and its "psychic resonance" is the terrain Aris navigates. However, the anchor never constrains a choice—no access limit, no environmental hazard. It's backdrop more than pressure. Three gates met; moderate specificity; low causal constraint. Scores low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Before the possession completes is stated in opening ("before the possession completed, before the entity...fully claimed the initiate") and recurs ("Time was bleeding away," "internal struggle," "possession halted, incomplete"). The timeframe creates urgency in principle but never tightens a decision—Aris works methodically without racing the clock. Kael's twitching is a symptom, not a countdown that alters tactics. Two gates met (setup, closure mentioned); pressure is declared but not dramatized. Scores mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To illuminate hidden assumptions is declared in opening ("His motivation was pure: to illuminate hidden assumptions...") and restated in middle ("the hidden assumption laid bare") and closure ("the hidden had been revealed"). The motivation frames the ritual but is told, not dramatized—when does Aris wrestle with doubt or cost tied to this goal? No friction between wanting to save Kael versus proving a thesis. Present in three beats but purely expository. Two-to-three gates met; weak dramatization; high swappability. Scores low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Muffled clarity appears in opening ("tone...one of muffled clarity, as if a thick veil lay over a brilliant light") and closing ("In muffled clarity, the hidden had been revealed"). The tone is consistent (quiet, dense, shrouded yet illuminated) and modulates subtly as the anchor hums and settles. However, the reprise in the final line risks moralizing rather than image. The tone charges atmosphere but does not shift with pressure peaks. Purposeful lyric reprise (first → last) reweights meaning; two gates met (setup, closure). Scores low 6s.</comment>
