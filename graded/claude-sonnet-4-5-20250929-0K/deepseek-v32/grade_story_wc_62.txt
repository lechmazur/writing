<comment>Elm's motivation is clear and his arc from paralysis to clarity is coherent, but the transformation leans heavily on Silas's guidance rather than Elm's own contradictory impulses in scene. The epiphany—grief as tapestry not monument—arrives through exposition ("Grief is not a solitary shape") rather than embodied struggle. Internal conflict is more sequential than simultaneous: he moves from stillness to reading to drawing without visible cost or friction between competing desires. The final choice feels inevitable but is narrated more than dramatized, reducing agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of family voices reweights the dominant stake). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elm's discovery of grief as "weave, not wound" shifts his creative stance with felt cost (abandoning his prior isolating method). The escalation through reading poems deepens understanding via density increase, satisfying the lens. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse, Elm, dusk, butterfly migration). One persistent issue: the spectral mentor delivers the key insight ("The crack was not in the stone…") rather than Elm earning it through dramatized missteps, which softens causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse at dusk is vivid and purposeful: "cracked panes," "dead vines," "mossy bench" anchor the scene and the butterfly migration creates both atmosphere and thematic parallel. The ribbon roll functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (Elm must physically unroll it, touch the scrolls) and charging the final image when he sketches it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elm's professional lens (chisel, slate, carving tools). The butterflies return at the climax to mirror the "relentless, calm movement," directly shaping his realization and final sketch.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elm seeks the form collective grief should take to resume carving. The tightening occurs when reading the poems shifts his understanding from monument to tapestry, narrowing his design options. Agency is present but mediated: Silas instructs "Read them" and "You must retrace," reducing Elm's self-driven escalation. The final choice—to "carve the weave, not the wound"—is earned by the poem-reading sequence but the cost (abandoning his monument design) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. No reversals; the arc is a steady deepening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—collective memory persisting through grief—emerges organically from the ribbon roll's physical weave and the intertwined poems. The final image (sketching the ribbon with poems etched inside) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Silas's dissolving edges and the butterfly migration's "relentless, calm movement." One slip: "love persisting through it, a collective memory held in tension" edges toward direct thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph, though it remains tied to the sketch rather than detached philosophizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and the epiphany is rooted in tactile particulars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled; distance modulates purposefully (closer during poem-reading, wider during the butterfly procession). Perceptual signature is consistent (Elm's professional eye for "shape," "form," "weave"). Some diction feels elevated beyond the focalizer's heat-of-moment lexicon: "fiercely meditative despair," "spectral mentorship," "purposeful ambiguity" read more authorial than character-particular under stress. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Silas's lines carry subtext (the ghostly form as projection of Elm's own insight). Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance image or understanding. Several template stems weaken momentum: "He was a thoughtful gravestone carver, but his hands were still. The last monument… had cracked… and now a profound stillness held him" (paraphrase loop on stillness). "Elm read them in order, then again at random, the voices of his lineage filling the quiet" recaps what was just shown. Opening line "worked stone in a thundering calm, his chisel echoing through the ancient greenhouse like distant, regular thunder" mixes metaphors (thundering calm / echoing thunder) and muddies clarity. Final image is strong and the prose is mostly clean, but these loops and mixed vehicles prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The spectral-mentor frame is familiar (ghost of a craftsman ancestor guiding the living heir), and the grief-as-tapestry metaphor, while specific, does not transform the trope into wholly new territory. The butterfly migration adds fresh particularity and the woven ribbon roll is a concrete, lived-in detail. Emotional truth is present and the piece avoids stock solutions, but the arc (creative block → ancestor's wisdom → renewed purpose) follows a well-worn template. The synthesis feels competent and earned rather than surprising; removing the greenhouse and butterflies would not fundamentally alter the emotional arc, signaling moderate rather than high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elm is present throughout and his choices (unrolling the ribbon, reading poems in order then at random, sketching the new design) create the key turn from paralysis to clarity. His profession shapes his perception ("shape," "form," "monument") and the final decision alters tactics (carve the weave, not a solitary angel). The carver role is essential to stakes and closure. However, the pivotal realization is delivered by Silas rather than earned through Elm's own missteps, which reduces agency slightly. Three beats: opening stillness, poem-reading sequence, final sketch. Early signal and closure linkage are strong; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ribbon roll is signaled early ("worn satchel… woven ribbon roll"), handled in the middle beat (unrolled, scrolls untied and read), and reweighted at closure (sketched as the new monument design). It supplies the physical structure for the poems and its woven form provides the tactile metaphor for collective grief. Removing it would break the story's central image and the final sketch. Three distinct beats with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity is high (silks, loops, threads) and the object is irreplaceable. Cost connection is present: Elm must abandon his prior monument concept in favor of the ribbon's design.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Spectral mentorship is present (Silas appears, instructs, dissolves) and frames the middle sequence, but the mechanics are more ornamental than constraining. Silas tells Elm what to do rather than creating obstacles or forcing hard choices. The concept shapes the story's tone and provides narrative permission for Elm's meditation, but the mentorship could be replaced with Elm's own memory or internal voice with minor edits. Two beats (appearance and instruction, final dissolution); early signal and closure participation are present but causal pressure is moderate. The concept is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears twice as a label ("fiercely meditative despair" in paragraph one, "meditation broken but his purpose fiercely clear" at the end) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes Elm's state rather than shaping a choice. No middle development; the attribute is not tested under pressure or traded off against another value. Present in setup and closure mentions but ornamental. Swappable with "intense focus" or "deep concentration" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Retrace" is signaled explicitly ("You must retrace," Silas instructs) and drives the central beat: Elm unrolls the ribbon, reads the poems in order then at random, and retraces his family's emotional contours. The action redefines his understanding (from monument to tapestry) and is irreplaceable; no synonym action would serve. Two beats (Silas's instruction, the reading sequence) with strong causal pressure. Closure linkage is tight: the final sketch directly embodies the retracing. Early signal and middle development are clear; cost is conceptual (abandoning his prior design).</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The family custom is signaled early ("family custom of trading favorite poems at dinner") and its mechanics matter: each scroll holds a chosen verse tied with thread, creating the physical archive Elm uses. The custom shapes the reading sequence (he recalls the ritual before reading) and the intertwined poems provide the content for his final sketch. Two beats (remembering the custom, reading the poems) with moderate causal pressure. Closure linkage is strong (poems etched into the sketch). However, the custom itself is backstory; the on-page action is reading, not the dinner ritual, which reduces direct involvement slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is present from the opening line and anchors every beat. Its cracked panes filter the amber/violet light, the mossy bench holds the ribbon roll, and the glass walls frame the butterfly migration. The setting supplies the solitude Elm seeks and the migration provides the live parallel that triggers his final realization ("relentless, calm movement"). Spatial details (bench, panes, vines) are handled on the page and the greenhouse's forgotten, transitional quality mirrors Elm's liminal creative state. Three beats with strong closure linkage; the setting charges the final image and constrains Elm's isolation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The butterfly migration timeframe is present (mentioned in paragraph one, peaks at the climax, flows onward at the end) and provides atmospheric pressure, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Elm's choices unfold at his own pace; the migration is simultaneous backdrop rather than a live clock. The migration's "relentless" quality mirrors Elm's realization but does not force urgency. Two beats (opening mention, climax parallel) with lyric resonance. Closure participation is moderate; the timeframe reweights meaning but does not constrain action. Swappable with another seasonal or natural cycle without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The motivation—to discover the shape of collective grief—is stated early ("His motivation, he told himself, was to discover…") and drives every choice: seeking solitude, reading the poems, sketching the new design. The desire is tested when the poems reveal not just sorrow but "joy, humor, resilience," forcing Elm to widen his understanding. Cost is present: he must abandon his prior monument concept. Three beats (opening statement, poem-reading friction, final sketch) with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. However, the motivation is partly "told" rather than fully dramatized in scene; we see the result (the sketch) more than the internal struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Thundering calm" is signaled in the opening line ("worked stone in a thundering calm") and returns in the butterfly description ("silent, thundering procession"). The tone holds through the spectral appearance (quiet, meditative) and modulates subtly at closure (calm becomes "fiercely clear" purpose). The oxymoron charges the final image by yoking stillness and power. Two beats (opening, climax) with purposeful reprise. However, the opening phrasing is mixed (chisel echoing "like distant, regular thunder" dilutes the calm), and the tone is more static descriptor than active modulation under pressure. Closure linkage is moderate; the tone supports but does not redefine the ending.</comment>
