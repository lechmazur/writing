<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" remains an abstract cipher with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of cosmic declaratives ("he understood his own role") rather than specific, character-particular thought. The spiral arbitration process is told as a method but never dramatized as internal conflict with competing impulses. No moment shows the witness making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the ending dissolves all stakes into abstract unity without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges only gradually across the first third without deliberate pattern-teaching, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The piece offers accumulative texture but no meaningful tightening or reversal; the witness moves through description until all "dissolves" and "unifies" without a causal turn or felt trade-off. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing in principle, but the cost is asserted ("the need for witness or library" passes) rather than made undeniable on the page. Under an Accumulative lens the final image should reweight prior material with pressure; here it abstracts away all particulars into "unified field" without visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The temple library supplies vivid spatial anchors—shelves stretching into shadows, black obsidian pedestal, colossal dormant telescope—and the softcover dictionary is handled twice (opened, placed). Sensory detail is present but filtered through cosmic rather than character-specific priorities; the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final image charges the library (walls dissolve into streams of light) but the transformation is asserted rather than grounded in spatial consequence. Micro-setting (the dictionary, the pedestal) appears but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the witness walks, reads, recalls, and the universe simply complies with dissolution. The ending unifies "all illusions" without agency, renunciation, or visible cost; coincidence (the universe's hiccup passing) resolves the premise. No moment shows a trade-off or sacrifice that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—unity beneath illusion—emerges from repeated imagery (spiral, dictionary, hush) but is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("all was unified, all illusions unraveled") rather than earned through specific action. The piece resists a tidy moral in tone yet offers no ambiguity or counter-reading; the witness achieves total clarity without cost. The softcover dictionary recurs but its transformation (pages now blank) is told, not shown as a loss or reweighting. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing in form but the final lines ("resounding hush became the only sound, the only truth") read as thematic summary rather than a resonant image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("nebulous shadows," "eldritch light," "colossal, dormant telescope") but borders on ornamental; under peak stress the register does not compress or shift to match urgency. Psychic distance remains far throughout; no micro-focus anchors embodied sensation or specific thought texture. Perceptual signature is generic cosmic rather than character-specific. The phrase "spiral arbitration" and "journeying inward while walking out" recur as labels without demonstrating how the witness's way of noticing differs from another observer's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled but syntactic variety is low: most sentences follow [Subject + verb + object/modifier] with participial or prepositional openers. Paraphrase loops appear: "ancient temple library lost in time" (paragraph 1) echoes "ancient temple library lost in time" (final third); "resounding hush" recurs five times without reweighting. Template cadence runs through the middle: "He read… He recalled… His thoughts… He turned…" across four consecutive paragraphs (−0.5). Figurative language is dense ("shelves stretching into nebulous shadows," "streams of light, data, and memory") but much is ornamental rather than purposeful; mixed metaphor: "time as a river, space as a fabric" are both called "mere metaphors" yet the library's walls "dissolve into streams" without causal link. Information density is low; many lines restate cosmic scale without advancing situation. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: template cadence + paraphrase loops = −1.0 total in Q7. Final-third loops disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—witness at the end of history in a cosmic library—is familiar from genre templates (Borges, conceptual SF) and the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "spiral arbitration" and "journeying inward while walking out" are intriguing labels but remain ornamental; removing them would not break story logic. The ending dissolves all particulars into abstract unity, a move frequent in metaphysical SF. No turn or intensification grows from prior character choice; the universe's hiccup simply ends. Derivative premise with insufficient transformation: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. Observation is continuous; the climax (all illusions unraveled) happens to him rather than through his decision. No agency, no cost tied to his action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary is handled in two distinct beats: opened and read (paragraph 10–12), then placed on the pedestal and spoken from (paragraphs 24–26). It returns with reweighted meaning (pages now blank, purpose fulfilled). Early signal present; middle and closure touches present. Swappable with another book of knowledge without altering logic; no unique property constrains choice. Lands in 5.5–6.3 range for purposeful reprise with cost suggested but not causally enforced.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is mentioned four times but never demonstrated as a method that shapes stakes or alters tactics. Described as "cyclical refinement of truth through repeated judgment" yet no judgment is shown on the page. Present as theme claim, absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears twice as a descriptor of the witness's method but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible trade-off where exactness costs time or wandering costs precision. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The action "unify" is declared as goal early and asserted as achieved in the final third ("all was unified"). It does not create a turn; the universe complies without resistance. Swappable with "perceive the truth" or "transcend illusion" with minor edits. Functional presence, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is mentioned three times and described as the witness's method. The story shows him walking corridors and recalling memories but does not dramatize how inward journey and outward motion interact or create friction. Present as motif, absent as mechanics that shape attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is detailed (shelves, balcony, atrium, telescope, obsidian pedestal) and present across all beats. It supplies resources (the dictionary, the pedestal) and the final image (walls dissolving). It does not pressure a choice or force a trade-off; the witness moves freely. Early signal strong; middle presence strong; closure participation via transformation (walls dissolve). Lands in mid-5s for coherent setting involvement without constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" is mentioned four times but remains metaphorical. No ticking clock tightens decisions; the hiccup is described as "brief, infinite" and eventually "passed" without altering tactics. Present as timeframe label, absent as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is stated early ("His motivation was pure") and drives the witness's activity (reading, walking, arbitrating). It is never conflicted or tested by cost; the witness succeeds without sacrifice. Desire is told and pursued but not dramatized with friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" appears five times and establishes tone coherently across turns. It modulates slightly (deepens in the atrium, becomes "the only sound" at closure) but remains static rather than charged by pressure. The final line ("resounding hush became the only sound, the only truth") attempts to reweight the motif but reads as summary. Present across beats and ending; one-note mood limits upper range.</comment>
