<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair is characterized primarily through reported summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His "expectantly resigned" manner is asserted but never tested through a difficult micro-choice; the story reports that he guides the choir "not by adding complexity, but by subtracting noise," yet we never witness him making a tough call under pressure. The ensemble members remain generic placeholders—"soprano from the hills," "bass from the city"—without distinct interiority or embodied emotion. Motivations are declared ("his motivation, to braid diverse voices") rather than dramatized through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed; who Alistair is, where precisely in the library, and when in the rehearsal cycle remain vague past 120 words, triggering −0.4. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (density increase across autumn weeks), but no single meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page—the "gradual transformation" and final performance are narrated rather than dramatized. The rosette is presented, the soprano and bass "now shared smiles," and the final performance happens off-stage in summary; no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost lands in scene. The closure unit is a summary assertion ("he saw that harmony, though elusive, was possible") rather than an image or action that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are evoked with texture ("amber light," "scent of old books") but function as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental detail meaningfully alters a choice or charges the final image; the rosette is described but never handled in a way that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—who stands where, how the rehearsal space is arranged—and the town square performance is merely mentioned without grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to achieve vocal harmony and unlearn communal hatred—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The story summarizes "across the weeks" without dramatizing a single rehearsal crisis, failed attempt, or meaningful tightening that narrows options. The soprano and bass "once wary, now shared smiles" is a summary leap, not an earned reversal. The final performance is recounted in a single sentence with no visible cost or consequence that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of unlearning hatred through "subtracting noise" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete events. The zither rosette is assigned symbolic weight by authorial assertion ("Let this remind us... that beauty often resides in what we preserve from silence") rather than accumulating meaning through action. The final image offers no resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—instead, Alistair's smile and the assertion that "harmony, though elusive, was possible" deliver a tidy moral. The piece tells its theme rather than earning it through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person narration remains stable, but the voice is generic and lacks perceptual signature; phrases like "traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned," and "vanishing arts" recur as labels without embodied texture. The single line of dialogue ("Let this remind us...") is formal and expository rather than goal-driven or carrying subtext. Alistair's grandfather's story is delivered in summary ("He spoke of the zither maker...") rather than dramatized, and the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—every paragraph moves at the same measured pace.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "distractions—fear, prejudice, pride—were stripped away" is immediately restated as "He called this 'subtracting noise,' a process of peeling back layers"; "the vanishing arts of communal song" is re-echoed as "that art is vanishing." Template cadence dominates the middle third ("He knew... He believed... He called..."), applying −0.6. Stock metaphors ("braiding diverse voices," "peeling back layers") appear without fresh inflection. The prose is clear but information-sparse, with many sentences restating the same concept across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The choir-as-metaphor-for-reconciliation premise is a well-worn template executed without transformation. The zither rosette, "expectantly resigned" attribute, and "subtracting noise" method feel checklist-inserted rather than organically synthesized; the rosette could be replaced with any symbolic object with minor edits. No turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight; the arc is predictable from the opening paragraph. The piece hedges toward a safe middle, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Alistair is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a key turn; he observes, guides (off-stage), and narrates a grandfather's story in summary. His role is functional but entirely swappable with any patient mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rosette appears in two beats: placed on the music stand with explanatory dialogue, then mentioned in the final gathering where Alistair presents it to the group. It is described and assigned symbolic meaning but never handled in a way that constrains choice or alters tactics. The return is a cameo, not a causal or reweighted reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is mentioned four times as a thematic label but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is told ("the vanishing arts of communal song faded from memory") rather than dramatized through a choice or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is asserted twice as a static descriptor; it does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The trait remains label-only, with no visible tradeoff or cost tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Denote" appears five times but functions as a synonym for "symbolize" or "represent" rather than driving a turn. The rosette "denotes the craftsmanship," patterns "denote the cyclical nature," and a gesture "denoted a larger shift"—all passive observations, not actions that redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is signaled early and mentioned across three beats, but its mechanics are told rather than shown. We are told Alistair "had them sing single notes, then chords, listening until the dissonance dissolved," but no rehearsal attempt is dramatized on the page where the method shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is present throughout and provides ambient texture, but it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The setting functions as a postcard backdrop; no micro-element of the library (velvet drapes, music stand placement) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is invoked in the final paragraph and implied by "across the weeks of rehearsal," but the timeframe is vague and untracked. No live clock tightens decisions; the passage of autumn weeks is summarized without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation to braid diverse voices into harmony is stated early and frames the entire arc, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between wants and costs. Alistair's desire is told; we see no moment where he must trade off between unity and individual voice, or face a cost for pursuing harmony.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears three times as a descriptive phrase but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The tone remains static and contemplative throughout; no cadence shift marks escalation or closure.</comment>
