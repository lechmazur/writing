<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her bone-setting skill establishes professional grounding, but interiority remains abstract ("yearning...swell into quiet determination") rather than embodied contradiction. The "shrewdly innocent" attribute is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the cost of naive faith wielded for shrewd peace. The family's grief is summarized ("silent sorrow," "fragile hope") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, tracing bones, deciding to use the tooth) but lack visible internal resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—discovered object → ritual → constellation image. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (the new constellation reweights grief into memorial) with felt cost (tears of release, acceptance of mystery). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Elara, dawn, secret garden, body). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth is found and used. However, the causal chain is thin: the tooth's properties and the ritual's mechanics are asserted, not dramatized, and the family's agreement lacks friction. The Cost Proof Test barely passes—"tears of release" and the dissolving tooth provide some emotional and visual cost—but the protagonist's alteration is stated more than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is signaled early and returns at closure, and the willow's canopy frames the ritual. Sensory detail is selective (moss bed, soft shadows, twilight sky) and filtered through Elara's professional attention (tracing bones, assessing structure). However, the garden does not constrain a choice—Elara could perform the ritual anywhere—and spatial choreography is generic (kneeling, placing, watching). The micro-setting (body among roots, tooth in throat hollow) grounds discovery but does not charge the final image with a choice or physical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: healing grief through mystery rather than solving it. One tightening occurs when Elara finds the tooth and decides to use it. Agency is renunciation (forgiving the fey, accepting mystery) but the family's agreement is frictionless and the ritual itself is narrated without obstacles or second thoughts. The tooth's glow and dissolution provide a visual turn, but no on-page reversal tests commitment—apparent solutions do not generate new complications. Cost is legible (acceptance of the unknowable, tears) but mild; no live option is foreclosed with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the changeling motif and Elara's stance toward mystery, but the final constellation image borders on overt symbolism ("turn mistakes into constellations" is stated three times, including in the final paragraph). The piece claims complexity ("mysteries, not solving them") yet resolves grief tidily without counter-reading or ambiguity. The ritual dissolves all tension into light and permanence, offering a stated moral rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic echo penalty: "turn mistakes into constellations" recurs as explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and carries a faint archaic register ("fey," "changelings," "motes of light") that fits the folkloric setting. However, interiority leans abstract ("yearning...swell," "cleft in certainty") and narrates state rather than embodying perception. The family has no dialogue; Elara's single line of exposition ("showed them the tooth and spoke of...") is summarized. Filter verbs are sparse. Perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic noticing pattern distinguishes Elara's professional gaze from a neutral narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and flows without major opacity. However, paraphrase loops abound: "forgiving skeptic...seen too much suffering to believe easily in miracles, yet too much kindness to dismiss them" restates the same stance twice in two sentences; "shrewdly innocent...child's curiosity...practiced precision" cycles synonyms without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openings across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphor: "weaving starlight from grief." Register drift: "nostalgic innovation" and "conceptual repricing" feel academic rather than Elara's lexicon. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("turn mistakes into constellations" repeated) triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disallow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The changeling-tooth-as-healing-relic premise is a familiar folkloric template executed without transformation. The constellation ending is poetic but predictable—grief literalized as stars is a common metaphor. Elara's arc (skeptic softened by magic) follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious turn. The ritual itself is generic (speak, glow, dissolve, ascend) and could be swapped into any healing-magic story. No bold risk or lived detail distinguishes this telling from adjacent genre examples.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (forgiving skeptic) is present throughout and makes the key decision to use the tooth for healing rather than blame. However, "forgiving skeptic" functions mainly as a label; her skepticism is declared but never tested on the page—she accepts the tooth's magic immediately without visible doubt or cost. The trait shapes one choice (ritual over investigation) but could be swapped for "compassionate healer" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, but label-only treatment −0.3, swappability −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in the discovery beat (found in throat hollow), drives the middle decision (to use it in ritual), and dissolves in the closure image. Three distinct beats +1.4, early signal +0.5, causal pressure (enables the ritual) +0.8, closure linkage (dissolves into constellation) +1.2. However, its mechanics are asserted (it "could reveal truths") not demonstrated, and it resolves a problem (grief) it did not help create −0.7. Total: ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named twice and shapes Elara's thematic stance (accepting mystery) but does not constrain an on-page choice—she acts on the tooth without visible doubt splitting her options. It functions as theme more than stake. Present by first third +0.5, one beat (internal realization) +0.4, thematic resonance at closure +0.5, but ornamental (no action pressure) −0.8, label-only −0.3. Total: ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is declared in exposition ("moved with a shrewdly innocent air") and restated once ("shrewdly innocent part of her soul align") but never dramatized as a tradeoff. No on-page action shows naive faith enabling shrewd peace with visible cost. Label-only −0.8, ornamental −0.7, no middle development −cap at 3.4. Total: ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Yearn" is signaled early ("yearned for a world where broken things could be made whole") and returns in the middle and final paragraphs, framing Elara's motivation. However, yearning is told repeatedly rather than shown in conflicted micro-choices, and it could be swapped for "hope" or "wish" without structural change. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5. Total: ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Bone setting is Elara's profession, named in the opening, performed on the substitute body (aligning limbs to restore dignity), and metaphorically extended to the ritual ("bone setting of the heart"). Two beats +0.9, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (her skill authorizes the ritual) +0.7, closure linkage (shapes the ceremony) +0.9, but the mechanics never constrain a choice or create cost—literal and metaphorical uses are ornamental. Swappability (could be "healing" or "midwifery") −0.6. Total: ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is anchored in the opening, hosts the discovery and the ritual, and reappears in the final image. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, closure linkage (ritual under the willow) +1.1. However, it does not constrain a choice—Elara could perform the ritual elsewhere—and spatial details (hedge maze, willow, moss) remain postcard description. No micro-setting pressure −0.7, ornamental use −0.4. Total: ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Time is anchored (dawn discovery, "days that followed" epilogue) but does not tighten decisions. The ritual proceeds without clock pressure or deadline. The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" is continuous but passive—events unfold in sequence without urgency. Present +0.3, functional across beats +0.6, but no tactical pressure from time −0.5, vague tracking (no clock) −0.3. Total: ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is stated three times, including the final paragraph, and motivates Elara's ritual choice. However, it is told repeatedly rather than dramatized in friction between desire and cost. The family agrees without conflict; the tooth's use encounters no resistance. Early signal +0.6, one beat (decision to heal rather than blame) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only −0.7, label-only repetition −0.3. Total: ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is present in the blend of folklore (changeling, fey) and Elara's forward-looking ritual. Tone is elegiac and hopeful throughout, modulating slightly from grief to release. However, the phrase "nostalgic innovation" itself appears only once as an abstract label, and the tone remains static—no sharp shift under pressure charges the final image. Coherent across beats +0.8, closure linkage (constellation as new memorial) +0.8, but single static mood −0.4, label-only mention −0.3. Total: ~5.1.</comment>
