<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ero's motivation is abstract and largely interior, but the piece does provide embodied micro-choices: he sits, opens his senses, syncs the pulse, begins to skim resonance. The final renunciation—placing the arrowhead back into the dust—carries visible cost (centuries of purpose completed, his own lesson learned). Internal contradiction is minimal; the characterization leans heavily on concept and atmosphere rather than flawed human impulse. The weathered resolve is asserted more than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early: dust layering, harmonic skimming, resonance patterns. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the arrowhead's wandering pulse harmonizes; Ero learns stillness contains every journey). The cost is legible: the arrowhead's ancient purpose completes, and Ero's singular motivation resolves into quiet peace. Orientation anchors appear promptly (Ero, Towers of Bone, canyon). One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrowhead's pulse shifts from vacancy to harmony, reweighting the premise. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Towers of Bone supply a vivid, consistent micro-setting: ancient leviathan ribs, grey dust, the slit of sky. The arrowhead's "invisible shelf" and the bone tower's foundational hum constrain Ero's final action—he must skim resonance over resonance rather than move the object. Sensory selection (dusk-swifts, the canyon's echoes ordering themselves) is purposeful and filtered through Ero's harmonic focus. The environment charges the final image: dust "welcomes" the arrowhead, and the canyon's voice absorbs the restored chord.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Ero's discovery that the pulse seeks harmony (not a target) shifts his approach: he cannot move the arrowhead, so he must help it resonate in place. This tightening forecloses the option of relocation and forces a new tactic. The cost is conceptual and felt: the song completes only by Ero's patient, non-mobile action. However, the escalation is more a deepening of understanding than a series of narrowing pressures; the piece never tests Ero's commitment with a credible obstacle or competing want.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: the arrowhead as tuning device, navigation through stillness, harmony restored across eons. The final image—"stillness, when listened to, contains every journey"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The piece avoids label-speak and lets the restored chord resonate as answer. A slight over-articulation appears in "He had learned the final lesson," which edges toward theme summary. Subtext operates cleanly in the swifts' vortex mirroring convergence, and the wandering pulse's question repeated across millennia.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature rooted in Ero's harmonic focus: he hears discordant hums, feels historical reverence, reads birds as language. Diction is elevated and consistent ("profound, weathered resolve," "spiritual navigation"), though "historical reverence" and "aimless frequency" occasionally drift toward academic register. Psychic distance stays controlled; filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in phrases like "his own pulse in tune with the centuries" supports the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but the prose carries noticeable scaffold: "His work was to listen, to trace...," "His motivation was singular: to learn...," "A profound, weathered resolve solidified within Ero." Template cadence appears in "He sat, becoming..." and "He began to skim..." Stock metaphors like "slice time" and "living inkblot" appear without fresh angle. Paraphrase loops surface: "The pulse was not searching for a target, but for a harmony" restates the prior beat's vacancy/seeking note. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors that obscure clarity. Information density is strong in the closure sequence where resonance, flock, and chord converge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of harmonic skimming, bone resonance, and spiritual navigation via stillness offers a non-obvious angle. The arrowhead as tuning device rather than weapon is a fresh inflection. However, the premise leans on familiar mystic-craftsperson and ancient-relic templates; transformation occurs through specificity (leviathan ribs, dusk-swifts, the wandering pulse) rather than bold structural risk. Emotional truth is present but abstracted by the conceptual frame. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, elevating it within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ero's choices create key turns: sitting to listen, syncing the pulse with the flock, skimming resonance over the bone tower, placing the arrowhead back. Present in setup (introduced immediately), development (mid-beat decision to help it navigate in place), and payoff (final action completes the song). Two distinct beats of choice. Causal pressure: his method (harmonic skimming) is essential to the resolution. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high; no near-synonym could replace the harmonic skimmer role. Cost: his centuries-long purpose completes, and his own lesson is learned on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears in setup (discovered at the bone tower base), development (held to forehead, pulse synced), and payoff (placed back into dust, work complete). Handled across three beats. Causal pressure: its wandering pulse drives Ero's entire action; without it, the story has no conflict. Closure linkage: the final image shows it "now just a quiet stone, its work finally complete." Specificity: obsidian, sharp enough to slice time, severed from its source. Cost: the arrowhead's unfinished note finally harmonizes, foreclosing its wandering state. Swappability low; the tuning-device nature is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The pulse shapes stakes: Ero must decipher its aimless frequency and help it find harmony. Present in setup (felt as vacancy), development (synced with the flock), and payoff (settles into the canyon's voice). Causal pressure moderate: it defines the problem and guides the solution. Closure linkage: "The wandering pulse settled, finding its rest." Specificity: the pulse as unfinished note is vivid. Cost: the pulse's millennial question resolves. However, the pulse is somewhat abstract and could be summarized as "lost resonance" without major edits. Two gates plus thematic payoff justify mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Historical reverence is label-only in one beat: "Ero felt a shiver of historical reverence; this was a made thing, a purposeful fragment from a people swallowed by the dust." Does not constrain or enable an action with cost; it colors his stance but does not alter his choice. Present in setup only. No middle development or payoff. No causal pressure. Swappable with "archaeological respect" or "cultural awe." Ornamental use. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; further reduced for label-only and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Appraise drives the middle turn: "His duty was to appraise, not merely the object, but the echo of its making, its journey, its silence." This reframes the conflict from passive observation to active harmonic work. Present in setup (stated as duty), development (appraisal method using the flock), and payoff (appraisal completes by restoring harmony). Two beats. Causal pressure: the act of appraisal is what leads Ero to discover the pulse's true nature. Closure linkage: the final placement is the completion of appraisal. However, "appraise" could be swapped with "decode" or "interpret" with minor edits; the action is not as specific as the arrowhead or pulse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early: "read the answer through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight." Mechanics matter: the swifts' simultaneous turn reveals that the pulse seeks harmony; their spiraling vortex mirrors convergence. Present in setup (Ero lifts eyes to sky), development (syncs pulse with flock rhythm), and payoff (flock swirls into perfect vortex as harmony restores). Two beats. Causal pressure: without the flock's pattern, Ero cannot decode the pulse. Specificity: the collective movement as "language of instinct" is vivid. However, the flock could be replaced with another pattern-source (e.g., wind currents, water ripples) with moderate edits. Cost: the method enables but does not itself carry sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Towers of Bone supply resources and pressure: the bone tower's foundational hum is what Ero draws out to match the arrowhead's pulse. Present in setup (traversed, described), development (Ero's fingers whisper against the bone tower), and payoff (the canyon's echoes order themselves, amplifying the new-old chord). Three beats. Causal pressure: without the bone tower's resonance, the harmony cannot be restored. Closure linkage: the final image shows "The Towers of Bone stood silent, their echoes now gently holding a finished song." Specificity high: ancient leviathan ribs, petrified forest. Irreplaceable; the bones are the instrument. Cost: the setting's latent voice is activated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" appears as atmospheric detail in setup and is mentioned again at closure ("the canyon echoed...with a restored, faint chord" across eons). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; Ero's process is patient and untimed. Present in setup and payoff only; no middle beat where time pressure alters moves. No causal pressure. Swappable with "millennia of silence" or "ages of accumulation." Ornamental use. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; slight lift for lyric reprise that reweights the closure image with historical weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to learn to navigate without moving"—is stated early and pursued throughout. It shapes Ero's final realization: "He had not moved an inch, yet he had navigated a lost thing home across eons." Present in setup (declared as singular motivation), development (implicit in his choice to help the arrowhead navigate in place), and payoff (lesson learned on the page). Two beats. Causal pressure moderate: the motivation frames his approach but does not face a conflicting want or obstacle that tests commitment. Closure linkage: the final insight directly answers the stated desire. Cost: Ero's own pulse tunes to the centuries, foreclosing restlessness. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through friction; no scene where stillness conflicts with an urge to act.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is coherent from the opening ("weathered resolve, a calm persistence worn smooth by time") through the closure ("His weathered resolve was a quiet peace"). Tone modulates subtly: early, it is active patience; at the end, it is satisfied stillness. Present in setup, development (solidifies when Ero commits to help the arrowhead), and payoff (final beat). Charges the final image: the tone of earned rest completes the arc. Specificity: "worn smooth by time" and "quiet peace" are distinct from generic determination. However, the tone is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or varied rhythm under pressure. No major friction; the resolve never wavers or complicates a choice.</comment>
