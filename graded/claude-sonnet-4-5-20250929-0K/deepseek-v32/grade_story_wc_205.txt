<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reimagine the civilization is clear and consistent, but her interior life defaults to abstract poeticism rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final moment—smiling and beginning to write—reads as satisfaction without visible cost; her "burnished sorrow" becomes a comfortable shield rather than a painful trade-off. Micro-choices are present (draping the mirror, handling the shard) but they don't foreclose options or reveal competing impulses in real time. The character reads more as a vehicle for thematic meditation than a mind wrestling with genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (baroque asteroid, post-Rend, archaeological dispute) by the opening third and holds a hybrid lens tilting toward Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finds her interpretive truth and begins to write—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized: no career consequence, no relationship friction, no visible forfeiture on the page. The storm ritual and shard handling provide a tightening sequence, yet the final image ("began to write") gestures toward future action rather than landing a decisive on-page change. The causal chain is coherent but the closure effect remains conceptual without felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time as golden/amber haze, and the ornate mirror anchor the setting vividly and filter through Elara's poetic lens. The temporal storm applies pressure by filling the room with churning time, and the mirror ritual uses the environment purposefully. However, spatial choreography within the study is vague—no clear layout or object distances—and the shard's handling lacks tactile specificity (its "cold surface biting into her palm" is the lone concrete touch). The setting charges atmosphere but does not constrain a pivotal choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: proving the civilization was aesthetically sensitive, not brutally theocratic. Elara's hypothesis about the mirror ritual and vase shard provides a meaningful deepening, and the storm sequence tightens focus. Yet the escalation is primarily internal reflection; no on-page opponent challenges her, no resource is lost, no trade-off materializes. The "dispute would rage on" acknowledgment deflates the stakes rather than charging them with consequence. Agency is present in her interpretive leap, but the cost—publishing against opposition—is announced, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transience, beauty, intimacy with time, burnished sorrow—emerges organically from the visible-time conceit, the mirror ritual, and the vase shard. The final image of fracture lines "glowing like veins of gold" reweights the shard from debris to map, a resonant non-literal answer. However, Elara's interior monologue edges into thematic statement ("a civilization she had reimagined from silence into song") rather than letting image alone carry meaning. The piece resists overt moralizing but occasionally asserts its thesis instead of trusting the particulars to speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct poetic register ("burnished sorrow," "motive...a determined, graceful purpose"). Elara's perceptual signature—seeing metaphors in dust, allegories in arches—is character-specific and consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("profound aesthetic sensitivity," "elegy woven with archaeological evidence") that feels authorial rather than voice-native under pressure. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraph's compression ("a small, sad curve of lips, and began to write") is efficient but flattens the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Information density is high in the opening, anchoring world and conflict efficiently. However, paraphrase loops recur: "burnished sorrow" appears three times with near-identical framing, and "reimagine" / "reimagined" cycles without added pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third. Figurative language is dense ("time like golden mist," "rushing amber waves") without pattern-teaching or cost; some images border on purple ("allegories in the cracked arches"). The final lines regain clarity but arrive after accumulated line-level drag. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and density without payoff (−0.5) penalties totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The conceit of visible time post-Great Rend is fresh and purposeful, charging both the mirror ritual and Elara's poetic lens. The mirror-covering practice as aesthetic self-protection rather than superstition offers a non-obvious inflection on the archaeological dispute. However, the broader frame—lone scholar fighting establishment over artifact interpretation—is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (grief polished into purpose, finding solace in reinterpretation) follows predictable beats. The synthesis feels competent and specific to this world but not transformative enough to reach higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her revolutionary past frames her motive, but "defunct" status remains backstory without on-page friction. Her choices—covering the mirror, holding the shard, devising the argument—are interpretive rather than turning-point decisions that alter tactics or stakes. The closure (beginning to write) is hers but passive; no cost materializes from her choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in the opening exposition, is handled physically during the storm sequence ("took the crystal vase shard in her hand, its cold surface biting into her palm"), and returns charged in the final image ("fracture lines glowing like veins of gold"). It shapes the central argument and is causally present in the closure beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; it drives two beats and the ending image, earning high-band eligibility. However, its physical properties (sharp edges, etched script) are noted but not exploited in a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute frames the story and sets up the stakes (proving aesthetic sensitivity vs. brutal theocracy). Elara's research and argument are on-page choices, and the dispute shapes her motive. However, Dr. Kellor and the "opposing faction" remain off-stage; no confrontation or tactical adjustment occurs. The dispute is the premise but does not constrain a peak choice or alter the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" colors Elara's perceptual filter throughout ("metaphors in the drifting dust," "allegories in the cracked arches") and justifies her interpretive method. It enables her argument but does not impose a visible cost or foreclose an option. The trait is label-plus-demonstration rather than a binding constraint; swapping to "analytical" or "intuitive" would shift diction but not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the midpoint turn: Elara devises her interpretation of the vase and mirror ritual, which becomes her treatise. The action is signaled early ("needed to devise a new interpretation") and executed in the storm sequence. It drives the narrative but is primarily internal; the mechanics of devising (observing, hypothesizing, connecting clues) are present but do not face external resistance or reshape tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is seeded in the first third as a fragmentary log practice, hypothesized mid-story, and enacted on-page during the temporal storm. The ritual shapes Elara's epiphany: without her reflection, she focuses on the shard and imagines the makers' hands. The method is causally active, appears in two distinct beats (hypothesis, enactment), and charges the closure argument. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the method constrains her attention and enables her interpretive breakthrough.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with carved filigree and the study with its arched window and ornate mirror frame the action vividly. The temporal storm applies atmospheric pressure and fills the room during the key beat. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; Elara's breakthrough could occur in any ornate study. The asteroid is present across beats but functions as backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Visible time as a shimmering haze is introduced early, accentuates Elara's aging hands, and manifests dramatically in the temporal storm. The storm creates disorientation (the reason for the mirror ritual) and Elara's reflection shows visible aging afterward. The timeframe shapes atmosphere and the mirror practice but does not impose a ticking-clock urgency or alter Elara's tactical decisions. It is thematically integrated and present in the closure image but does not tighten choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to reimagine the civilization is stated explicitly, dramatized through research and the storm-ritual sequence, and drives the closure (she will publish her treatise). Elara's motive colors every choice and the final image reaffirms it. However, friction between want and cost is muted: no career risk, no relationship sacrifice, no resource forfeited on the page. The motivation is coherent and present but operates without visible trade-off, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is seeded early ("burnished sorrow that polished her grief"), recurs in the middle ("sorrow burnished into art"), and anchors the final paragraph ("The burnished sorrow of it all was a comfort now"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly: from weight to purpose to comfort. It charges the ending image and reweights prior material. However, the repetition edges into redundancy without deepening the emotional texture; the phrase becomes a motif rather than a felt state evolving under pressure.</comment>
