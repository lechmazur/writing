<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Master Juro's interiority is concrete and embodied—the "quietly explosive" donor heart beat, the tea-trail tracking method—but the final decision to descend at dawn feels more like inevitable narrative machinery than a choice foreclosing a path with visible cost. The donor-heart premise invites embodied tension (biological memory, alien rhythm), yet most beats deliver contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The wing-viewing sequence demonstrates watchful patience, but the protagonist never hesitates, doubts, or wrestles with competing goods; he simply follows clues. Motivation remains declarative ("to learn why some people magnetize stories") without on-page friction or a micro-choice that alters present stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece is cleanly oriented (tea house, three moons post-transplant, morpho wing) and follows a Situational lens: coincidence (the wing, the sunlight angle) complicates rather than resolves, and the ending crystallizes Juro's readiness without a causal reversal. The closure unit is Charged Poise—he pockets the wing and commits to descend—but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits the definition yet lowers impact. The sun-trail pattern reveal at mid-story provides one meaningful tightening that narrows interpretive options. Escalation is clean under the Situational lens, though the final beat remains a decision to begin rather than a visible forfeiture or transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house, valley mist, and Whispering Stones supply coherent atmosphere and spatial logic. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting: Juro tilts it to track reflected light, which reveals the sun-trail map and points to the Stones—the object constrains his next choice. Sensory detail is purposeful (steam curl, lattice light, iridescence) and filtered through a dye master's priorities. The sun's migration across the floor anchors time and mood without clutter. The ending image—mist glowing blue and gold—charges the final beat and ties setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learn the donor's story) is signaled early and deepens when the wing's reflected pattern matches the tea trails, narrowing Juro's interpretive options. Under the Situational lens, coincidence (wing + sunlight) complicates but does not resolve; the protagonist's attention and watchfulness drive the tightening. However, the cost remains prospective—he will descend at dawn—rather than a present forfeiture or visible tradeoff. One meaningful pressure point (pattern recognition) is sufficient at this length, but the lack of an on-page price or tactical constraint keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (quiet attention surfaces hidden patterns; people magnetize stories by holding space for them) emerges from concrete particulars—tea trails, iridescence, the donor heart's signal—without overt statement until the penultimate paragraph's brief meta-claim. The morpho wing recurs with reweighted meaning (ornament → map → signature), and the final image (mist in blue and gold) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece invites reflection and ambiguity. One slip: "people magnetize stories not by seeking drama, but by holding a space quiet and deep enough" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains character-focalized and tied to Juro's insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, close, and embodied through a dye master's vocabulary (light surrender, iridescence as conversation, tracking sun trails). Psychic distance remains consistent, and diction ("valley-mist wonder," "iridescent caution") feels voice-motivated rather than generic. No dialogue; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—watchful, patient, attuned to light and pattern—is distinct and rhythmically controlled under reflective pressure. One minor register note: "reciprocal grace" and "narrative one" tilt slightly elevated for a man tracking tea drops, but the voice remains coherent and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentences are varied, information-dense, and propulsive; the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. The sun-trail tracking sequence shows high clarity and purpose. However, several lines loop or over-explain: "Iridescent caution, he mused, was the universe's most delicate directive" immediately follows the wing description without adding pressure; "A story was magnetizing here, now" summarizes what the prior paragraph dramatized; "The quiet in the floating tea house deepened, filled with the satisfaction of a mystery accepted" stacks abstractions. Filter-verb reliance ("he felt," "he understood," "he suspected") appears in four beats but does not dull immediacy severely. No sustained template cadence or mixed metaphors touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The donor-heart premise and the morpho wing as message offer fresh synthesis; the biological-memory angle and the light-tracking method feel specific rather than stock. The piece commits to its premise and follows the implications without retreat. However, the emotional arc (patient observation → quiet resolve) and the ending stance (he will honor the donor by visiting the Stones) follow a familiar shape: reverent elder receives symbolic gift and accepts a quest. The transformation test is borderline—swap "dye master" for "calligrapher" and "morpho wing" for "pressed flower" and the emotional journey remains largely intact. One unconventional choice elevates: treating the donor heart's beat as narrative signal rather than medical metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Watchful dye master: present throughout; shapes two beats (tea-trail observation, wing-tilting that reveals the map); final choice (descend at dawn) is character-driven. The dye-master trait (observing light) enables the sun-trail method and the wing insight. However, the observation is largely passive until the final paragraph, and the decision feels foreordained rather than a turn that alters tactics. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is observational rather than choice-constrained. Specific cost is prospective (he will go) rather than on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing: arrives with note ("Look"), is examined in multiple beats (iridescence description, tilted to catch light, reflected pattern reveals map), returns in closure (pocketed over heart). The wing's unique property (microscopic scales refract specific pattern) drives the key turn and points Juro to the Whispering Stones. Three gates met (setup, middle revelation, closure reprise). Irreplaceable: only this wing's structure could encode the sun-trail map. Visible cost: accepting the wing obligates Juro to honor the donor's story. One friction: the wing's arrival mechanism (pinned note) is unexplained, but its function is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Iridescent caution: named early ("iridescence was not a mere color but a conversation with light, a silent warning"); restated ("Iridescent caution, he mused, was the universe's most delicate directive"); echoed at closure ("some truths are only visible transiently"). The concept operates as theme rather than constraining choices or altering tactics. It does not narrow options or impose a tradeoff; Juro never hesitates due to caution. Setup and lyric reprise gates met, but middle development is label-only. The final invocation reweights meaning slightly but does not demonstrate cost or change present action. Ornamental presence; swappable with "fragile beauty" or "transient truth" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Quietly explosive: attributed to the donor heart ("a quietly explosive sensation beneath his calm exterior, like a pebble dropped into a deep well"); recurs when the heart "gave a small, hard thump" signaling the wing revelation. The trait enables one on-page action (Juro lifts the wing in response to the signal), which leads to the pattern discovery. Setup and middle gates met; closure participation is indirect (the heart "beat on, a steady drum"). The trait constrains tactics (he listens to the heart's signal rather than ignoring it), but the tradeoff is conceptual rather than visible. Specificity is high (biological memory as narrative impulse), but cost is muted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Illuminate: present in backstory (dye master observes "how light surrendered to cloth"), drives the wing-tilting beat (sunlight illuminates microscopic scales, revealing the map), and is named at closure ("To illuminate a life was to honor it"). The action shapes two turns (observation method, pattern discovery) and charges the final image. Setup, middle, and payoff gates met. However, "illuminate" is partly metaphorical (honor the donor's story) and could be replaced with "reveal" or "trace" without major loss. The dye-master profession tightens fit, but the climactic action is recognition rather than physical illumination. Causal pressure is solid; irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>By tracking sun trails: signaled early ("He had spent the quiet hours tracking sun trails across the wooden floor, marking their slow migration with drops of tea"); mechanics demonstrated (the wing's reflected light "painted a fleeting pattern on the far wall... a map of the sun trails he had meticulously tracked since dawn"). The method enables the key discovery and is profession-specific (dye master reads time by light's path). Setup and middle gates met; closure participation is indirect (he understands that the method revealed the message). One friction: the method is introduced as complete rather than attempted and refined under pressure. Visible cost is minimal (time spent), but specificity and causal linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house named Cloud's Rest: anchors who/where early; supplies lattice, wooden floor, and northern screen for spatial choreography. The setting enables the sun-trail tracking (floor surface, lattice light) and the wing-viewing (western lattice at specific angle). Micro-setting function: the floor and lattice constrain method and timing. Setup and middle gates met; closure participation is atmospheric (mist outside glows). The "floating rock" detail is ornamental (does not alter choices); the tea house could be any windowed structure with a floor. Specificity is high, but tactical pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After receiving the donor heart: timeframe anchored ("just three moons prior"); motivates Juro's presence at the tea house and his attention to the heart's signals. The post-transplant window does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Juro has no urgency (he will descend "at dawn" without pressure). Setup gate met; middle and closure development is thematic (biological memory) rather than time-constrained. The timeframe supports backstory and the donor-heart premise but does not alter tactics or narrow options. Functional but largely replaceable with "recently" or "this season."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To learn why some people magnetize stories: stated early as Juro's drawing question; restated at climax ("people magnetize stories not by seeking drama, but by holding a space quiet and deep enough"). The motivation frames his tea-house visit and his patient observation method. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or friction. Juro never hesitates, doubts the pursuit, or weighs it against a competing good. Setup and thematic payoff gates met; middle development is observational rather than choice-contested. The desire shapes framing but does not constrain a beat or impose visible cost. Functional presence without dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder: present throughout ("valley's eternal mist," "valley-mist wonder, that soft, pervasive awe, filled the room," "mist-shrouded valley," "The mist outside began to glow"). Tone is coherent, contemplative, and modulates slightly under the pattern revelation (awe intensifies). The final image ("mist... glowing... in hues of blue and gold") charges closure and ties tone to theme. Setup, middle, and payoff gates met. The tone supports rather than tensions the concept, which fits the piece's design but limits dynamic range. Pervasive and purposeful; one of the stronger integrations, though static mood rather than evolving pressure keeps it mid-high band.</comment>
