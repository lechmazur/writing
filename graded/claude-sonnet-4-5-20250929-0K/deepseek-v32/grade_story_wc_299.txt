<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to discover purpose is clear and drives the ledger-writing pivot, but the shift from "confidently uncertain" appraiser to memorabilia curator feels rushed—no on-page friction tests whether he can actually execute this plan or what he's trading away beyond the quarry job. The interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("echo valley longing," "confidently uncertain") rather than embodied contradiction; the speaker-cloth handling and ledger moment show micro-choices, but the final transformation reads more like declared epiphany than earned struggle. The backstory dominates ~40% of the text yet anchors adequately to present stimuli (the cloth, the window view), so BRR allowance applies without cap, but the lack of a live obstacle at closure keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal decision to write/repurpose his past + Accumulative texture around the cloth and roadie memories). Orientation anchors (quarry trailer, post-failure) land early. The closure is a Decisive Change: Leo leaves the trailer with a plan to open a shop, and the final paragraphs show the shop operational, confirming the shift. However, the cost is mostly told rather than shown—"His failure at the fair became a lesson, not a definition" summarizes rather than dramatizes the trade-off, and the shop's success montage lacks friction or visible sacrifice on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (writing in the ledger → decision to leave), but the escalation is smooth rather than pressured, and the conceptual cost of leaving roadie nostalgia behind is asserted more than felt in the closure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quarry trailer is vividly grounded (dim office, dusty items, grimy window, stark rock faces) and the Victorian inkwell and speaker-cloth scrap serve as micro-setting anchors that charge Leo's internal state. The spatial choreography (desk → window → desk → ledger) is clean and the sensory detail (rough fabric, overcast sky) filters through Leo's roadie/appraiser lens. The trailer setting pressures the choice to leave by mirroring his "hollowed-out spirit," satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrain or charge the final image. Minor gap: the city shop in the final third is summarized without spatial texture, so the ending loses some grounding, but the trailer itself does enough causal and symbolic work to elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering purpose after loss—is signaled early and drives the ledger-writing turn, but the escalation is gentle: Leo writes until "the facts gave way to feelings," then decides to blend roadie and appraiser skills. No external resistance or internal counter-pressure complicates this choice; the public failure at the fair is backstory, not an on-page obstacle, and the quarry assignment feels like exile rather than active opposition. The shop montage in the final third tells us he succeeded ("His failure at the fair became a lesson") without showing a trade-off or price paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (writing → decision), meeting the 600–800 word minimum, but the lack of visible cost or live friction caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—finding meaning in remnants, the work of "moving on"—emerges organically from Leo's dual identity and the speaker-cloth as anchor. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, where "he felt the applause not as memory, but as momentum" and "in the weave of a speaker grille cloth scrap" edge toward stated thesis. The cloth's progression (relic → key → exhibit → touchstone) offers a resonant non-literal answer, and the "echo valley longing" motif modulates from passive yearning to "directed" action. However, the shop-success montage flattens ambiguity—Leo's new stage works cleanly, no remaining cost or doubt—so the ending feels more resolved than resonant, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV throughout, no head-hopping. The narrative voice is stable and carries a distinct melancholic texture ("the silence after his public failure ringing in his ears," "echo valley longing"), but Leo's diction occasionally slips into therapeutic abstraction ("confidently uncertain," "insulate himself emotionally") that feels more like prompt-label than character idiom. Psychic distance is consistent; no dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose modulates appropriately from reflective at the desk to kinetic when he drives away, and the perceptual filter (roadie + appraiser) colors detail selection (hallmarks, speaker grille, tour setlists). Free indirect style is clean, but the lack of rough edges or vocal idiosyncrasy under pressure keeps this in mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no grammar or tense breaks. However, the prose carries noticeable text-pattern artifacts: repeated sentence stems ("He was...," "He would...," "He wrote...," "The scrap was...") across multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence, and several paraphrase loops (e.g., "the echo valley longing" is named three times without evolving pressure; "facts as barriers/tools" toggles without cost). The final third summarizes the shop outcome in list-like sequential beats ("In the city, he set up... His failure became... He insulated himself less... He wrested a future...") that flatten momentum. Filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw," "He believed") cluster in the middle section without voice motivation. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull immediacy and reduce information density, triggering cumulative deductions (−0.6 baseline for loops/stems, −0.3 for filter stacks, −0.5 for summary-heavy final third).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ex-roadie appraiser combination and the speaker-grille-cloth pivot offer a fresh synthesis, and the niche of music memorabilia authentication feels specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—failure → isolation → epiphany → new purpose—follows a familiar template (derivative premise guardrail applies), and the shop-success montage resolves the tension tidily without sustained risk or ambiguity. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from bold choices at closure (no lingering cost, no friction in the new venture), and the "echo valley longing" metaphor, while evocative, is named rather than embodied in action. The speaker cloth itself is the most original inflection, earning partial credit, but overall the trajectory feels median rather than daring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo appears in every beat. His choice to write in the ledger (~60% mark) and his decision to leave the trailer and open a shop (~75% and final third) are key turns that alter tactics and options. Setup is immediate (first line), development occurs in the ledger scene, and payoff is the departure and shop establishment. The character drives causality and closure, and removing "ex-roadie turned appraiser" would break the logic of blending skills for memorabilia. Cost is implied (leaving the quarry, risking a new niche) but not deeply dramatized on the page, keeping this shy of 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth appears in at least five distinct beats: introduced on the desk, picked up and felt (~25%), linked to Crimson Dawn tour facts (~40%), designated as "first exhibit" (~70%), rests in his pocket during the drive (~80%), and referenced as "touchstone" and "weave" in the final paragraph. Setup is early (first third), development occurs when Leo handles it and assigns it symbolic weight, and payoff is its role as exhibit/touchstone. It enables the decision to curate music history and charges the closure image ("the weave of a speaker grille cloth scrap"). However, its causal pressure is moderate—Leo could have chosen another relic with minor edits—and the cost tied specifically to the cloth (versus any memorabilia) is not sharp on the page, capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the applause" is named in the opening ("the silence after his public failure"), recurs as a thematic anchor ("After the applause, there was always the quiet work"), and reappears transformed in the closure ("he felt the applause not as memory, but as momentum"). Setup is immediate, development occurs when Leo reflects on packing up after shows (~50%), and payoff reweights the concept in the final beats. The concept shapes stakes (Leo's need to move beyond the applause-driven life) and the ledger-writing turn is framed as mastering "the moving on," so it does alter options. Cost is conceptual (letting go of the crowd's validation) but largely told rather than shown in a choice with visible trade-off, keeping this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is named twice (opening and ~30%) as a label but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Leo is described as "sure of his expertise yet deeply unsure of his path," but no scene shows him attempting a confident appraisal that fails due to uncertainty, or hesitating at a key choice because of this contradiction. The trait is present (setup in first third) but ornamental—removing it would not break any turn or closure beat. No development or payoff beyond label mentions, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears three times: "wrest meaning from this emptiness" (~35%), "wrest this new purpose from his past" (~65%), and "wrested a future from the past" (~85%). Setup is early, and the action is tied to Leo's decision to repurpose his roadie history for the shop, which is a major turn. However, "wrest" is used as a synonym for "extract" or "claim" rather than a distinct, physical, or tactical action that requires specific effort or cost on the page. Swapping "wrest" for "build," "forge," or "claim" would not materially alter the beats, so irreplaceability is low. Present in closure (final third mentions) but not causally indispensable, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is named (~20%: "To insulate himself emotionally, he recited facts about the Victorian inkwell") and recurs (~50%: "He insulated himself with more facts... these facts were just barriers against pain" and ~85%: "He insulated himself less now"). Setup is early, development shows Leo using facts (hallmarks, tour details) as a coping mechanism, and the final mention signals his shift away from the method. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in a choice—no scene where reciting facts costs him an opportunity or where dropping the method enables a new tactic. The method shapes his internal state but does not pressure a key turn with visible trade-off, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is introduced immediately, described with vivid detail (dim, cluttered, grimy window, stark rock faces), and Leo's movement within it (desk → window → desk) is choreographed cleanly. The setting mirrors his "hollowed-out spirit" and the decision to leave the trailer is the story's hinge (~75%). Setup is immediate, development occurs as Leo uses the space to reflect and write, and payoff is the departure ("the trailer shrinking in his rearview mirror"). The trailer constrains by isolating Leo and charges the closure image (leaving = leaving the old self). Minor gap: the city shop in the final third is summarized without spatial texture, but the trailer itself does enough work to cross into 6.0+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" is established in the opening and the failure at the regional antiques fair is detailed (~mid-section: "The collector's disdainful correction echoed"). The timeframe anchors Leo's present state (quarry exile as penance) and the opening line ("the silence after his public failure ringing in his ears") signals recency. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no deadline, no clock pressure, no sense that time is running out for Leo to act. The past failure motivates but does not constrain present tactics. Setup is clear, development is implicit (the failure's echo drives the ledger moment), but no payoff where time pressure alters a choice, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is named in the opening ("His motivation was to discover purpose after loss") and drives every major beat: the ledger writing, the decision to leave, the shop plan, and the closure line ("He had discovered purpose after loss, in the weave of a speaker grille cloth scrap"). Setup is immediate, development occurs when Leo writes and sees "a purpose: to preserve the unseen histories of road life" (~65%), and payoff is the shop establishment and final reflection. The motivation is dramatized in the ledger scene (writing until "facts gave way to feelings") and shown in conflict (yearning vs. emotional insulation). However, the cost of pursuing this purpose—what Leo gives up or risks—is told more than shown (no friction in the shop montage, no visible sacrifice), capping just shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is named three times (opening, ~35%, ~80%) and modulates from "deep yearning for what was gone" to "no longer just yearning; it was a call to action" to "He was no longer lost in its emptiness." Setup is early (first third), development shows the tone shifting as Leo acts (ledger writing, decision to leave), and payoff reconfigures the longing as momentum in the closure. The tone is coherent and supports the melancholic-to-hopeful arc, and it charges the final image by showing Leo's relationship to the past has changed. However, the label "echo valley longing" is more named than embodied—no specific sensory or syntactic pattern consistently evokes the tone beyond the metaphor itself, so the effect is thematic rather than textural, mid-6s.</comment>
