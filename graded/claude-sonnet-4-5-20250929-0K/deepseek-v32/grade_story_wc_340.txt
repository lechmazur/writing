<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("warmly inquisitive nature" shown through dust-mote observation). The final choice to return the artifacts is motivated, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral—he gains warmth but forfeits personal possession without struggle. Internal contradiction is light; his curiosity flows smoothly into curatorial instinct without competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present but somewhat muted in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates imagery and warmth through the elevator's climb, shifting from duty to private warmth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Kael restores the artifacts, foreclosing possession with the cost of remaining a transient curator rather than keeper. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. The lens holds; one meaningful deepening occurs as Kael moves from observer to participant in the captain's gift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elevator's brass-and-frosted-glass interior, the cracked lens casting fractured light, and the spire's pinnacle vista are vivid and purposeful. The goggles' amber lens filters perception, directly altering Kael's experience and enabling the diary's unlock—environment constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography (girder, ceiling lamp, elevator chime progression) tracks cleanly across the ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Kael's shift from mechanical duty to seeking warmth beneath the captain's anguish. The discovery of the goggles initiates a tightening; holding the diary to the light and choosing to return it deepens his stance. The cost is visible in his acceptance of "affectionate detachment"—he gains private warmth but remains a servant passing through. Agency is decision and attention with on-page consequence, though no high-stakes reversal tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty and warmth in solitude, affectionate detachment as shield—emerges from the captain's log entries and Kael's final act of curation. The goggles' amber tint and scattered light reweight the spire's loneliness into shared wonder. The ending image (elevator descending, light dancing on the clasp) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: warmth endures in transit, not possession. No thematic statement intrudes; the particulars (cloud-berry tea, guy-wire harp) ground the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "a needle of ice and iron," "ghost in the glass," "liquid honey." Perceptual signature is selective (dust motes, light play) and biased toward warmth. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Kael reads the log. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—shorter beats at discovery, longer at reflection—without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("storm of crystallized rainbows," "molten gold at sunset"). Minor scaffold: "his motivation not of mere duty, but to seek out the joy" reads slightly expository mid-beat. "Affectionate detachment" recurs three times, bordering on churn. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the accumulative lens. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character. Figurative language is dense but coherent, not muddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-by-scattered-light mechanism is fresh and specific. The frame—ascending servant finds a captain's relic—transforms a familiar discovery arc through the amber-lens solve and the choice to leave the gift for "the next warmly inquisitive heart." Emotional particulars (cloud-berry tea, guy-wire harp) avoid generic templates. The piece commits to its accumulative lens without hedging. Risk is moderate: the design is coherent but does not radically subvert conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael (ascending servant) is present throughout and his choice to return the artifacts alters his stance from duty-bound to curator. The role shapes his discovery (elevator transit, not a fixed keeper) and his final act. However, "ascending servant" is largely a transit frame; the role's constraints do not visibly narrow options or impose a felt trade-off beyond his existing curiosity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The goggles appear early, are handled twice (slipped over eyes, used to decrypt), and return implicitly in the final image (the light still dancing). The cracked lens enables the scatter-light method, making the object causally necessary. Removing the goggles would break the solve and the warm-lens motif. They charge the closure by seeding the next discovery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is the central object; its discovery and decryption shape Kael's entire arc. The encryption method (light through cracked lens) is specific and dramatized. The diary's revelations (Elara, the captain's anguish) reweight Kael's understanding and drive his final choice. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. Slightly lowered because the concept is shared with the goggles' mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is shown (studying dust motes, reaching for the goggles) and enables the discovery and solve. The trait constrains his choice to restore rather than keep—he extends curiosity into curation. Cost is conceptual: he forgoes possession to serve the next seeker. The attribute appears in both action and final reflection, shaping tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" operates literally (angling the diary to the light) and metaphorically (unfolding the captain's story). The action drives the middle turn and enables Kael's realization. It is signaled and specific. However, other phrasing ("reveal," "decode") could substitute with minor edits. The action is purposeful but not wholly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scattered-light method is signaled early (ceiling lamp), taught mid-story (beam through cracked lens casting dots), and executed on the page. The mechanics shape the solve and constrain Kael's approach—he must angle the book, not simply open it. Removing this method would break the encryption and the motif of fractured beauty. It charges the final image (light still dancing on the clasp).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire and elevator provide the transit frame, isolation motif, and the ten-floor timeframe. The setting's verticality and loneliness press Kael's discovery and final detachment. The spire's pinnacle vista offers the breathtaking closure image. The elevator's confined space makes the hidden goggles plausible. However, the setting does not materially alter tactics; it is more crucible than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb structures the narrative and provides a ticking clock (five-floor chime, tenth chime). The timeframe tightens Kael's window to examine the diary and shapes the choice to restore it before arrival. However, the clock does not dramatically narrow options or force a trade-off; it is more pacing device than pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—"to seek out the joy beneath the anguish"—is stated and then dramatized through his choice to read the log entries and restore the gift. The friction is light (duty vs. curiosity), but the motivation shapes his final stance: affectionate detachment as a way to hold warmth without possession. The cost is conceptual (foregoing ownership) and felt in the quiet joy he carries down.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is woven throughout: the captain's stance toward Elara's sky-love, Kael's choice to curate rather than keep, and the final image of private warmth without possession. The tone modulates from steely observation to warm reflection and back to clean light, charging the closure. It is coherent under pressure and recurs in the log and Kael's final posture, making it nearly indispensable.</comment>
