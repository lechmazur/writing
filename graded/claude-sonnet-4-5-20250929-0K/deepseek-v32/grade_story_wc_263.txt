<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to free trapped creativity is stated but her interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("deep creative silence," "winter") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The dream sequence and journey north establish agency, but the peak beat—adjusting the orrery—reads as mystical alignment rather than difficult choice with visible cost. The grandfather's memory provides thematic insight but functions as epiphany without on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is thin; most feelings are labeled ("shadowed rapture," "painful awe") rather than shown through perception and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by paragraph two (Elara, orrery, creative block). The story accumulates density through dream repetition and northward journey, landing closure when the orrery spins and stars reverse—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence within her is replaced by "murmuring, unspoken words"). However, the reversal of stars and orrery's autonomous movement read as convenience: no prior rule explains why her alignment would trigger this mystical payoff. Cost is asserted ("profound and necessary exhaustion") but not legibly dramatized in a choice or forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered ("veils of emerald and violet light," "cathedral of fleeting light") and grounds the climax spatially. The orrery's tactile presence ("warm to the touch" at the end vs. "frozen" gears earlier) subtly tracks her internal shift. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's cosmic idiom. The frozen ground and "star-pierced sky" create atmosphere without catalog excess, and the archway's spectacle constrains her final act by providing the visual map she traces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elara moves from passive dreaming to active tracing, and the orrery begins to turn autonomously. However, escalation depends on mystical mechanics (the archway flares, stars reverse) rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The reversal feels granted rather than earned through a trade-off or visible cost. No clear price is paid on the page; exhaustion is told, not shown altering later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—creativity as "remembered stardust" waiting to be rekindled—emerges through the grandfather's memory and the stellar metaphor threading the piece. The final image (orrery warm, mind "alight with constellations") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Yet the epiphany arrives via mystical alignment rather than concrete struggle, and "unspoken words" recurs as a label without sufficient dramatization. Subtext operates in the dream imagery, but the thematic payoff leans abstract rather than grounded in specific choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, maintains stable distance. Diction is consistently elevated and cosmic ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture," "cathedral of fleeting light"), matching Elara's artistic sensibility. Perceptual signature is clear: she hears "unspoken words" and perceives beauty as "painful awe." However, under peak pressure the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency, and "unspoken words" appears three times without evolving meaningfully. No dialogue; voice is coherent but uniform across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("swirling nebulae," "continuous stream of dying stars"), but density issues emerge. "Shadowed rapture" appears twice in close proximity; "unspoken words" recurs three times without added pressure. The phrase "a universe of murmuring, unspoken words" in the final paragraph is near-paraphrase of earlier mentions. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she felt," "she knew"). Sentence openings vary, but some stems repeat ("She traced," "She packed"). Peak beats carry metaphorical weight without obscuring clarity, yet cumulative loops and stock cosmic phrasing lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—creative block healed by mapping falling stars with an heirloom orrery—offers a fresh synthesis of grief, artistry, and cosmic metaphor. However, the execution follows a familiar template: prophetic dream → journey → mystical solution. The orrery's autonomous spinning and the stars' reversal feel convenient rather than inevitable. The grandfather's "stardust" insight is earnest but borders on platitude. Transformation is limited; swapping the orrery for another heirloom device would require only minor edits. Risk-taking in tone and imagery is present, but the resolution lacks non-obvious calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her journey north is motivated, but her agency at closure is passive: she adjusts the orrery by "instinct," and the reversal happens to her rather than through difficult choice. She decides to travel (one turn) but the climax reads as mystical alignment rather than decision-driven change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orrery appears in paragraph one ("brass orrery…frozen gears"), is packed and carried north, used at the archway to trace star paths, begins to turn autonomously, and returns "warm to the touch" at the end. It shapes two beats (middle tracing, closure reversal) and its state-change (frozen → warm) charges the final image. Removing it would break the story's central mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is seeded via the grandfather's memory mid-story and frames the thematic answer (creativity not trapped, just rearranged). It reweights the stake but does not constrain on-page choices; Elara's actions would proceed identically without this insight. Present in closure paragraph, offering lyric resonance, but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" appears three times: as a trait in paragraph one, during the dream ("a voice that was not a voice"), and when she listens "with her inner ear" while tracing stars. It enables her method but lacks visible cost or constraint; no scene shows what she sacrifices or misses by hearing this way. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rest" is the prescribed action after the archway flares and reversal completes. It appears in the final third: "she knew the action now was simply to rest." She sleeps and wakes with silence replaced by murmuring words. The rest follows rather than drives the turn, but the dreamless sleep contrasts the earlier dream-loop and her waking state is the closure payoff. Present in closure, causally downstream.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tracing falling star paths is seeded in the dream ("if she could map their descent"), becomes the explicit method at the archway ("she began to adjust the orrery's gears, aligning them…to the path of that falling light"), and spans multiple beats ("She traced star after star"). The method is signaled early, executed on-page, and its completion triggers the reversal. Removing it would break the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway appears in the dream for seven nights, Elara travels to find it, and it is the spatial anchor for the climax. Its apex emits falling stars, providing the visual map she traces. The archway's flare at closure ("The archway flared…stars reversed") is essential to the reversal. It constrains her action (she must position the orrery there) and charges the final image. Present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unwritten calendar" appears in paragraph one ("a winter that had lasted across an unwritten calendar of hollow days") and at the end ("The unwritten calendar now held its first mark"). It provides lyric bookend and thematic closure but does not tighten decisions or create on-page time pressure. The seven-night dream and "weeks of travel" are mentioned but not tracked. Ornamental use; swappable with other time metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to free trapped creativity is stated early ("a specific, burning need to free the trapped creativity she felt crystallizing inside her"), drives the journey north, and is referenced at closure ("The creativity she sought wasn't trapped; it was sleeping"). It shapes the dominant stake and is present in closure realization. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicting choices; no on-page friction shows cost or competing wants. Present in setup and payoff, weaker in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" appears twice: first describing her dream-wake feeling ("a feeling of shadowed rapture, a painful awe"), then the archway itself ("The spectacle held a shadowed rapture, magnificent and lonely"). The oxymoron (shadow + rapture) coheres across the piece: beauty laced with loneliness and pain. Tone modulates from hollow silence to "perfect and terrible beauty" to quiet fulfillment, charging the final image without flattening into single-note awe. Present early and at closure, reweighting the stake.</comment>
