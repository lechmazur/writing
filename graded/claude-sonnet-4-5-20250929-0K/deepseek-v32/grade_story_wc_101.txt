<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his "gently persistent" stance is embodied through listening and measured argument. His interiority shows him balancing push and yield, though the leap to trust in anonymous donors feels slightly under-motivated given the elders' "older betrayals." Miren's arc from distrust to pledge is functional but her internal shift happens largely off-page between her objection and her offer. The emotional stakes are present but the council's collective turn lacks individuated friction that would make the change feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a Causal lens: Kael's deduction (dockworker knot, market honey) motivates the reversal from suspicion to reciprocity, and the decision to "declare" their presence through counter-donations narrows options with visible cost (spending reserves, risking exposure). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the bell's ring and the weeks-long exchange reweight isolation into "a node in a hidden, resilient web"—with felt cost (reserves spent, continued risk). The causality holds and the ending image charges prior material. One meaningful tightening is present and the lens remains stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is vividly rendered ("amphitheater-like curve," "dormant vines") and grounds the council scene spatially. The "amplified quiet" is a strong atmospheric choice that modulates with pressure. The ridge/city geography is clear and the arbor's shelter matters for the gathering, though the arbor itself does not constrain a tactical choice. The sanctions period is felt through "shadows and silence" and scarcity, and the city's "wounded districts" are specific enough to ground the reciprocal exchange. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—building intergenerational unity before winter fractures the community—is signaled early and drives the council's debate. Kael's revelation that donations come from suffering neighbors is a meaningful reversal that narrows options: they can no longer passively receive. The decision to reciprocate with their own reserves and skills is agency with on-page cost (reserves spent, elders and youth both contribute). The "one by one, pledges were made" beat dramatizes the transformation and the weeks-long exchange deepens the stakes into a "hidden, resilient web." Escalation is coherent under the Causal lens and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the anonymous exchange: "community is a choice we make, even here, even now." The sanctions as isolation versus the "relentless economy of care" is a strong thematic spine, and the final image of Kael as "a node in a hidden, resilient web" resonates without stating a moral. The bell's shift from "profound change" marker to a declaration of shared humanity is purposeful. However, the phrase "community is a choice" in Kael's speech edges toward thematic summary, and the closing line "a future being built, one silent, mutual gift at a time" tips slightly into abstraction rather than letting the image fully carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Kael's perceptual signature (the bell's "smooth, cold metal," his observation of "distinctive knot" and "type of honey") is specific and selective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven—Miren's "These donations could be a trap" and Kael's counter-argument carry subtext and advance the debate. His diction ("gently persistent," "relentless economy of care") fits a leader's register without slipping into abstraction. The only minor slip is "amplified quiet" recurring as both narrator observation and thematic marker, which occasionally blurs the line between Kael's perception and authorial commentary, but it remains largely voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "map of shadows and silence," "the note that spilled out was pure and clear." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, there are minor artifacts: "The amplified quiet of the ridge, a stillness that seemed to listen" in the opening is echoed by "A profound silence followed, different from before. It was an amplified quiet" later, creating a light paraphrase loop. The phrase "gently persistent" appears twice as a descriptor. The closing paragraph ("The amplified quiet now hummed with a future being built, one silent, mutual gift at a time") stacks abstractions slightly. No major scaffold or filter-verb issues, but these touches prevent entry into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise—exiles and suffering citizens exchanging anonymous aid during sanctions—is a thoughtful synthesis and avoids the "aid from above" trope by making both sides givers. The deduction method (knot, honey) is a small but specific detail that earns the reversal. However, the sanctions-exile setup and the council-debate structure are familiar, and the transformation relies on a single interpretive leap rather than a sequence of surprising discoveries. The emotional arc is honest but not startlingly fresh. The story commits fully to its premise and the reciprocal exchange feels inevitable in hindsight, which elevates it within the band, but it does not take bold structural or perspectival risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, frames the opening stake, drives the council turn with his deduction, and makes the key decision to reciprocate. His choice to ring the bell and his final stance as "a node in a hidden, resilient web" anchor closure. The character's leadership and inference shape all three major beats (revelation, declaration, ongoing exchange). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The silver bell appears in the arbor scene (carried, described, lifted, rung) and is mentioned in the opening ("profound change"). Its ring "gave [the quiet] a shape and a purpose" and marks the decision to declare presence. However, it does not return in the weeks-long exchange or the final image; the closure focuses on the web metaphor and the ongoing gifts, not the bell. Two-beat use (setup + council declaration) with thematic charge, but no payoff reprise at closure. Functional and purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Anonymous donations drive the entire plot: they are the mystery that prompts Kael's investigation, the evidence (knot, honey) that enables his deduction, and the model for the reciprocal strategy. The weeks-long exchange of anonymous gifts is the story's resolution and charges the final image of the "hidden, resilient web." The concept shapes stakes, tactics, and closure. Essential across all beats and the ending would fail without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is used twice as a descriptor of Kael's posture and is dramatized in his council approach: "He had learned that pushing too hard broke trust, but yielding meant stagnation." His measured listening and low-but-carrying voice embody the trait. However, the trait does not visibly constrain a choice with cost—his persistence succeeds without notable friction or tradeoff. The trait shapes tone and tactics in one key beat (the council argument) but does not alter the outcome or impose a felt price. Functional in one beat, no closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Declare" is the pivot word and action: Kael's statement "We must declare our presence" redefines the community's stance from passive recipients to active reciprocators. The bell is rung to "declare," and the subsequent weeks of counter-donations enact the declaration. The action is irreplaceable—without it, the story remains in suspicion and passivity. It drives the major turn and shapes the ending. Essential to two beats (decision + ongoing exchange) and the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are established early as the community's risky method and Kael references them in the council scene: "Our midnight runs showed us the city's wounded districts." The plan explicitly continues them "but now they would carry gifts both ways." The method shapes the reciprocal strategy and the weeks-long exchange. However, no single midnight run is dramatized on the page—the method is told and summarized. Shapes two beats (backstory context + plan) and ongoing closure, but lacks on-page dramatization. Essential in outline, mid-band for execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is vividly described and houses the entire council scene; its "amphitheater-like curve" and the "amplified quiet of the ridge" create atmosphere. However, the arbor does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—the scene could occur in any gathering place. It is present in setup, middle debate, and mentioned in the epilogue ("stand in the arbor at dusk"), but it functions as backdrop rather than causal agent. Purposeful and coherent across beats, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sanctions period is signaled in the opening ("turned the city below into a map of shadows and silence") and tightens decisions throughout: the community faces winter fracture, scarcity drives the stakes, and the "wounded districts" suffer under the same sanctions. The timeframe pressures the midnight runs and the reciprocal donations. "Weeks that followed" tracks progression and the sanctions remain the ambient constraint. The timeframe shapes all three beats (setup, council decision, exchange) and charges the closure image of resilience "through the chill of the sanctions period." Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "build intergenerational support before the coming winter fractured them completely" is stated early and drives the entire arc. The council scene dramatizes the friction between elders (remembering betrayals) and youth (distrusting gifts), and Kael's strategy unites both groups through shared purpose. The final image of "more united across generations by this shared, secret purpose" directly fulfills the motivation. The motivation is tested, shapes tactics, and anchors closure. Essential to all beats and the ending validates it with visible cost (reserves, risk).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" appears in the opening ("pressed upon the gathering"), modulates during the council silence ("profound silence...amplified quiet, thick with the resonance of his words"), and charges the final line ("The amplified quiet now hummed with a future being built"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, shifting from oppressive to resonant to charged, and it supports the theme of silent mutual aid. However, the phrase becomes slightly repetitive and edges toward thematic label rather than purely tonal effect. Strong across beats and closure, with minor overuse reducing indispensability slightly.</comment>
