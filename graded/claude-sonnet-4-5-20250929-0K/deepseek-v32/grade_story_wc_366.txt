<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Leo's reticent nature and warmly observant trait are shown in small choices (tracing the rail, careful stacking, noticing the ghost's gratitude), but the motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" arrives late and reads more as a thematic label than an earned internal contradiction. The ghost subplot and letter-chain backstory take up significant space without forcing Leo into a choice with visible cost until the final act. The climactic bottling action is metaphorically coherent but lacks embodied struggle or a foreclosed path—he succeeds without meaningful renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Leo, Cliffside Light, after lamp flickers) arrive promptly. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost finds peace, Leo departs with bottled safety), but the causal chain is soft: the letter appears unbidden, the bottling method is abstract, and no prior choice constrains the final act. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (image layering, cairn + sea glass + bottled glow), yet the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable cost—Leo sails away having won peace cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room, spiral stairs, and gallery are anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail (cold iron rail, glass-paned crown, salt wind). The sea glass at the cairn's peak charges the final image ("gleaming with a luminescent ache"). The lantern room constrains Leo's actions (he must work outside to stack stones, return inside to bottle the glow), satisfying the micro-setting test for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the letter chain's lifeline—is signaled midway, not early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Leo realizes the ghost needs assurance rather than dispelling, narrowing his tactic to bottling safety. The act of stacking stones and bottling glow feels more ceremonial than pressured; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost, and the ghost's departure is cooperative rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (lonely vigilance, communal care across time) emerges organically through the letter chain, cairn messaging, and the ghost's weary duty. The sea glass recurs with shifted meaning (talisman → gift → gleaming ache), and "luminescent ache" weaves sorrow and beauty without moralizing. The bottling of safety is a non-literal answer to the central question, though the ease of resolution softens the resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Leo's perceptual signature (warmly observant, noticing presence and gratitude). Diction is controlled and poetic ("violet sky," "hollow groan," "charged air") without drifting into ornament that obscures clarity. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's "luminescent ache" and "bottled safety" maintain voice coherence, and psychic distance is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and sensory detail is selective (salt wind, cold iron, starlight on waves). Minor Template-cadence slip: "He climbed… He descended… He sat… He poured…" in sequential paragraphs without purposeful pattern. The metaphor of bottling safety via "gentle motion" is abstract but legible; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high in the lantern-room beats, though the ghostly letter's appearance ("though no one had passed") tells rather than shows the mechanism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The letter chain for keepers and the cairn-messaging system offer fresh particulars within a familiar ghost-story frame. The synthesis (reticent courier + anonymous letters + stone messages + bottling safety) feels purposeful but not startling. The ghost subplot and bottling climax lean on archetypal resolutions (weary spirit finds rest, hero departs with talisman) without sharp subversion or lived specificity that would make the outcome feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo (reticent lighthouse supply skipper) is present throughout, makes the stacking and bottling choices, and his reticence colors his lack of dialogue. He appears by end of first third (setup ✓), stacks stones mid-story (development ✓), and bottles safety at closure (payoff ✓). His choices enable the ghost's peace but feel ceremonial rather than costing him a visible tradeoff. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal push toward 7.0; soft agency caps at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sea glass (blue piece) is introduced in paragraph one (setup ✓), placed atop the cairn mid-story as a token (development ✓), and gleams with "luminescent ache" in the final image (payoff ✓). It appears in three distinct beats with reweighted meaning (talisman → gift → sorrowful beauty). Irreplaceability is moderate (any token could serve); causal pressure is low (it does not narrow options), capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is introduced early (setup ✓), drives Leo's role as courier and explains the ghost's need (development ✓), and is named as "lifeline for the living and the dead" at closure (payoff ✓). It frames stakes and motivates Leo's protective action. However, the chain itself does not constrain Leo's final tactic (bottling glow vs. replying); it provides context but does not alter options under pressure, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is labeled twice ("his eyes warmly observant," "his warmly observant nature") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Leo's careful stone-stacking and attention to the ghost's presence show observation, yet no on-page moment trades observance against another need. Setup appears early, but development (a choice enabled/constrained by this trait) and payoff (cost tied to it) are absent, capping at 4.6 per missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Protect" is stated as Leo's action and motivation ("His action was to protect"). He stacks stones to shield the writer from despair (development ✓) and bottles safety to protect the sacred duty (payoff ✓). Two beats + closure linkage + causal pressure (the protection tactic shapes the ghost's release) justify ≥7.0. Swappability is low (no other verb fits the cairn + bottling sequence), but the ease of success (no failed protection attempt) prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stacking stones as messages is introduced early ("method of reply was not pen and paper, but a way of stacking stones"), taught with examples (gratitude, solidarity, warning), and Leo performs it in two beats (cairn = "You are not alone"; adding the final stone at closure). Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. The method's mechanics matter (stone arrangement conveys sentiment), satisfying all three gates and reaching 6.1. Causal pressure is moderate; the stacking does not narrow options but enables the ghost subplot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is introduced in paragraph one (setup ✓), its "pressure of lonely vigilance" and desk-letter placement drive Leo's realization mid-story (development ✓), and the "peaceful light" filling the room at closure is the payoff image (payoff ✓). The room's haunted state constrains Leo's tactic (he must address the ghost, not repair the lamp) and the final glow charges the ending. Three beats + causal pressure + closure linkage justify 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickered out" is anchored in paragraph one (setup ✓) and the subsequent action (climb, read, stack, bottle) unfolds within that window. However, elapsed time is vague (no live clock tightens decisions), and the flicker itself does not recur or shape tactics after the opening. Development and payoff are weak; the timeframe provides context but does not constrain Leo's pacing or final choice, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated explicitly mid-story ("His own motivation, he realized") and Leo enacts it at closure by capturing glow in the bottle (payoff ✓). Setup arrives late (second third, −0.3), development is thin (the motivation does not force a choice between competing wants), and the bottling succeeds without friction. The final image carries conceptual cost (safety now portable, tower dark but protected), lifting the score to 6.3 via lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears in paragraph one ("air holding a luminescent ache"), recurs at closure ("gleaming with a luminescent ache, beautiful and sorrowful"), and weaves through the piece (violet sky, shimmer, peaceful light). The tone modulates with pressure (charged air, warm farewell) and charges the final image with sorrow-and-beauty. Setup ✓, development ✓ (tone shapes perception of the ghost's weariness), payoff ✓ (final sea glass gleam). Coherence + closure linkage + irreplaceability justify 7.8.</comment>
