<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is abstract—"restore a shared balance"—and never embodied through contradictory impulses or a concrete personal cost that would make the choice visceral. His "infinitely patient" trait is asserted but not tested; no micro-choice shows him struggling against impatience or paying a price for his endurance. The final act—thrusting the fork into mortar—reads as a solution rather than a renunciation or earned transformation with visible internal cost. The woman emerging at the end is a consequence, not a relationship under pressure that forces a choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly: Silas, Aethelburg, ancient archway, task before collapse. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: weeks of walking seed returning sounds, culminating in a single perfect tone that weaves a tapestry of life. Closure lands on the page—the archway's weeping dust ceases, sealed by harmony—and the final image of the woman emerging and the "new morning" offers a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Cost is implied rather than dramatized: we do not see what Silas forfeits or what path is foreclosed, only that "his patient task" is "fulfilled." The ellipsis from weeks of walking to the final circuit compresses causality but remains legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway constrains the task—it is the "keystone for the entire valley's resonance" and its weeping dust triggers the final act. The ebony fork and cobblestones are handled across multiple beats, altering Silas's tactics (adjusting pace, angle, circuit). The "wild hush" and the valley's returning sounds (weathervane creak, wind-whisper melody, rain, leaves, goat bell) accumulate sensory particulars filtered through Silas's ear. Spatial choreography is clear: concentric circles, highest point, under the arch. The setting's acoustic properties drive the method and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the town's sonic soul before collapse—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archway's stone begins to weep dust, forcing Silas to summon every echo in a final, furious circuit. Agency is present: Silas adjusts his walks, his pace, the fork's angle, and chooses the moment to slam his boot and thrust the fork. The cost is conceptual and environmental (the collapse averted) rather than a personal forfeit on the page. No reversal tests his commitment; the escalation is accumulative density rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the acoustic metaphor: sound as shared balance, harmony between place and people, the listening quiet versus the forever-collapse. The final image—"the peaceful, listening kind, the quiet between notes in a living song"—reweights the "wild hush" without stating a moral. Silas's task integrates with the theme: he is a needle stitching sound back into the valley's quilt. The returning sounds (bell, rain, leaves, goat, woman's footsteps) are concrete particulars that build resonance. No overt thematic statement mars the ending; the epiphany is earned through weeks of work and the town's remembered voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Silas's ear and patient perception. Diction is elevated but consistent: "drink the light," "needle, stitching sound," "tapestry of audible life." No head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: "slow, deliberate cadence" during the seeding weeks, "rapid, complex percussion" at the climax. Psychic distance tightens appropriately. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "conversation between stone and air and living breath," which read slightly abstract for a bell tuner's interiority, but the perceptual signature—focused on frequencies, resonance, echoes—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is present: "a man of infinitely patient hands and an ear for the world's hidden frequencies" front-loads abstract praise; "ghost town revival in waiting" and "sonic soul" lean toward stock metaphor. The "wild hush" phrase recurs but without tight variation. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative build. Clarity is generally high, but the final paragraph's "conversation between stone and air and living breath" and "the peaceful, listening kind" add figurative density without new information, dulling propulsion slightly. No major loops or scaffold, but cumulative ornament in peak beats lowers density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—bell tuner restores a ghost town via acoustic harmony—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, mysticism, and communal revival. Execution is competent but safe: the town's "remembering its voice, note by fractured note" and the final chorus of sounds are evocative but not surprising. The "ebony tuning fork, black as a starless midnight" and "infinitely patient" lean toward stock phrasing. The transformation of tropes is moderate; the ending's "new morning" and emerging woman feel expected rather than inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural risk or unconventional angle elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas appears in setup (opener), middle (weeks of walking, adjusting pace and angle), and ending (slams boot, thrusts fork, pockets it, takes unburdened step). His decisions—where to walk, how to adjust, when to summon echoes—shape tactics. The final thrust into the keystone is a causal act that triggers the explosion of tone and chorus. However, his interiority remains thin; the choices are tactical rather than morally fraught, and no cost or renunciation is dramatized. Strong causal presence but limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ebony fork is introduced in the opener, struck against his knee at dawn, held during weeks of walking, its vibration seeping into ground. At the climax, he thrusts it into the keystone's mortar, and it becomes "a solid warmth" as the tone explodes. Final image: he pockets "the warm ebony." The fork's mechanics matter—it emits a pure tone, needs a carrier rhythm, charges the arch. It appears across setup, middle, and ending with evolving use and a charged reprise. Cap at 8.4 band: strong integration but the fork does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it is a means, not a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the premise and desired outcome. Setup: "ghost town revival in waiting." Middle: the town "remembering its voice." Ending: "the ghost town revival was not a sudden influx of crowds, but the restoration of a canvas upon which life could be painted again." It shapes stakes but does not create a tactical dilemma or constrain Silas's options; it remains the goal rather than a complicating pressure. Lyric reprise (opening → ending explanation) reweights the stake conceptually but does not drive a beat. Mid-band: one key turn plus thematic resonance, but swappable for "restoration" or "renewal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Infinitely patient is asserted in the opener and echoed at the ending ("infinitely patient, acknowledged each," "patient task fulfilled"). No on-page moment shows Silas struggling against impatience or paying a price for endurance; the trait is label-only. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. Late mention (ending) without middle development or causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup work and middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rebuild is the core action: weeks of walking to "rebuild the town's sonic soul," adjusting walks to guide returning sounds, final circuit to summon echoes, and the climactic "sound rebuilt the town in that moment." Setup, middle (adjusting tactics), and ending (final image of rebuilding via sound tapestry). The action drives multiple beats and the closure image. However, "rebuild" could swap for "restore" or "revive" without altering structure. Strong causal role but moderate irreplaceability. High 7s band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones—is signaled early ("He found his method via the rhythm of footsteps"), executed for weeks ("his boots tapping a slow, deliberate cadence"), adjusted mid-story ("He adjusted his walks, his pace"), and intensified at the climax ("a final, furious circuit, his footsteps a rapid, complex percussion"). The fork's vibration needs this carrier rhythm; the method is causally necessary. It appears in setup, middle, and ending, drives tactics, and is specific. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient archway is introduced as the town's "highest point" and "keystone for the entire valley's resonance," present in setup (Silas senses imbalance there, strikes fork each dawn). Middle: implicit presence as the valley's anchor. Ending: the archway's stone weeps dust (triggering final act), Silas thrusts the fork into its keystone, the tone explodes from the arch itself, and the weeping ceases. The archway supplies the constraint (its failing state) and the resource (the keystone) that alters the outcome. Setup, middle (implied constraint), and ending. Causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability. High 8s band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe—before the collapse—is signaled in setup ("before the collapse he heard humming," "before the forever-collapse"). Middle: "days that bled into weeks" tracks duration loosely. Ending: "The true test came on the morning the archway's stone began to weep… The collapse was imminent." The clock tightens at the climax, forcing the final circuit. Time shapes the ending beat and is referenced in setup and middle, but the tracking is vague (no precise countdown), and the urgency is declared more than dramatized through missed opportunities or narrowing windows. Mid-6s: one key turn (dust triggers final act) plus thematic reprise, but not live on every page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation—to restore shared balance—is stated in setup ("to restore a shared balance he felt was fraying"). Middle: "guiding the returning sounds" reflects the motive in action. Ending: "The shared balance was returning." The desire is present across beats but never conflicted or dramatized as a choice with cost. No moment shows Silas tempted to quit, doubting the balance, or sacrificing something personal. Told more than shown, and no friction between wants and costs. Mid-5s: functional presence but replaceable and not dramatized with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Wild hush is introduced in the middle third ("A wild hush settled over the town"), described as "not an absence of sound, but a gathering of potential." Ending: "The wild hush remained, but it was now the peaceful, listening kind, the quiet between notes in a living song." The tone modulates from gathering tension to peaceful listening, charging the final image. However, it arrives late (not in setup), and the prose outside these moments does not consistently embody the hush. Mid-6s: lyric reprise that reweights the stake, but late first appearance and limited beat involvement cap it below 7.0.</comment>
