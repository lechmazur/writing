<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific—understanding the mathematics of emotion—and her micro-choices (brushing the mosaic, holding the glass eyes, correlating fruit hues) track consistently. The transformation from ambiguous loss to navigable mystery is earned through concrete discovery. However, interiority occasionally slides into abstract declaration ("Her motivation, however, was precise") rather than embodied perception, and the final moment—"her heart a new, complex formula where hope was the dominant variable"—leans toward label-speak at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains causal linkage: mosaic discovery → glass-eye vision → path-sequence calculation → portal opening. Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise—Elara sees Aloysius imprisoned and recognizes her next task—with conceptual cost (he is unreachable across solidified emotion). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the mathematics motif charges the ending). One meaningful tightening occurs when the chipped gaps transform from damage to deliberate message, narrowing options and raising stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly realized through stone fruits, stalactite drip, and moonlight filtering underground. The mosaic tile and glass-eye depressions function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice and enable the portal opening. However, spatial choreography across the orchard path remains vague—no distances, no mapped transitions—and the "vaster" second cavern appears only as vision without tactile grounding, reducing the sense of lived-in space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving Aloysius's ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightens through discovery (mosaic), calculation (fruit-hue correlation), and portal activation. One meaningful escalation occurs when the chipped patterns shift from absence to navigable map, forcing Elara to risk emotional calculus as literal path. The cost is legible: she must "build a bridge of balanced equations," forecloses passive grief, and commits to active rescue. Agency drives the sequence; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mathematics-of-emotion premise without overt statement. The glass eyes, mosaic gaps, and phosphorescent fruit function as a coherent symbolic system rather than token motifs—each constrains choice and charges the closure. The final image of Aloysius as "prisoner of his own beautiful experiment" reweights the loss without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: understanding emotion is not enough; one must navigate it. The "buried optimism" modulates from suppression to "slow, stubborn ascent" with earned progression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature (phosphorescent patterns, formulae for feelings). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though occasional register drift mars high-pressure beats: "sublime imprisonment" and "dominant variable" read slightly elevated for the moment's urgency. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Psychic distance is consistent, but the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("her heart a new, complex formula") reduces immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "The mosaic was a map... Joy was a specific frequency... The path required a sequence" (parallel declarative stems across three beats). The phrase "dovetailed with a memory" uses the required action verb awkwardly as metaphor rather than literal dovetailing. Minor paraphrase loop: "ambiguous loss transformed into a navigable mystery" is restated as "no longer empty, but charged with a problem" within two paragraphs. Propulsion remains clear, but these artifacts prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxidermy, cave orchard, emotional mathematics, and mosaic cryptography feels specific and non-obvious. The "formulae for feelings yet uncatalogued" and "calculus of the heart, made literal" take familiar loss/grief territory into fresh conceptual space. The transformation is earned through world logic and character expertise rather than convenience. Risk-taking in the emotional-mathematics conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the "second orchard" theoretical-grove motif edges toward familiar hidden-realm tropes without full subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (brushing mosaic, using glass eyes, correlating fruit hues, placing eyes in wall depressions) create the key turns. Setup is immediate, middle development includes the calculation sequence, and payoff occurs when she activates the portal. However, "secretive" is not dramatized—no withholding, no concealment under pressure—so the attribute itself remains ornamental. Score reflects strong causal role minus the unused descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass eyes appear in three distinct beats: gift introduction, mosaic-vision use, and portal-key placement. Each use is functional and escalates: first as backstory anchor, then as perception tool that reveals the path, finally as literal mechanism that opens the portal. The object is irreplaceable—no other tool could focus moonlight or reveal emotional resonance. Closure directly depends on the eyes' presence. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss is the engine: Aloysius's unresolved disappearance motivates Elara's entire arc, shapes her orchard work (mathematics of emotion as coping), and transforms on-page from hollow variable to navigable mystery. The concept structures stakes and tactics—she cannot proceed until the mosaic redefines loss as solvable puzzle. Payoff at closure reframes the loss again as "sublime imprisonment," both present and unreachable, with visible cost (she must now build the bridge). The concept is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" appears early as label ("Her work was gently inventive, a quiet magic") and colors the orchard-tending, but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with cost. The trait reads consistent with her methodical calculation and patient correlation of fruit hues, yet no moment hinges on gentleness versus force or invention versus adherence. Functional mood-setting but replaceable with "methodical" or "patient" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears once as metaphor: "The message dovetailed with a memory she had buried." This is the hinge that transforms the mosaic from artifact to map—without the connection to Aloysius's "second orchard" concept, the path remains opaque. The action is irreplaceable in that precise beat, though the verb's use as metaphor rather than literal joinery slightly softens specificity. Setup (buried memory introduced), development (connection made), and payoff (path now navigable) are all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic patterns are introduced early ("chipped pattern beneath the usual silt"), serve as the decryption method in the middle (gaps = path states: melancholy, resolve, fear), and enable the final portal activation (placing eyes in depressions revealed by the map). The method is irreplaceable—no other decryption would require emotional-state sequencing or fruit-hue correlation. Mechanics are taught on the page and shape Elara's attempts. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is present from the opening and provides the fruit-based data Elara needs to decode the mosaic path. The stalactite drip nourishes the stone fruits whose phosphorescent patterns hold the formulae. The underground moonlight (though physically implausible) becomes the mechanism for portal activation. Setting constrains available tools and enables the solution. Payoff occurs when the second, vaster cavern appears. Removal would break the story's logic and resource base.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" anchors the opening and establishes night as the work window. Moonlight later becomes the portal mechanism. However, no clock tightens decisions—hours pass in calculation without urgency, and the timeframe does not pressure tactics. The night setting enables rather than constrains. Functional setup and lyric payoff (moonlight beams), but mid-scene development and live deadline are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to understand the mathematics of emotion—is introduced immediately, drives the orchard work (compiling formulae from fruit patterns), and dictates the solution method (correlating hues to emotional states, plotting the path as calculus). The desire is dramatized through concrete choices (studying, correlating, calculating) and faces friction: the ambiguous loss she cannot yet solve. Payoff reframes the motivation: understanding alone is insufficient; she must navigate emotion to build the bridge. Indispensable across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Buried optimism is introduced explicitly ("Her buried optimism, long suppressed by grief, began a slow, stubborn ascent") and modulates through the sequence: grief dominates early, calculation brings focus, portal discovery charges hope. The final image—"her heart a new, complex formula where hope was the dominant variable"—directly reprises and elevates the tone. Coherent through turns, though the label-heavy final phrasing slightly reduces embodied charge. Tone shapes the emotional arc and contributes meaningfully to closure.</comment>
