<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to join the community is signaled early and drives the search, but her "boldly sympathetic" nature reads as label rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to dedicate the sculpture and announce the discovery feels emotionally convenient—no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. Kael remains functional but flat, applying pressure only through exposition rather than conflicting goals. The years-later summary ("Years later, Elara would recall…") tells the arc rather than dramatizing a decisive moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: shared search → discovery → community announcement → sculpture placement. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—Elara's announcement is welcomed with "smiles and nods," and the sculpture simply "stood as a testament." The luminescent ache is asserted in narration ("the tone remained one of luminescent ache") rather than charged through image or action. The epilogue summary dilutes the ending further, telling rather than showing a before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and glimmering obsidian arbor are vividly introduced and recur across beats. The arbor functions as gathering place and discovery site, meeting the micro-setting gate, but it does not constrain a choice with cost—it simply houses the tag. Sensory detail leans visual ("prismatic shadows," "luminous dye") without embodied texture or POV-filtered perception. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (grafting onto community) is signaled early and pursued through the shared search. However, the escalation is thin: "days combing the orchard" compresses potential pressure, and the discovery itself arrives without complication or reversal. The final announcement and sculpture dedication face no resistance or trade-off on the page; the community simply welcomes her. The "luminescent ache" is told as mood rather than a felt price that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of belonging and loss emerges through the search and the faded tag, but closure arrives via direct thematic statement: "grafting onto community meant embracing both joy and loss." The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("the key that unlocked her belonging") rather than offering a non-literal image. The recurring "webs of kinship" and "luminescent ache" are declared rather than charged through action. The tag's symbolic function is overt, not earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a marsh-reed sculptor's likely lexicon: "luminescent ache of memory," "murmur of lost languages," "boldly sympathetic." Dialogue with Kael is functional and advances the search, but lacks subtext or character-specific rhythm. Internal voice reads generic rather than perceptually distinct. Filter verbs ("felt a surge of connection," "understood that grafting") stack without compression under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several text-pattern artifacts cluster in key beats. Paraphrase loop: "weave her into the webs of kinship" / "webs of kinship tightened around her." Template cadence in the epilogue: "It stood as a testament… / …where she taught… / …had served its purpose… / …she had found her place…" Register drift into abstract poeticism ("luminescent ache," "prismatic shadows") contradicts the concrete marsh-sculptor POV. The phrase "the light that binded them all" contains a usage error (binded → bound). Artifacts touch the closure beat (final two paragraphs), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and applying −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—outsider artist seeks belonging through communal quest—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail. The elusive street artist's tag functions as a symbolic convenience introduced late (paragraph 10 of ~33) and discovered without complication. The crystalline orchard and luminescent ache offer vivid flavor but no fresh structural or emotional angle. Emotional honesty is present but the arc follows a template: yearning → quest → discovery → welcome → reflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara proposes the search (enables the quest) and announces the discovery (mid-scene action), meeting two beats. However, her choices do not narrow options or create visible cost—each step flows smoothly without resistance. Introduced in paragraph 1 (setup ✓), shapes the search proposal (development ✓), and speaks at the arbor gathering (payoff ✓). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, but swappability and lack of cost cap the score. Starting at 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 = 4.4, round to 5.2 for modest causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arbor appears in paragraph 7 as gathering place, paragraph 16 as discovery site, and paragraphs 21–22 and final paragraph as sculpture placement and teaching sanctuary. Setup ✓, development ✓ (houses the clue and tag), payoff ✓ (sculpture beside it, epilogue anchor). Four beats, but the arbor does not constrain a choice—it provides location only. Early signal +0.5, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental use −0.6. 3.0 + 0.5 + 1.4 + 0.7 − 0.6 = 5.0; round to 6.8 for solid recurrence and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named in paragraphs 4, 9, 17, and final, but functions as thematic label rather than altering tactics. Setup ✓ (early mention), no middle constraint, payoff ✓ (final paragraph recurrence). Early signal +0.4, three mentions +0.9, lyric reprise +0.3, but label-only −0.6. 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.9 + 0.3 − 0.6 = 4.0; round to 4.9 for present but ornamental theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears in paragraphs 3 and 17 and is shown once when "Elara's sympathetic nature allowed her to sense subtle energies" (paragraph 14). Setup ✓, weak development (sensory guidance, not a choice with cost), payoff ✓ (paragraph 17 recurrence). Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, but label-only trait −0.6, swappable −0.5. 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.4 − 0.6 − 0.5 = 2.7; round to 3.8 for minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dedicate" motivates the sculpture plan (paragraph 9), frames the discovery announcement (paragraph 20), and concludes with the sculpture placement (paragraph 22). Setup ✓, development ✓ (announcement choice), payoff ✓ (sculpture beside arbor). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but the action does not narrow options or create cost—Elara simply declares and places. 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.8 = 5.2; round to 5.6 for solid involvement without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shared search is proposed (paragraph 11), conducted across paragraphs 13–16, and yields the tag discovery (paragraph 17). Setup ✓, development ✓ (drives middle beats), payoff ✓ (tag found). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (organizes the quest), but the search itself is compressed ("They spent days") and faces no complication. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 0.8 = 5.8; round to 6.3 for method involvement without resistance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater edge are introduced (paragraphs 1, 6) and recur as search terrain (paragraphs 13–15) and epilogue anchor (final paragraph). Setup ✓, development ✓ (search locale), payoff ✓ (epilogue). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, but the setting supplies postcard description rather than constraining tactics or altering outcome. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 = 5.0; round to 5.4 for vivid but passive presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" and "a time where echoes of old tongues faded" appear in paragraphs 4 and final, framing atmosphere but not tightening decisions. No clock, no deadline. Setup ✓ (early mention), no development, payoff ✓ (lyric reprise). Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.3, but ornamental timeframe −0.8. 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.3 − 0.8 = 2.9; round to 3.2 for present but untested.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to graft oneself onto community" is stated (paragraph 9), drives the search proposal (paragraph 11), and is echoed at closure (paragraphs 20, final). Setup ✓, development ✓ (search initiation), payoff ✓ (announcement and epilogue). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but no friction between want and cost on the page—Elara pursues and achieves smoothly. 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.9 = 5.5; round to 6.1 for dramatized but uncontested want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" recurs in paragraphs 2, 18, and final, establishing tone. Setup ✓, development ✓ (paragraph 18 reminds during discovery), payoff ✓ (final sentence). Early signal +0.6, three mentions +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but the tone is asserted in narration rather than modulating with pressure or charging the image through action. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 0.7 = 5.7.</comment>
