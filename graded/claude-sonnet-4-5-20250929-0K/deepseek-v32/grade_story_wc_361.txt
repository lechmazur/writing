<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's jitteriness and steadying at the end create a visible arc, but his internal contradiction never acts *in scene*—he worries, then performs the rite without meaningful hesitation or cost. The moment he kneels and places the pendant reads as smooth compliance rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Elara's teaching cycles through reflection but doesn't create friction against a present impulse. The final steadiness is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden blooms, the pendant crumbles, Kael's understanding crystallizes with the marker shoot left behind—options and meaning reconfigure with visible cost (artifact destruction, routine transformed). Orientation anchors early (courier, ridgeway, aurora, pendant). The vision of Elara supplies the key insight ("germination"), but the turn from delivery-as-transport to delivery-as-planting feels more revealed than causally forced by Kael's prior choices. Cost is legible (pendant destroyed, future deliveries reweighted), but the protagonist's agency in the reversal is low—he receives instruction and enacts it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora, ridgeway moss, and dragonfly-wing pendant constrain the climactic choice: the pendant's vibration with the aurora is the mechanism that triggers germination, and the moss becomes the medium. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Kael's discomfort ("teeth ache," "nerve exposed"). The crystalline shoots and luminous garden charge the final image with purpose-driven specificity. No significant issues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: fulfill the delivery's true purpose (signaled by Elara's teaching and the pendant's thrum). One tightening occurs when the vision reveals "germination" and Kael shifts from transport to planting. However, the escalation is knowledge-driven rather than choice-driven—Kael receives the answer and complies without visible internal trade-off or foreclosed alternative. The garden's bloom and spore release demonstrate consequence, but the cost (pendant destruction) was not a dilemma Kael wrestled with on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (routine as essential trigger for myth, wonder as patient seed) emerges organically from the pendant's function, Elara's teaching, and the garden's cycle. The final image—spores as new pendants, the hardy shoot as marker—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "The wonder was not in the spectacle, but in the realization" flirts with thematic summary but the preceding image earns it. Subtext operates in the sympathetic vibration metaphor and the absent-mentor frame. Minor slip: "coax wonder from the routine" is nearly restated at the end rather than fully reimagined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (jittery, myth-aware diction). Voice modulates with the aurora's pressure ("nerve exposed," "vibrating stillness"). However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with Kael's stated jitteriness: "attributed power," "dilating seconds into experiences rich enough to be memories," "condensed starlight" read more authorial than character-filtered. Free indirect style is mostly clean. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image and pressure. Minor template cadence in paragraph 2: "The pendant… began to thrum… The case grew warm… the wing resonated" uses parallel structure without friction. Stock metaphor "a thread in a story" and "silent fireworks" slightly dilute specificity. "Germination" is explained twice in adjacent beats (Elara's whisper, then Kael's realization). Figurative density is high but remains legible. No loops or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—delivery-as-germination, artifacts as seeds awaiting harmonic keys, myth propagated through routine—is specific and non-obvious. The dragonfly-wing pendant extending encounters to enable past-present overlap is fresh. However, the absent-mentor-leaves-lesson frame and the courier's epiphany arc are familiar scaffolds executed competently but not transformed. The risk of heavy mythic diction is managed but does not elevate into bold territory. Transformation test: plot and arc could migrate to other courier/relic frames with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael (jittery relic courier) is present throughout and performs the key action (kneeling, placing pendant). Setup clear (first paragraph), development limited (receives vision, enacts instruction without internal friction), closure participation strong (plants pendant, watches garden, rises steady). However, his "jittery" trait does not constrain a choice—it describes state, then resolves. Decisions feel more compliance than turn. Two beats (opening transit, planting rite) but no causal pressure where jitteriness forces a trade-off. Score reflects presence across structure but low causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dragonfly-wing pendant: setup (paragraph 1, leadwood case against chest), development (unclasps, describes, vibrates sympathetically with aurora), closure (placed on moss, crumbles to dust, marker shoot remains). Three beats, irreplaceable mechanics (sympathetic vibration with aurora enables germination), closure linkage strong (destruction is the cost). Removing it breaks the story's logic. Cost is visible. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Absent mentor (Elara): setup (paragraph 1, "vanished into the high passes seasons ago"), development (vision in paragraph 2 delivers key instruction), closure (Kael enacts her teaching, becomes carrier of her lesson). Present across structure and shapes the protagonist's understanding. However, her absence itself does not constrain a present choice—her *teaching* does. The concept is more thematic frame than live pressure. Two-gate clear (setup, payoff via vision), development is instructional flashback rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Extends brief encounters (attributed power of pendant): setup implied in paragraph 2 ("dilating seconds into experiences rich enough to be memories"), development (enables Elara's vision to stretch across time, "extended moment"), closure (sustains the garden's bloom long enough to mature and release spores). Specific mechanics matter: without time-dilation, the vision and germination would not cohere. Two beats with closure linkage. Cost indirect but legible (the power is consumed when pendant crumbles). Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Germinate: setup (Elara's vision whispers the word, paragraph 2), development (Kael understands "to begin the growth," paragraph 3), closure (crystalline shoots sprout, bloom, release spores; the verb becomes the climax action). Major turn traces to this action—delivery redefined as planting, the garden's emergence is the story's visual and thematic peak. Removing "germinate" breaks both the rite and the thematic closure. Indispensable; the entire ending depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vibrating sympathetically: setup (paragraph 2, "Elara had called this 'vibrating sympathetically'"), development (pendant resonates with aurora, mechanism explained on the page), closure (intensified vibration triggers moss to glow and shoots to grow; "each plant a resonant structure vibrating in harmony"). The method is signaled early, its mechanics constrain the rite (pendant must be positioned toward zenith), and it shapes the climax. Three beats, high specificity, causal necessity. Removing it breaks the germination logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway: setup (paragraph 1, "narrow path of shimmering moss… between shoulders of ancient, sleeping mountains"), development (moss is the medium where Elara planted seed and Kael will plant pendant; aurora's energy pools there), closure (moss glows, shoots emerge from it, marker shoot remains). The setting is not mere backdrop—the moss and aurora are the rite's necessary substrate and power source. Three beats, irreplaceable. Removing the ridgeway's specific properties (moss, auroral pooling) breaks the germination mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Across the fade from memory to myth: setup oblique (paragraph 1, Elara "seasons ago"), development (paragraph 3, "the timeframe of his journey shifted, sliding across the fade from memory to myth"), closure (spores as "fragment of the myth, destined to be found… to begin the cycle again"). The phrase is lyric rather than tactical—it names the thematic register but does not tighten a decision or deadline. Time is more conceptual scale than pressure. Reprise weak; the phrase appears twice but does not reweight a choice. Lyric seed-and-return score band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To coax wonder from the routine: setup (paragraph 1, Elara's "core teaching"), development (paragraph 3, "motivation crystallized: to use this key, to begin the growth"), closure (paragraph 5, "the routine delivery was the essential trigger… wonder waited, patient as a seed"). Desire is stated rather than dramatized—Kael does not struggle between wonder and efficiency or risk versus caution. The motivation frames the arc but is not conflicted on the page. Two beats (teaching, realization) with closure thematic charge, but low friction. Mid-band for presence without visible cost.</comment>
