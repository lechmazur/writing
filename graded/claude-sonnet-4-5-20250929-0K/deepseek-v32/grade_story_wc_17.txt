<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" is poetic but remains largely abstract throughout. Internal contradiction is minimal—the cartographer moves through discovery beats without meaningful cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The diary revelations generate curiosity rather than forcing a hierarchy of values with visible tradeoff. The final "burden in my heart" is asserted rather than embodied through a specific renunciation or alteration that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discoveries layer (diaries, negative, device) toward a thematic reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. However, closure relies on conceptual repricing ("legacy's burden…responsibility") stated rather than dramatized through a final image that makes cost undeniable. The deactivation sequence offers a micro turn but the ending drifts into thematic summary ("we must remember") without a decisive on-page reconfiguration that charges prior material. Cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage supplies vivid early anchors (damp stone, decay, crack of light) and the device behind the panel creates spatial constraint. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered through the cartographer's sonic focus. The passage functions as both physical container and thematic vessel. However, the environment does not materially narrow a choice at the closure beat—the narrator's departure is contemplative rather than spatially forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: uncovering what walls dream about, then discovering the family's secret experiment. The diaries → negative → device → deactivation sequence provides accumulative tightening under the Textural lens. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is observational and therapeutic (deactivating the device "hoping to lift some of the burden") rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The passage "felt lighter" but no tactical or relational price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden emerges through layered discoveries and the walls-as-memory conceit. The final paragraph attempts resonance ("both our burdens and our hopes") but tips into thematic summary rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The line "legacy's burden is not just memory, but responsibility" is explicit rather than earned through a charged final act. Subtext operates in the diary fragments and the device's "scar on the world," but the ending moralizes instead of deepening ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature tied to sonic cartography. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "sensitively perceptive soul" and "legacy's burden" recur as thematic labels. The piece remains in past tense and maintains coherent focalization. Minor issue: "corridor echo cartographer in me recorded these echoes" splits the narrator into role and self without purpose. No dialogue present. Voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into abstract register at emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate through the discovery sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The passage was choked with green" followed by "a testament to nature's reclamation" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs occur ("I found…I carefully gathered…I felt…I realized…I understood") across multiple beats without pattern-teaching. Stock phrasing: "heart pounding with possibility," "weight of their guilt, a heavy echo." These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure paragraph ("I will continue to listen"), triggering the artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "corridor echo cartographer" premise is fresh and the sonic-memory conceit offers a non-obvious angle. However, the story defaults to a familiar structure: explorer finds diaries → discovers family secret → deactivates device → departs with knowledge. The emotional arc (curiosity → horror → burden) follows a predictable template. The walls-dreaming metaphor is poetic but not transformed through an unexpected final image. Swappability test: the core beats would function unchanged with a different occupation and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present early and in most beats, but the cartographer's decisions are largely observational (gathering diaries, developing the negative, searching for the panel). The deactivation is the one clear choice, but it is framed as "hoping to lift some of the burden" rather than a high-stakes decision that narrows options. The role enables discovery but does not constrain or force a meaningful cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears at midpoint, is processed on-page with tactile detail, reveals faces and the device blueprint, and directly enables the deactivation. Present across three beats with evolving function. However, it resolves a problem (how to deactivate) that it did not help create, and the final image does not recharge it. Swappable with another hidden artifact (e.g., a schematic) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is named early ("legacy's burden that haunted this house"), recurs thematically, and shapes the narrator's interpretation of the diaries and device. It motivates the deactivation attempt. However, it functions primarily as theme label rather than a constraint that alters tactics or forecloses options on the page. The final paragraph states it ("legacy's burden remained in my heart") without a charged image that makes the conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned twice as self-description ("I was sensitively perceptive," "the sensitively perceptive soul felt them deeply") but never demonstrates a visible tradeoff or constraint. The trait does not enable a choice unavailable to others or impose a cost. Label-only integration without embodied friction or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrator glimpses the metallic glint that leads to the fireplace discovery. This beat pivots from listening to physical search and unlocks the diary thread. However, "glimpse" is not irreplaceable—"noticed," "spotted," or "saw" would function identically. The action does not redefine options at closure; it is a functional middle beat without charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace appear early, are physically handled, yield frantic final entries, and reveal the secret experiment that drives the remaining beats. The method is causal: without the diaries, the negative and device remain unknown. Present in setup and development, and their content (blueprint reference) shapes the deactivation at closure. Specificity (half-burned, pages curled) matters on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the entire narrative, supplies vivid sensory detail (damp stone, decay, ivy overgrowth), and conceals the device panel. It recurs across beats and is named in the final third ("The ivy-veiled passage was now a tomb of memories"). However, it does not force a tactical choice at closure—the narrator could leave or stay without spatial pressure. Micro-setting is strong but does not narrow options in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the climate shifts" establishes the world and motivates the family's catastrophic experiment. It recurs thematically ("After the climate shifts, we must remember") in the final line. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no live clock pressures the narrator's choices. The timeframe is backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is named early and recurs in the final paragraph. It drives the initial search and frames discoveries as answers. However, it remains abstract and does not generate visible friction between competing wants. The narrator pursues it without encountering a cost that tests commitment. The motivation is present and thematic but not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>
