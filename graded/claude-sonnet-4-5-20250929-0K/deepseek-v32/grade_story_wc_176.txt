<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a static vessel for the prompt's concept. His motivation ("to preserve the sound of forgotten names") is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or meaningful internal friction. The "after forgiving himself" frame is label-only, appearing in three separate summary clauses without an on-page micro-choice that embodies the cost of that forgiveness or reveals what failure he overcame. Emotional states are told ("tears warming his cheeks," "deep peace") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or perceptual change under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but no closure effect occurs on the page. The rope glows, names sound, ice melts—yet Elias's options, knowledge, or stance do not change in a legible before/after. The ending summarizes accomplishment ("he had found his own redemption") without a decisive act, renunciation, or image that reconfigures meaning with cost. The drive lens reads as intended-Causal (card inserted → rope glows → names preserved), but the final third dissolves into summary and repetition, erasing any tightening or deepening that would constitute closure under that lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid in initial description but become static postcards. The rope, punched card, and ice never constrain a choice—Elias's technical process is asserted ("technically gentle," "precision") but not shown through a tradeoff, tool limitation, or spatial obstacle. The snowmelt at the end is metaphorical decoration rather than a micro-setting element that alters tactics or charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is declared but never tested by opposition, resource scarcity, or a competing need. Elias faces no reversal, complication, or tightening choice; the rope "responds" and "glows" without resistance. The punched card's insertion is mechanical, not a gamble with visible cost. Escalation is absent under any lens: no deepening knowledge, no pattern break, no stance crystallization—only summary narration that the task succeeded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory, preservation, redemption) is stated overtly in multiple lines ("The core concept of transcribed memory was now manifested") rather than emerging from particulars. The final image of the glowing rope is symbolic but lacks the non-literal resonance required for high thematic execution; it literalizes the premise without reweighting it. "After forgiving himself" recurs as thematic echo rather than tension, and the ending moralizes ("he had found his own redemption") instead of trusting image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "tears warming his cheeks," "deep peace," and "snowmelt ardor" repeat without character-specific texture. Diction fluctuates between elevated ("ethereal," "sanctum") and explanatory ("This method, by reconfiguring the braids…"), breaking voice coherence. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("He listened," "He had succeeded," "He walked") without adding immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: lines 6–8 restate the sanctum's ice and Elias's warmth; lines 23–26 cycle synonyms for accomplishment. Template cadence dominates ("He moved…He tightened…He stepped…He walked"), flattening rhythm across 50+ lines. Stock metaphors ("the rope began to glow," "a living archive") and label-only traits ("technically gentle" appears four times without embodied action) dilute density. The final third is pure summary, recycling every prompt element without propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the maximum penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise (lost-wax caster preserves memory via rope braids and punched card) is specific but not transformed—each element is used literally per the prompt checklist. The turns (rope glows, names sound) are asserted outcomes rather than earned complications. No fresh inflection or risk distinguishes this from a straightforward prompt-response; swapping "lost wax caster" for "archivist" or "rope" for "loom" would not alter the emotional or thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elias is named and performs the task, but his choices do not create turns. Setup present; no middle or closure decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The punched card appears in line 4, is inserted in line 13, and disintegrates in line 28. Two beats, but the mechanics are asserted, not dramatized; swappable with any memory-encoding object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" is stated repeatedly (lines 5, 24, 35) but remains thematic label. It does not constrain a choice or tactic; the rope's function is described, not tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears four times (lines 10, 16, 23, 34) as label. No on-page action shows the tradeoff between gentleness and another demand.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" anchors the task and the rope glows in line 17, shaping two beats. The action is present at closure (line 33, 40) but is summary rather than dramatized decision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method (reconfiguring braids) is signaled in line 9, enacted in lines 10–16, and referenced at closure (lines 24, 40). Three beats, but the mechanics are told, not shown as constraint or gamble.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid in setup and present at closure (lines 1, 47), but the setting never alters tactics or supplies a resource/obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving himself" appears in lines 2, 24, 38 as summary frame. It does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; it is label-only backstory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation (preserve forgotten names) is stated in line 3, pursued in the middle, and declared fulfilled in lines 25, 36. Present across beats but never conflicted by a competing want or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears in lines 6, 37, 46 as tonal label. It does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it is metaphorical decoration.</comment>
