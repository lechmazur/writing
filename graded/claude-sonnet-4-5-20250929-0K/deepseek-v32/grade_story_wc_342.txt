<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness constrains her perception in a character-specific way: she reads the coin's topography precisely because she navigates by fractal geometry rather than wholes. Her motivation is clear and singular—to retrieve the pigment recipe and mirror the sky—driving choices under escalating time pressure. Internal texture is consistent; her focus on "fractally precise geometry" and tactile reading feels embodied. Minor weakness: the final choice to "extract their deepest color" is more poetic summary than a dramatized renunciation with visible friction, keeping this shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held: Elara's teacher drilled the code, the coin's indentations guide the panel, the pigment is mixed under instruction, and the demolition clock forces her exit. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she leaves with the pigment as the tree falls, crystallizing the trade-off between saving books and extracting craft knowledge; the cost is legible in "she had not saved the library, nor the books." One meaningful tightening (the crash forcing flight) is sufficient at this length. Strong because/therefore linkage and visible cost keep this in the 8-band, but the final image ("unbroken") leans slightly abstract, preventing entry to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hollowed trunk library is anchored early with vivid detail: "cylindrical room of ancient paper and wood," growth rings, hexagonal panel. Spatial choreography is coherent (pedestal, wall knot, hidden cavity). The environment constrains choice: Elara must find the specific knot and apply pressure with the coin edge. The grove's shaking and the idling machinery outside pressure her exit. Sensory selection is purposeful (candle flame raking the coin, "blue so profound it seemed to pull the very light"). Minor: the setting functions more as vivid backdrop than as a persistent constraint that shapes multiple tactics, keeping this just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: retrieve the pigment recipe before demolition. One meaningful tightening: the "thunderous crash" of the first wall forces immediate flight, narrowing options to grab-and-run. Agency is clear—Elara's tactile skill and the teacher's code enable the retrieval—and the final image shows visible cost: she saves craft, not books. Escalation is driven by protagonist skill under the causal lens. Weakness: the middle sequence (find coin, decode, mix pigment) proceeds smoothly without complication or reversal, which keeps pressure from spiking a second time. Solid execution but lacks the layered tightening or felt tradeoff mid-scene that would push into 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of limits—of perception, art, guild wisdom—emerges organically from Elara's face blindness and the pigment extraction. The final image ("fragment of sky made solid, a crafted answer to the limits of memory and mortar") reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: she places the coin back, a small ritual honoring the guild even as she flees. Weakness: the phrase "discovering limits" appears on-page ("discovering limits—the limits of perception, of art"), nudging toward thematic echo. The ending also leans slightly abstract ("unbroken") rather than a concrete image that non-literally answers the question, keeping this in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is clean and stable; perceptual signature is distinct (fractally precise geometry, tactile reading). Diction matches the studious, reverent POV: "reverent focus," "silent ritual." No head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates with urgency: longer, textured lines during the mixing ("grind midnight sapphire with dawn quartz"), clipped at the crash ("There was no more time"). Minor: a few elevated phrases ("to mirror the sky inside the walls of her own stark studio, a final, impossible commission") read slightly formal for the immediate scene pressure, and "atmospheres" as the book title edges toward symbolic convenience. Overall control is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or action. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports urgency ("She uncorked… She placed… Her flight…"). Clarity is strong; causality is traceable. Weaknesses: a few near-loops and elevated phrasing in the opening third ("a cylindrical room of ancient paper and wood, now holding its breath" / "Her world was one of fractally precise geometry") lean ornamental. The phrase "a universe emerged" is stock metaphor. "Heightened stillness, broken only by the distant growl" uses a passive filter where active perception would sharpen. These artifacts are non-closure and minor, so penalty is modest (−0.6 range), keeping the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The face-blind artist reading microscopic topography is a fresh synthesis of character trait and method; the pigment-as-craft-memory premise offers a non-obvious angle on preservation. Turns feel earned in hindsight (teacher's code, coin map, panel mechanism). Weakness: the guildhall-demolition frame is a familiar ticking-clock setup, and the final line's "unbroken" abstraction edges toward safe poetic closure rather than bold specificity. The story commits fully to its logic and avoids hedging, but the premise and resolution occupy well-trodden thematic territory (art as memory, salvage against loss) without radical transformation. Solid originality, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph one. Development: her face blindness enables the coin-reading beat ("To her fractally precise perception, a universe emerged"). Payoff: her specific skill retrieves the pigment, shaping the closure. Two beats (coin, mixing) with causal pressure. Cost connection: her perceptual mode is the enabler, but the cost is tied to time/destruction, not to a tradeoff inherent in the trait itself. Swappability is low; another character without tactile precision could not decode the coin. Late first appearance −0 (early). Beat involvement +0.9 (two beats). Causal pressure +0.8 (enables key move). Closure linkage +0.7 (shapes final image). Specificity +0.5. Ornamental use −0 (active). Net ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "a thick, leather-bound tome titled 'Atmospheres'" appears early. Development: Elara opens it, retrieves the coin (beat one). Payoff: she returns the coin to the book safe before fleeing (beat two, reprise with reweighted meaning—ritual closure). Two distinct beats with evolving use. Causal pressure: the book safe houses the key, but the safe itself does not constrain further action; the coin does the work. Closure linkage: the return gesture is present but not decisive. Early signal +0.5. Beat involvement +0.9 (two beats). Causal pressure +0.6 (houses key). Closure linkage +0.4 (reprise, not causal). Specificity +0.4. Net ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "discovering limits—the limits of perception, of art, and of the guild's own guarded wisdom" is stated mid-story. Development: the concept is thematized in Elara's realization but does not constrain a middle choice; she proceeds smoothly. Payoff: the ending echoes limits ("crafted answer to the limits of memory and mortar"). The concept frames stakes thematically but does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options in a decision beat. Late first appearance (mid-story, after 40%) −0.4. Ornamental use −0.7 (theme claim, not action pressure). Closure linkage +0.5 (present in final image). Specificity +0.3. Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setup: "fractally precise perception" introduced early. Development: this trait enables the coin-reading beat ("Microscopic pits and ridges, arranged in concentric, spiraling patterns"). Payoff: the pigment she retrieves is the product of that precise perception applied under instruction. The trait constrains her world (face blindness) and enables a key action with visible cost (time pressure, not a tradeoff inherent in the trait itself). Early signal +0.6. Beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: coin, mixing). Causal pressure +1.0 (enables key move). Closure linkage +0.7. Specificity +0.6. Cost connection +0.3 (time cost, not trait cost). Net ~7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "craft" is named in the opening (guild's "crafted knowledge"). Development: the mixing ritual is dramatized in detail ("grind midnight sapphire with dawn quartz"), shaping the middle sequence. Payoff: the crafted pigment is the object she carries out, anchoring the closure ("a fragment of sky made solid, a crafted answer"). Three beats (recipe retrieval, mixing, sealing/exit) with causal pressure. The action redefines the premise from book-rescue to craft-extraction. Early signal +0.7. Beat involvement +1.4 (three beats). Causal pressure +1.2. Closure linkage +1.5 (decisive). Specificity +0.7. Net ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: the coin is revealed early ("a single, tarnished silver coin. This was the key"). Development: "faint indentations" are signaled, and Elara tilts the coin to the flame, reading the topography to locate the wall panel. Payoff: the method shapes the middle sequence and is referenced in the return gesture. Two beats (decode, apply pressure) with causal mechanics. The method is irreplaceable; without the coin's map, she cannot open the panel. Early signal +0.7. Beat involvement +0.9 (two beats). Causal pressure +1.3 (shapes attempt). Closure linkage +0.5 (reprise, not causal at end). Specificity +0.8. Net ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "hollowed trunk… cylindrical room of ancient paper and wood" anchored in paragraph one. Development: the trunk's growth rings and hidden panel provide the physical puzzle; Elara "traced the growth rings until she found a specific knot." Payoff: the tree-library's fall is the closure image ("with a shuddering crack, it began to lean"), reweighting the salvage. Three beats (entry, panel, exit/fall) with spatial choreography that alters tactics. The setting is indispensable; no tree, no hidden panel or final image. Early signal +0.8. Beat involvement +1.4 (three beats). Causal pressure +1.4. Closure linkage +1.6. Specificity +0.8. Net ~8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "at the hush just before dawn, when the condemned scholar's guildhall… were scheduled for demolition" anchored early. Development: "the distant growl of idling machinery" tightens pressure during the mixing. Payoff: "a thunderous crash… the first wall" forces immediate flight. Two beats (setup, crash) with live clock that alters moves. The timeframe drives the urgency and shapes the final image (she flees as the tree falls). Early signal +0.7. Beat involvement +0.9 (two beats). Causal pressure +1.3 (tightens decisions). Closure linkage +1.2 (shapes exit). Specificity +0.6. Net ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "to mirror the sky inside the walls of her own stark studio, a final, impossible commission" stated early. Development: the motivation drives the retrieval, but no mid-story friction arises between the want and a competing cost; she proceeds smoothly. Payoff: the motivation is restated in the final paragraph ("She would mirror that sky on her wall"). The desire is told and frames the action but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible tradeoff in a choice beat. Early signal +0.6. Beat involvement +0.4 (one beat, opening). Causal pressure +0.5 (frames goal). Closure linkage +0.5 (restated, not tested). Ornamental use −0.5 (told, not conflicted). Specificity +0.4. Net ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "in the heightened stillness, broken only by the distant growl" appears mid-story. Development: tone modulates from reverent focus ("silent ritual") to urgent compression at the crash. Payoff: the final image ("she looked back only once… then, with a shuddering crack, it began to lean") charges stillness with motion and loss. Coherent through turns; the quiet contrasts with the demolition to heighten pressure. The tone is consistent and charges the closure. Late first appearance (mid-story) −0.3. Coherence across turns +1.0. Closure linkage +1.4 (charges final image). Specificity +0.5. Net ~7.8.</comment>
