<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's grief-driven motivation is clear and embodied through the lantern-making craft and origami ritual. The polishing work shows his hands and process concretely. However, the arc from raw grief to "weight lift, not gone, but reshaped" feels summarized rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; the transformation is declared more than dramatized. Mira remains an abstraction—"lost love" with no具體 trait or tension that complicates Elian's present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story moves through polishing → projection → folding as a density-building pattern that reweights grief into celebration. Orientation anchors (Elian, floating island, post-shadow-detachment twilight) arrive early. The closure—dream transformed into shadowless cranes, weight reshaped—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + image reweighting) with felt cost (grief remains as "gentle glow"). One weakness: the cost at closure is asserted ("felt a weight lift") rather than shown through a specific on-page forfeiture or tactical change in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass basilica, floating island, and dream-gem setup are vivid and specific. The gem itself constrains the polishing action and charges the final lantern projection. Sensory detail is selective: "luminescent oils," "whisper silver leaves," cranes casting no shadow. The tea garden returns lighter at the end, a spatial echo that supports closure. Minor slip: "perpetual twilight, luminous…yet tormented" leans decorative in the opening without immediate pressure tie-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform Mira's painful final dream into something bearable. The polishing → projection → folding sequence constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The dream-folding visualizes the shift (laughter to birds, tears to dew) with on-page cost (shadowless cranes = acceptance of irrecoverable loss). However, no live opposition or tactical constraint forces a trade-off; the process unfolds without friction, and the "luminous torment" becomes "gentle glow" too smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief transformed through craft, descent as ascent) emerges from the basilica's paradoxical architecture and the folding ritual without overt statement. The final image—cranes soaring shadowless—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: loss honored rather than erased. The "descends while ascending" motif threads polishing (deeper into grief, closer to peace) and the basilica's structure. One slip: "a reminder rather than a wound" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary moralizing instead of letting the image alone carry the reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elian notices craft details (abrasives, luminescent oils, lantern mechanics) and grief-charged images. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("folding grief," "luminous torment"). The dream-folding sequence—"his hands gestured, manipulating the luminous threads"—maintains psychic distance and reflects his artisan lens. Minor template cadence in the opening: "After… sat… The sky… His hands… The tea garden… But…" runs a mechanical subject-swap pattern for three lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. The polishing and dream-folding beats are propulsive. Two frictions: (1) Paraphrase loop at lines 2–3: "perpetual twilight, luminous…tormented by fleeting darkness" and "sky around him" restate the same atmospheric idea without added detail. (2) Stock metaphor "carved a hollow in his world" (line 5) is functional but generic. No artifacts touch the closure beat (cranes soaring, weight reshaped), so penalty remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core synthesis—grief as craftwork, dream-recording via gemstone lanterns, floating-island setting—feels purposeful and internally coherent. The "descends while ascending" paradox and shadowless-cranes closure are specific to this premise. However, the shadow-detachment-as-death mechanic and lantern-maker-preserving-memories frame echo familiar fantasy tropes without a transformative twist in stakes or moral calculus. The piece executes its template well but does not surprise; removing "Elian" and "Mira" and inserting generic names would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian (lantern maker, dream recorder) is present throughout and his craft shapes two beats: polishing the gem (mid) and projecting/folding the dream (end). His decision to transform rather than merely preserve the dream is the story's pivot. However, "crafty" (implying cleverness or ingenuity under constraint) is not demonstrated; the process unfolds without tactical friction or a choice between methods. The character is essential but not "crafty" in execution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in beat one (Elian descends to it), houses the dream recordings and the gem-polishing work (beat two), and hosts the dream projection/folding (beat three). Its paradoxical architecture ("descending into core while ascending into sky") directly mirrors the thematic stakes and is invoked again at closure. The structure is used, not merely described, and its transparent spires catching light in kaleidoscope colors charge the dream-projection moment. It is indispensable to the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream recording is the story's operational mechanic: Elian's livelihood, the method that preserved Mira's final thoughts, and the vehicle for the transformation at closure. It shapes stakes (what to do with a painful recorded dream) and tactics (polishing, projecting, folding). Without it, the entire lantern-and-gem apparatus collapses. The concept is signaled early, developed through the polishing work, and pays off when the dream unfurls and is reshaped. Cost is visible: permanent loss (shadow detached = irrecoverable) met with craft-driven acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is invoked twice: once as the basilica's paradoxical architecture (line 18) and once as Elian's emotional journey during polishing (line 17). It provides thematic coherence and is echoed in the final paragraph's "descent into memory and ascent towards hope." However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or impose a visible trade-off; it remains a metaphoric label rather than a dramatized attribute with cost. Present across beats, purposeful, but not irreplaceable in terms of plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Transform" is the story's hinge action: Elian transforms the dream from painful memory into celebration (lines 26–27). The act is prepared by polishing and executed through folding the luminous threads. It directly produces the closure image (shadowless cranes) and reweights the grief from wound to reminder. The word "transform" is explicitly named (line 27) and the process visualized on the page. Swapping it for "reshape" or "heal" would require rewrites across multiple beats; the action is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early (line 15), detailed with "fine abrasives and luminescent oils" (line 15), and occupies the middle work sequence ("hours of polishing," line 20). It enables the dream projection by clarifying the stone and is the method by which Elian begins the transformation. The process itself reveals Mira's last thoughts (line 16), so it serves discovery as well as preparation. However, once the gem is placed in the lantern, polishing recedes; the climactic work is dream-folding, not further polishing. Essential to setup and middle, less so to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden opens the story (line 1, "plateau of emerald moss and whispering silver leaves") and returns at the end (line 30, "seemed to hover lighter, as if unburdened"). The return marks the emotional shift and provides spatial closure. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is a stage for Elian's origami ritual and a lyric anchor. The garden's lightness at the end is asserted, not causally tied to an on-page action. Functional early–final reprise, but mid-band for lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" sets the inciting past-event (Mira's death/vanishing) and frames Elian's present state. It anchors the story's emotional baseline and the irrecoverability of loss. However, "after" is vague in elapsed time and does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions within the on-page sequence. The timeframe is setup context, not a constraint that shapes tactics. Present and functional, but replaceable with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—folding grief into origami cranes—is named in the opening line, embodied in the stone-bench crane (line 6), and enacted at closure when Elian folds the dream itself into light-cranes (line 26). It drives both the literal action (paper folding) and the symbolic transformation (grief into celebration). The final paragraph returns to crane-folding as an ongoing ritual that balances memory and hope. The desire is dramatized across three beats and carries visible cost (grief persists as "gentle glow," not erased). Strong integration with one friction: the motivation is told as metaphor ("folding grief") before it is shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" appears in line 2 (sky described), line 10 (Elian's dreams), and line 31 (reweighted as "gentle glow"). The oxymoron coheres with the story's aesthetic (beauty in pain, light and shadow) and modulates from raw torment to bearable reminder. However, the tone itself is static across the polishing and folding work; Elian's process unfolds without tonal friction or pressure spikes. The final reweighting ("luminous torment remained, but now…gentle glow") is asserted rather than felt through rhythm or diction shift. Purposeful reprise, but mid-range for lack of enacted modulation under stress.</comment>
