<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and his internal state is embodied through concrete gestures (worrying the cork, the "screaming tenderness"). The emotional arc from desperation to exhausted completion reads credibly. However, the interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("vibration shaped by longing and clarity") that feels more thematic than character-particular, and the captain's sudden memory of his wife's garden—though emotionally resonant—arrives without prior setup of his psychological state, weakening the earned quality of his turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Aris must guide a ship using a method opposed to the Keeper's failed shouts. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dawn, Aris) arrive quickly. The closure—safe passage and the Keeper's dawning understanding—lands on the page with visible cost (Aris's exhaustion, the foreclosed path of loud warnings). The causality is clean within the situational frame: Aris's beckoning produces the scent-memory that turns the captain's wheel. One modest tightening in escalation (the fog rolls in, the captain is lost) suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, pre-dawn indigo sky, and fog are vivid and purposeful. The cork functions as a tactile anchor that constrains Aris's method and charges the final beat when he picks it up again. The sensory hierarchy—jasmine, damp earth, salt air—is filtered through both Aris's memory and the captain's recognition, and the scent itself becomes a constraint that shapes the captain's choice. Spatial choreography (tower climb, lamp room, channel below) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page. The tightening arrives when the fog rolls in and the captain is lost; Aris's beckoning (agency through attention and memory) produces the scent that turns the wheel, a choice that forecloses the path of loud signals. The cost is visible: Aris's exhaustion and the Keeper's recognition that his own methods failed. Under the situational lens, the escalation is coherent and the resolution is earned by Aris's enacted stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme—whispers versus shouts, memory as a purer signal than command—emerges organically from Aris's enacted method and the captain's response. The cork and jasmine scent function as concrete particulars that avoid overt symbolism. However, the final exchange ("No glare." / "No." / "Just a whisper.") and the closing sentence ("Sometimes, the purest signal is not a command…") veer into direct thematic statement rather than trusting the image to resonate. This lowers the score from the high 7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature—Aris's focus on tactile memory, the Keeper's rough pragmatism—is consistent. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "screaming tenderness," "vibrations of intent," and "memory's ghost" elevate the register beyond straightforward narrative voice without clear motivation from Aris's interior state. The dialogue is spare and functional. Under pressure, the prose remains clear, but the elevated figurative load in the opening and middle beats slightly blurs the character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries noticeable figurative density in non-peak beats: "screaming tenderness," "memory's ghost," "spectral scent of peace," "vibration shaped by longing and clarity." Several of these metaphors are abstract or contradictory (screaming tenderness, spectral scent) and appear in most sentences of the first third without clear pattern-teaching. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("Sometimes, the purest signal…") reads as scaffold rather than earned image. Apply −0.6 for figurative muddle and −0.3 for the expository close, total −0.9 within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—guiding a ship by scent-memory rather than light—offers a fresh inflection on lighthouse rescue narratives, and the jasmine cork is a specific, non-obvious anchor. However, the "vibrations of intent" framing and the captain's sudden recognition of his wife's garden (twenty years and a thousand miles distant) lean on convenient mysticism rather than grounded transformation of the trope. The emotional truth of memory as guide is present, but the mechanics feel more magical than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris drives the inciting decision (to beckon rather than warn), the middle beat (placing the cork, summoning the scent), and is present at closure when he picks up the cork and descends. His choices create all key turns and the final image confirms his proof. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cork appears in beat one (drawn from pocket, described), beat two (placed on console, held warm in palm), and beat three (picked up after the rescue, still in hand at closure). It functions as the tactile key to Aris's method and charges the final image. The object is irreplaceable (her cork, her garden scent) and its use constrains the method. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept ("vibrations of intent") is named early and shapes Aris's tactic: he does not shout or signal with light, but beckons by summoning a scent-memory. The hum in the lens and the scent reaching the captain demonstrate the concept in action. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"purified intention" and "vibration" read more as thematic labels than as costs or constraints that narrow Aris's options. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is mentioned once as a core concept Aris learned, then demonstrated when he uses the cork to focus his memory and produce the scent. The trait enables the beckoning action but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice—Aris's method works without friction. Label-only in setup, functional in middle beat, but no tradeoff or price on the page. Cap at mid-5s for enabling without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "beckon" is signaled early ("His action was to beckon, not to warn"), executed in the middle beat (Aris fills his mind with the scent, the lens hums, the glow pulses), and confirmed at closure when the Keeper acknowledges "Just a whisper." The major turn—safe passage—traces directly to this action, and it redefines the lighthouse's role. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "by the scent of a garden at night" is seeded early (the cork's jasmine and damp earth), executed in the middle beat (Aris summons the exact fragrance), and delivers the result (the captain smells it and turns the wheel). The mechanics matter: scent versus light or sound, memory versus command. Early signal, shapes the attempt, delivers the outcome. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors every beat: Aris climbs the tower at pre-dawn, the cobalt glow awakens in the lens, dawn bleeds cobalt into the walls, and sunrise gilds the final image. The tower's height and the lamp room's position enable the broadcast; the dawn timing (post-heat-wave, fog rolling in) supplies the constraint (no piercing beam will penetrate). Early signal, micro-setting (lamp room, console), tactical constraint, and closure charge all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the heat wave breaks" is named in the opening line and supplies atmospheric texture (gasping world, fog remnant). However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—the story would function identically if set on any foggy dawn. The timing is present in setup and closure (sunrise ends the glow) but does not narrow options or impose a clock. Functional but replaceable; lyric reprise without cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated early ("quiet, stubborn stone in his gut"), dramatized in the middle beat (Aris's beckoning versus the Keeper's prior shouts), and validated at closure when the Keeper concedes "Just a whisper" and the proof is "written in safe passage." The motivation drives every choice and the final image confirms it. Early signal, shapes all beats, closure linkage, visible cost (exhaustion, foreclosed path).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone "screaming tenderness" is named once in the opening ("moved with a screaming tenderness") and echoed in the gentle beckoning versus frantic prior signals. The paradox (screaming/gentle) charges the method but is not sustained as a consistent tonal signature—most of the piece reads as lyric solemnity without the contradictory intensity the phrase promises. Present at setup, shapes the method, but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image beyond quiet completion.</comment>
