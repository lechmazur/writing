<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to escape is clear and her choice to override panic and use the vial is embodied through breath control and deliberate movement. However, interiority leans on stock phrasing ("every instinct screamed," "hot and instinctual wave") and the emotional progression from panic to calm to triumph feels smoothed rather than contradictory. The final choice to trust the hush is earned by prior setup, but the internal conflict resolves too neatly without visible ambivalence at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The story delivers one meaningful tightening—Aris must recall the exact sequence under oxygen pressure—and closure (escape through the revealed passage) occurs on the page with visible cost (vial spent, air dwindling). The final glyph twist (clockwise turn vs. push) provides a micro-reversal that narrows options and charges the escape, satisfying causal escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered with towering pillars, worn glyphs, and oppressive depth. Spatial choreography remains clear: Aris moves from collapse site to dais to wall passage to cliffside exit. The oxygen gauge and cold vial constrain her choices concretely. The emerging pinprick of light and starry sky charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting elements shape tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape from the collapsed temple) is signaled immediately and sustained. Time pressure (oxygen warning, dwindling air) and the hush's ephemeral nature tighten options meaningfully. The glyph-sequence puzzle delivers one on-page reversal (initial failure, then correction) driven by Aris's agency. Cost is legible: the vial is spent and cannot be reused. Under the causal lens, escalation is clean and the final move forecloses other paths with felt urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (mastering ephemeral silence to override instinct and survive) emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The vial's emptiness and the "permanent silence in her soul" offer a non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward articulation ("a lesson in overriding instinct, in trusting the subtle over the savage") that slightly undercuts earned resonance. The gathered hush motif shapes the climax but risks symbolic convenience since it appears mid-story without earlier grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aris; perceptual signature (dive light cutting gloom, cold crystal, velvet quiet) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction stays within her technical-diver lexicon. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under oxygen stress. Minor register drift: "lonesome splendor" and "majestic tomb offering a fleeting gift" elevate slightly beyond her immediate crisis state, but remain legible and do not break focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in the escape sequence. However, stock metaphors recur: "frantic bubble," "velvet quiet," "hot and instinutual wave," and "lonesome splendor" appears three times without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence in the opening ("Her oxygen gauge blinked... She was the distress signal sender... Trapped by...") and paraphrase loops ("the gathered hush," "the hush") add minor drag. Line-level clarity remains intact at closure, so penalties stay moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise—using distilled silence to unlock memories and solve an ancient mechanism—offers a fresh synthesis. Execution is competent but safe: the underwater escape, ticking-clock oxygen, and magical vial follow familiar beats. The twist (clockwise turn) and the cost (spent vial, permanent psychic change) add specificity. The story does not transform its template structure beyond the concept's novelty, and "lonesome splendor" as both tone and refrain feels more decorative than integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris (distress signal sender) drives every key turn: she chooses to unseal the vial, fights panic to recall the sequence, corrects the glyph action, and escapes. Her decisions alter tactics and outcome across three beats (unsealing, replication, correction) and shape the closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears early (nestled against chest), is handled at the key beat (unsealed, hush released), and returns empty at closure as a relic that charges the final image. It enables the memory-touch mechanic and its spent state forecloses reuse, satisfying irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gathered hush (substance distilled from silence) shapes stakes and tactics: releasing it calms Aris, reveals memories, and allows the glyph sequence to be learned. It appears by name in the first third, drives the central beat, and its dissipation adds time pressure. Cost (vial emptied, hush spent) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is the hush's primary function, enabling the vision of priests and glyph sequence. It constrains action (Aris must release the hush to see the code) and costs her the substance permanently. The trait is causal in one major beat and mentioned at closure (the hush "had touched her"), satisfying development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" (the locking mechanism) is the explicit goal and drives the glyph-sequence puzzle. Aris replicates touches, fails, then corrects to unsnarl the seal, opening the passage. The action is irreplaceable in plot logic but slightly generic (solve puzzle = unlock exit). It shapes two beats (initial attempt, correction) and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled early ("every instinct screamed") and dramatized twice: Aris fights the urge to thrash when unsealing the vial, then overrides doubt when the glyphs initially fail. The method shapes her choices under pressure and is named at closure ("a lesson in overriding instinct"), tying mechanics to theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple supplies the collapsed entrance (trap), the glyphs and dais (puzzle resources), the hidden passage (escape route), and the cliffside crevice (exit). It pressures every choice through depth, darkness, and oxygen limits. The setting is indispensable; swapping to another locale would break plot logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is tracked concretely: oxygen gauge blinks a warning, "time was running short," air is "dwindling," and "time ran short with every beat of her heart." The clock tightens Aris's decision to override panic and forces her correction under stress. It shapes tactics across three beats and charges the final escape urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated as her motivation and drives the vial-use decision. However, it remains somewhat abstract; the on-page want is survival/escape, with harnessing the ephemeral as the chosen method. Friction between the ephemeral nature (hush dissipating) and the need for permanence (code recall) adds cost, but the motivation could be more dramatized as conflicted desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named three times (opening, mid-story, final paragraph) and attempts to unify isolation and beauty. Tone modulates from oppressive gloom to quiet calm to relief, supporting pressure shifts. However, the phrase feels applied rather than woven through sensory texture; it charges the final image only weakly because the descriptor is repeated without evolving meaning.</comment>
