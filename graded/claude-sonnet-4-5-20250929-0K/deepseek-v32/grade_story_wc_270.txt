<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and consistent—to evolve tradition through choice rather than obedience—and her plant-telepathy trait shapes her method concretely. Her final stance (returning with a revelation, not a relic) is earned by the unsealing experience. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical language ("insurgent's resolve hardening into a creator's calm") rather than embodied contradiction, and her emotional arc proceeds smoothly without genuine internal conflict or cost that complicates her convictions. The choice to unseal feels inevitable from the start, with no on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with situational shading: Marta's decoding → unsealing → revelation sequence links clearly, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the "question" reframes Implanted Destiny from decree to catalyst, foreclosing blind obedience with conceptual cost). Orientation anchors (Marta, hot springs, reconstruction era) arrive early. The escalation is a single meaningful tightening: the unsealing transforms the embryo from fixed fate into imperative for choice. Cost is conceptual and felt in her new responsibility, though the physical stakes remain abstract (no immediate trade-off or forfeited path on the page). One minor causality slip: the kite's discovery and months of decoding are summarized without on-page struggle, softening the turn's earned weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs function as both instrument and constraint: mineral-rich water is essential to the unsealing, and the geothermal environment anchors Marta's plant-telepathy. Sensory detail (steamy edge, bubbling hottest part, gurgle of earth) integrates into action and reflects Marta's priorities. The petrified tree and kite tail provide micro-setting that charges the method. Spatial choreography is clear (rock, pool edge, submerged amber). The springs' "living, changing core" charges the final image and mirrors theme. This setting choice materially shapes the climactic action and resonates at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to unseal the amber now or accept elder decree—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The unsealing itself is a decisive action that forecloses blind tradition, and the revelation (ancestors posed a question, not a command) reweights the reconstruction's path. However, escalation is thin: no reversals or tactical adjustments occur; Marta faces no on-page opposition or cost that alters her approach mid-scene. The choice to hum the decoded tones proceeds without friction, and the "nothing happened / then eruption" beat is a mechanical reveal rather than a pressure-tested turn. Agency is present but uncomplicated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—tradition as chosen evolution versus inherited cage—emerges organically from the unsealing and the embryo's dissolution into a question. The final image (kite tail as "memory of the lock, not the key," Marta walking away to "plant a new kind of seed") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the amber's melting and the plants' collective question. One slip: the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Tradition would not be a cage…but a garden tended with intent") that risks spelling out what the action has already shown. Still, the ending's resonance—destiny as chosen, not implanted—lands with conceptual clarity and avoids reductive binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Marta's perceptual signature (plant-telepathy as "sensations" and "patterns") is distinct. Diction elevates intentionally ("heresy," "insurgent's resolve," "imperative to choose one wisely") to match Marta's philosophical stance. However, several passages drift into elevated abstract register that sits uneasily with embodied urgency: "relentless question," "fragile reconstruction," "immense weight and lightness of true destiny: chosen." The syntax in high-pressure beats (unsealing, revelation) remains declarative and calm, missing rhythmic acceleration. Filter verbs ("She placed," "She felt") are present but not excessive. Voice is coherent but lacks the compression or idiosyncratic texture that would raise it into high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is strong, and information density is high in the method beats (kite script, telepathic translation, sonic key). Sentence openings vary adequately. Two distinct line-level issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loops in the reflection-heavy middle ("They conveyed patterns…rhythms that mirrored" / "This was the method…using the plants as living translators") restate the same content across adjacent lines. (2) Stock metaphor and elevated abstraction cluster in the final third: "insurgent's resolve hardening into a creator's calm," "immense weight and lightness of true destiny: chosen," "walked away…ready to plant a new kind of seed" all lean on familiar phrasing without fresh embodiment. The closure beat itself ("What will you grow?") is vivid, but surrounding lines dull its charge with rehearsed diction. Apply −0.8 for loops and metaphor stock in Q7; artifacts touch closure vicinity, so disallow 9+ globally per artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of plant-telepathy, cryptic kite script, and volcanic-spring unsealing is specific and non-obvious, and the reframing of "Implanted Destiny" from fixed fate to catalyst for choice offers a fresh angle on prophecy/ancestor tropes. However, the emotional and thematic arc—elder prohibition vs. individual defiance, symbolic object unsealing, revelation that empowers choice—follows a familiar template without lived-detail transformation. The kite's months-long decoding is summarized rather than dramatized, and no unexpected complication forces Marta to reconsider or adapt. The reconstruction setting remains backdrop rather than pressure. Proximity check: "The time was now…or never" and "walked away…ready to plant a new kind of seed" echo stock phrasing. Within-band placement reflects competent synthesis without the bold risk or irreplaceable particulars that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta (insurgent grandmother) is present from the opening, drives the unsealing action at midpoint, and the final beat hinges on her choice to return with revelation rather than relic. Her trait (accidentally telepathic with plants) enables the decoding method and charges the collective-voice revelation. She makes two key on-page decisions: to decode using plant-telepathy and to unseal immediately. Her motivation (evolve tradition with intent) shapes every beat and the closure reframes it as chosen destiny. The character is essential to plot logic and closure; removing her would collapse causality. Cost is conceptual (responsibility to plant a new seed) rather than relational or physical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber embryo is handled across three beats: Marta cradles it at the opening (establishing it as forbidden seed), she decodes the unsealing method in the middle, and she submerges and hums the tones to dissolve it at climax. Its dissolution triggers the plant-voice revelation ("What will you grow?") and reweights "Implanted Destiny" from decree to question. The object's transformation (amber melting, embryo dissipating into mineral broth) is on-page and charges the final image. Removing the amber would break the plot's logic and thematic hinge. Slight deduction: the embryo's early description leans ornamental ("delicate, unrecognizable") before its function emerges; still, it drives closure decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Implanted Destiny" is named early, frames the elders' prohibition, and is revealed at closure to be a question rather than a blueprint—this reframing reweights the entire reconstruction stake and Marta's motivation. The concept shapes Marta's decision to unseal now and charges the final image (destiny as chosen). It constrains the middle action (decoding is necessary because the elders forbid premature unsealing) and pays off when the embryo's dissolution voices the ancestors' true imperative. The concept is integral to causality and theme, though its mechanics (why ancestors embedded a question in amber) remain abstract. No visible cost is tied specifically to the concept's existence; the cost belongs to Marta's choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plant-telepathy is signaled early ("freak childhood accident…accidentally telepathic") and enables the pivotal decoding: Marta uses moss, ferns, and geothermal algae as living translators to convert the kite script into sonic frequencies. This trait constrains her method (she must connect via bare feet in soil) and enables the unsealing action. It reappears at closure when the plant chorus conveys the ancestors' question, charging the revelation. The trait is specific, irreplaceable, and present in three beats (guiding to the pool, decoding, revelation). One friction: the accident origin is mentioned but not developed, and no on-page cost or trade-off (e.g., sensory overload, social isolation) complicates its use in the high-pressure unsealing beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The unsealing action (submerging amber, humming decoded tones, dissolution) is the story's climactic turn and directly produces the revelation that reframes Implanted Destiny. It is set up by the decoding work, constrained by the hot spring's properties, and delivers the conceptual payoff: the embryo's question replaces elder decree. Removing the unsealing would eliminate the plot's decisive change and thematic closure. The action is present across the final third (preparation, execution, aftermath) and its mechanics (sonic key, geothermal dissolution) are specific and non-swappable. Minor friction: the unsealing proceeds without complication or cost in the moment—Marta hums, the amber dissolves, the question arrives—so the action's causal weight rests entirely on prior decoding rather than pressure during execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cryptic script on the kite tail is introduced early (abandoned kite caught months before, "consumed her days"), frames the decoding challenge, and its solution (sonic frequencies decoded via plant-telepathy) directly enables the unsealing. The method is specific: kite script → plant translation → geothermal resonance. Removing the kite would collapse the plot's middle logic. Two frictions lower the score: (1) the kite's discovery and months of decoding are summarized rather than dramatized, so the method's difficulty and Marta's struggle remain abstract; (2) the script's origin (synthetic tail, organic shapes, who made it) is unexplained, weakening its felt necessity. Still, it shapes two beats (decoding, unsealing) and charges the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are essential: their mineral-rich, geothermal water is the instrument that dissolves the amber when paired with Marta's hummed tones. The setting supplies a resource (bubbling heat) that Marta cannot replicate elsewhere, and the spring's "gurgle" merges with her voice to create the unsealing resonance. The location is signaled early, revisited at the climactic action, and its "living, changing core" charges the final image as metaphor for deliberate evolution. Spatial detail (steamy edge, warm rock, hottest part of pool) integrates into choreography. The springs constrain Marta's method and are irreplaceable to plot logic. Minor friction: the reconstruction valley setting (timeframe element) and the springs feel spatially separate; the springs' role in the broader reconstruction is unaddressed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" is named in the opening line and frames Marta's urgency ("the time was now…or never"), suggesting the reconstruction window is finite and tradition-choices must be made while the valley is still malleable. The timeframe motivates Marta's decision to act immediately rather than wait. However, it does not constrain tactics on the page—no countdown, competing deadline, or reconstruction-specific pressure alters Marta's method. The reconstruction councils are named as a future destination but do not appear. The timeframe functions as thematic context (old-world collapse, fragile rebuild) rather than a live clock that shapes beats. It touches closure obliquely (Marta will return to councils) but does not tighten the unsealing action itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marta's motivation—to evolve tradition with intent rather than blind obedience—is stated early, dramatized in her decision to defy elder prohibition, and reframed at closure when the revelation shows ancestors also intended chosen evolution. The motivation drives her unsealing choice and charges the final image (returning not with relic but revelation, tradition as "garden tended with intent"). It is present across setup, middle defiance, and closure stance. Minor friction: the motivation is articulated more often than tested—no on-page moment where Marta doubts her course or weighs competing values (e.g., respect for elders vs. urgency). The friction between wants and costs is conceptual rather than embodied in a difficult choice during the unsealing.</comment>
