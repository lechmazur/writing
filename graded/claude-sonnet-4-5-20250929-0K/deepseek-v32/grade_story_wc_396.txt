<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("map empathy onto action") is stated clearly but her interiority leans on abstract labels—"calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice (raising the fragment, projecting visions, directing the search) feels more like a sequence of outcomes than a decision forged from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The cost of her action is implied (the fragment becomes "permanently warm," shadows now "earned wisdom") but remains figurative rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows her options. Micro-choices exist (tracing the shard, standing before mirrors, closing her eyes) but they serve the plot more than they reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values with on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and signals a dominant stake (restoring the Orb to resolve discord). The middle "weeks of visits" is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening causal linkage; the final mirror vision appears as discovery rather than a because/therefore turn driven by Elara's prior choices. The closure—projecting visions and directing the collective mission—lands on the page, but the cost reads as conceptual ("shared histories" dissolve tension) without a visible price that forecloses a live option for Elara herself. Under a Causal lens, the escalation lacks motivated ellipsis; under Accumulative/Textural, the pattern of mirror glimpses is told more than shown, and the cadence shift at the end is modest. The inferred lens (hybrid leaning Accumulative) is legible but not tightly held through the middle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are vivid and consistently anchored, and the vintage store "Relics & Reflections" is named and used across beats. The fragment (held, traced, raised) functions as a micro-object that charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice under pressure—Elara walks freely between orchard, cliff, and town without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective (grinding ice, speckled mirrors, twilight silver) but rarely filtered through urgency or POV bias; the setting remains more atmospheric than tactical. The final scene's spatial choreography (representatives below, Elara at the cliff's edge) is clear but static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (peace between orchard and ice realms) is signaled early and remains coherent. The middle tightening—weeks of mirror visits culminating in the pivotal vision—is summarized rather than shown as a live reversal that narrows options. The final action (projecting visions, directing the search) is a resolution, but the escalation leading to it lacks a visible turn where Elara's agency forecloses a path with cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but the fragment's glow and the crowd's immediate acceptance feel convenient. Agency is present (she chooses to raise the fragment, to speak) but the pressure does not visibly deepen through a prior mistake or sacrifice that compounds before this moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as reconstitution of shared pain) emerges from the mirror visions and the final projection, and the closing image reweights the fragment's meaning without stating a moral. However, key phrases—"courageous anomaly," "map empathy onto action," "reconstitution is always of the heart, first"—lean on prompt labels and near-platitudes rather than letting the particulars (the lost child, the ice and orchard histories) carry the weight. The final paragraph's direct thematic summary ("testament to the peace forged…by the courageous anomaly") functions as a moral rather than an earned resonance. Subtext in gesture and image is modest; most meaning is declared. The thematic echo in the closing lines is overt, triggering a deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara) with stable third-person limited distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("shadow-laced," sensing tensions "as one might feel a coming storm") but leans on stock constructions. Diction is consistent and controlled, though phrases like "weighted breath before reply" and "collective mission" drift toward elevated register. The prose has texture (gnarled trees, speckled mirrors, tarnished frame) and the narrative stance is calm and purposeful, matching Elara's attribute. However, under peak stress (final confrontation) the syntax remains measured rather than compressing or fragmenting, and the interiority stays abstract ("concentration," "profound calm intuition") rather than embodying thought degradation or contradictory sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high and grammar clean, but information density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing. "Shadow-laced" appears three times with minimal variation; "weighted breath before reply" bookends without evolving. The middle summary ("After weeks of visits…") compresses multiple beats into a single sentence, reducing propulsion. Figurative language is frequent but generic: "tapestry of sorrows," "weave of earned wisdom," "testament to peace." Sentence openings vary, but rhythm remains uniform across tonal shifts (crisis and resolution sound equally measured). The final paragraph's recapitulation ("The orchard's apples sweetened…enduring peace") functions as a summary rather than a final image with charge, and several lines restate the same conceptual point without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—restore a magical Orb via vintage mirrors to resolve geopolitical discord—is a template quest structure (broken artifact → cryptic method → restoration). The specifics (shadow-laced peacekeeper, lighthouse orchard, ice floes) are vivid but do not transform the familiar arc; the emotional truth (shared childhood fear as the root of conflict) is legible but arrives as a neat answer rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The "courageous anomaly" framing and "map empathy onto action" idiom read as prompt labels rather than organic voice. The mirrors' function (show past pain) is generic scrying; the fragment's glow at the end is a stock climax. Transformation test: the plot and arc work unchanged with different names and a different broken object. No close proximity to famous lines, but the piece does not take bold risks or offer a fresh moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (shadow-laced peacekeeper) is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: visiting the mirrors, interpreting the final vision, raising the fragment, directing the search. She appears in the setup (walking the orchard), shapes the middle (mirror visits), and acts in the closure (projects visions, speaks). However, her "shadow-laced" trait remains ornamental description rather than a constraint on her tactics, and the peacekeeper role is more label than a friction that forces trade-offs. The final action (raising the fragment) is causal but the element itself could be replaced with "visionary diplomat" or "empathic mediator" without structural loss. Two beats + closure participation push the score above mid-band, but swappability and lack of visible cost cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment is handled in multiple beats: Elara traces it in her pocket (opening), holds it before mirrors (middle summary), and raises it to project visions (closure). It seeds early and returns with reweighted meaning (from inert shard to glowing projector). However, the fragment's specific properties (cloudy, broken, warm) do not constrain her choices—its function is symbolic rather than tactical. The glow at the end resolves a problem (discord) without the fragment having created friction earlier. Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure) and a meaningful reprise earn mid-6s, but the lack of causal cost and the summary treatment of middle beats prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" appears as a label in the exposition and recurs in the final paragraph ("testament to…the courageous anomaly of a keeper"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices. The concept is thematic rather than mechanical: Elara's courage is told, not tested by a difficult trade-off. The anomaly aspect (believing harmony requires understanding fears, not enforcing silence) is stated but not dramatized through a live conflict where her approach risks failure or costs her standing. Present in setup and closure but ornamental, earning low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is stated early ("she felt the rising tensions…without panic but with absolute certainty") and recurs in the closure scene ("profound, calm intuition"). The trait enables her to interpret the mirror visions and guides her final concentration, giving it functional presence. However, it does not constrain or impose a visible cost—Elara's calm is always sufficient, never a liability that she must work around. The attribute is label-heavy and could be swapped for "insightfully patient" or "serenely perceptive" with minor edits. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) and one beat involvement (final concentration) place it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the central action: the Orb must be reconstituted, and the method is cryptic ("reconstitute via glimpses in vintage store mirrors"). The action drives the middle sequence (mirror visits) and the closure turn (Elara realizes reconstitution is "not about the object, but about the vision it represented"). However, the reconstitution itself is metaphorical—the fragment never physically repairs, it glows and projects—so the action's mechanics are vague. Present in setup, middle summary, and closure, but the swappability (could be "restore," "reforge," "heal") and the summary treatment of middle beats prevent higher scores. Three-gate presence and closure linkage earn mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method ("via glimpses in vintage store mirrors") is signaled early and used in the middle: Elara visits the shop "Relics & Reflections," stands before different mirrors, and the final cheval glass shows the pivotal vision. The method is specific and the mirrors supply the insight that drives the closure. However, the mechanics are told in summary ("After weeks of visits…") rather than shown in distinct beats, and the mirrors function passively (they show, she absorbs) without constraining her attempts or imposing a cost. Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure) but summary treatment and passive role cap it at the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above ice floes is vividly established in the opening and recurs at the closure scene (cliff's edge, representatives below, lighthouse beam sweeps). The setting is atmospheric and consistent but does not pressure Elara's choices—she moves freely between orchard, town, and cliff without spatial friction or resource constraint. The ice floes grind as a sign of discord, but this is external mood rather than a tactical pressure on her actions. Three-gate presence (setup, middle locale, closure) earns functional credit, but the setting remains postcard description rather than a constraint that alters tactics, capping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the weighted breath before reply" is named in the opening as the moment of the crisis ("representatives…awaited her reply") and recurs in the closure ("During the weighted breath before reply, she closed her eyes"). The timeframe is poetic and frames the final beat, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—weeks pass in the middle with no time pressure, and the "weighted breath" is more a metaphorical marker than a constraint that forces Elara to act faster or differently. Present in setup and closure but ornamental, earning low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is Elara's stated motivation ("Her motivation, always, was to map empathy onto action") and drives the plot: she absorbs mirror visions (empathy) and translates them into the collective search mission (action). The motivation is present in setup, middle, and closure, and the final turn explicitly enacts it. However, the phrasing is abstract and label-like, and the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost—Elara's empathy is never tested against a personal stake or a competing duty. Three-gate presence and closure linkage earn mid-5s, but the lack of friction and the told-only treatment prevent higher scores.</comment>
