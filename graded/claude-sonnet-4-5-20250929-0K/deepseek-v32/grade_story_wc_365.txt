<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (to discover the withheld truth) is signaled early and drives her actions through the repair bay exploration. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract states ("weaving," "sensory map maker") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The mentor revelation arrives cleanly but her emotional response remains curiously muted—"weight" is declared rather than felt through physical consequence or forced renunciation. The final choice to "complete Alistair's work" feels like acceptance of a thesis rather than a decision forged from competing goods with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory impressions and parallel-world glimpses toward a final revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the third paragraph, avoiding penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the burden and stabilizes the nexus), but the cost remains abstract—"weight she could shoulder" is asserted rather than demonstrated through forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The shard's function as memory crystal and her use of it to "complete" the work lands on the page, yet the before/after change in her stance or circumstances is more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored early with "derelict hall," "decaying starship skeletons," and "rusted console," creating a vivid thin-place atmosphere. The green glass shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her weaving attempts (she grips it to stabilize, uses its resonance to redirect energy). Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone scent, engine hum—and filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception. The setting charges the final image: "among the ruins" she finishes adjustments, and the nexus becomes integral to her new cartography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discover the withheld truth and understand the mentor's vanishing. Pressure accumulates through the violent psychic current and cascade of realities, yet Elara's agency in these moments feels reactive—she grips the shard, redirects flow—without a clear trade-off or foreclosed path. The revelation about Alistair's sacrifice is received rather than earned through her choice under fire. The final decision to stabilize the nexus is stated with resolve but lacks a visible price: no on-page renunciation of alternate paths or immediate consequence that alters her tactical options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the weight of withheld truth, the burden of legacy, the power to choose despite sorrow. The shard and repair bay function as concrete anchors rather than heavy symbols. The final image—"she listened, ready to weave anew"—offers quiet resonance without overt moralizing. However, several lines edge toward thematic echo: "knowledge brought sorrow but also the power to choose" and "It was the mass of consequence, the density of love, and the gravity of continuity" articulate the thesis directly in near-prompt language, reducing subtext in the closing third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic mapping, sensory focus—but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("mental embroidery," "narrative of her life") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Purposeful compression in the parallel-universe sequences is legible and taught early, so elision is waived. No head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct lyric texture, yet under peak pressure (the violent psychic current) the diction stays uniform rather than fragmenting or tightening, missing an opportunity for rhythmic modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Her motivation was constant" / "Elara's motivation"; "cyclically spontaneous, flaring without warning yet following a hidden rhythm" / "The cyclically spontaneous surge" recycles the phrase without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "She saw… He was… He had…" across adjacent lines. Stock metaphor: "thin place between realities." The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third, warranting −0.6 for paraphrase/template runs and −0.1 for stock phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—sensory map maker weaving between parallel worlds to solve a mentor's mystery—combines familiar genre elements (multiverse exploration, mystical artifact, disappeared teacher) without a fresh synthesis. The cyclically spontaneous ability and green glass shard function logically but feel like prompt-fulfillment rather than inevitable story choices. The emotional arc (student discovers mentor's noble sacrifice and accepts his mantle) follows a well-worn template. Specificity in the spaceport setting and synesthetic details add texture, yet the transformation test suggests the plot would survive intact with different cosmetic labels, signaling insufficient originality for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara as "sensory map maker" is introduced in paragraph two and frames her perception throughout. She makes key choices: placing the shard on the console, beginning the weaving, gripping the shard to stabilize, delving deeper through worlds, and deciding to complete Alistair's work. However, most of these choices are serial observations or reactive stabilizations rather than decisions that narrow options with visible cost. The final choice to "use the shard to stabilize this nexus" is stated but not dramatized as a fork with competing paths. Present across setup, middle, and ending; shapes two beats (stabilization, final adjustment); but causally thin and somewhat swappable with "psychic investigator" or similar role. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability −0.6, ornamental trait label −0.3, reactive rather than decisive −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in paragraph ten ("cool and sharp in her palm"), is placed on the console (paragraph fifteen), gripped to stabilize the psychic current (paragraph twenty-one), flares and projects images (paragraph twenty-three), recognized as a memory crystal (paragraph thirty-four), and becomes "integral to her cartography" in the closing adjustment. Handled across at least four distinct beats with evolving function: key → stabilizer → projector → memory vessel → tool for nexus repair. Early signal +0.5, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables stabilization and vision) +1.0, closure linkage (integral to final action) +1.2, specificity (memory crystal from the rift) +0.6, cost connection (she must use it to shoulder the burden) +0.4. No major frictions. Total pushes toward high-7s: 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, but the shard's role in the final adjustment is asserted more than dramatized with unique mechanical cost, capping at 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is introduced as her "unique talent" (paragraph seven) and described as "delicate mental embroidery." She performs the weaving in paragraph seventeen, extending her senses into the multiverse, and again in paragraph thirty-five ("wove between worlds with precision"). The concept shapes her method and appears in the climax, but the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page constraint where weaving forces a trade-off or alters her tactical options in a visible way. It frames the stakes (navigating parallel universes to find truth) yet does not create friction or narrow her choices; she can weave whenever the power surges. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure participation (she weaves to stabilize) +0.9, but ornamental mechanics (no cost or constraint shown) −0.6, swappable with "astral projection" −0.5, label-only in key moments −0.3 = 3.0 + 3.0 – 1.4 = ~4.6, lifted slightly by lyric reprise in final paragraph to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is introduced in paragraph eight as a trait of her ability: "flaring without warning yet following a hidden rhythm." It appears again in paragraphs nineteen, thirty-three, and thirty-six. The trait is present across setup and ending, but it never constrains a choice—Elara does not struggle with mistimed surges or sacrifice an opportunity because the cycle is off. The surges enable her portal access and final harmonization, yet no visible trade-off or cost is tied to the cyclical nature itself. Early signal +0.4, three mentions (same functional beat) count as ~1.5 touches +0.6, closure mention +0.3, but label-only (no dramatized constraint) −0.6, swappable with "unpredictable" −0.5 = 3.0 + 1.3 – 1.1 = ~3.2, rounded to 4.7 for rhythm-mention in final paragraph that charges slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears in paragraph twenty-two when Elara uses the shard's resonance to redirect erratic psychic flow toward a calmer frequency, stabilizing her. Later, paragraph thirty-one states she needed to "redirect… the very narrative of her life," and paragraph thirty-four describes redirecting latent dimensional energies to prevent breaches. The action is central to the climax and to closure. Early presence (before midpoint) +0.5, two distinct beats (psychic current, dimensional energies) +0.9, causal pressure (enables survival and nexus repair) +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, but the mechanics are told more than shown (we don't see the redirect's cost or specificity on the page) −0.6, slightly swappable with "channel" or "stabilize" −0.4 = 3.0 + 3.4 – 1.0 = ~5.4, lifted to 6.3 by its role in the final adjustment paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is the method: paragraph nine introduces her navigation "through parallel universes, threading her consciousness through their subtle variances." She maps scent and sound across worlds (paragraph eighteen), witnesses variations of Alistair's sacrifice (paragraphs twenty-nine–thirty), and in paragraph thirty-five "wove between worlds with precision." The method is signaled early and recurs across setup, middle, and ending. However, the multiverse mechanics do not materially constrain her—she accesses whichever world the narrative needs without cost or failure. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure participation +0.7, but ornamental use (no failed attempt or tradeoff for choosing one world over another) −0.7, swappable with "dimensions" or "realities" −0.4 = 3.0 + 2.7 – 1.1 = ~4.6, lifted slightly by final-paragraph reprise to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "abandoned spaceport repair bay" is introduced in paragraph one and anchored with "derelict hall," "decaying starship skeletons," and "rusted console" (paragraphs four, thirteen, fifteen). It functions as a "thin place between realities" (paragraph thirteen), enabling her weaving. She anchors her body there while her mind explores (paragraph fourteen), and the final adjustment occurs "in the silence of the repair bay" (paragraph thirty-nine). The setting provides both atmosphere and a functional constraint (thin-place nexus). Early signal +0.7, two beats (anchor point, final adjustment site) +0.9, causal pressure (enables weaving) +0.8, closure linkage (site of final action) +1.0, specificity (spaceport ruins, not generic liminal space) +0.5, but the "thin place" mechanic is asserted rather than demonstrated through failed attempts elsewhere −0.4 = 3.0 + 3.9 – 0.4 = ~6.5, rounded up to 6.8 for strong atmospheric charge in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears in the opening line and is reprised in paragraph thirty-two ("murmur of half-remembered dreams coalesced into unwavering resolve"). The timeframe is lyric and atmospheric rather than a concrete constraint. No clock or urgency tied to "half-remembered dreams" pressures Elara's choices; the phrase functions as tone-setting metaphor. Lyric seed-to-reprise structure +0.8, closure participation (reprise in resolve moment) +0.5, but ornamental (does not tighten decisions or tactics) −0.8, swappable with "liminal dusk" or similar −0.5, label-only −0.3 = 3.0 + 1.3 – 1.6 = ~2.7, adjusted down to 2.4 for lack of any time-pressure mechanic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated in paragraph five and drives the entire plot. She senses the shard as a key (paragraph twelve), seeks understanding through weaving (paragraph seventeen), receives the revelation about Alistair (paragraphs twenty-six–twenty-seven), and the "withheld truth" recurs in paragraphs thirty-one, thirty-six, forty, and forty-one. The motivation is present across all three gates and directly shapes the ending choice. Early signal +0.7, four beats (sensing key, revelation, acceptance, final adjustment) +1.4, causal pressure (her search enables all major turns) +1.2, closure linkage (she shoulders the truth's weight) +1.3, cost connection (carrying responsibility and legacy) +0.5, but the friction between desire and cost is told more than shown in embodied choice −0.5, slight abstraction ("weight" as metaphor rather than dramatized trade-off) −0.3 = 3.0 + 5.1 – 0.8 = ~7.3, adjusted to 7.2 for the final paragraph's thematic summary diluting the motivational stakes slightly.</comment>
