<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris is given clear motivation (mapping healing) and his choice to sit with Elara is dramatized, but his internal contradiction—endless travel versus loneliness—remains asserted rather than embodied in a micro-choice under pressure. Elara's embodied emotion (breath as ghost, frail form) and her question "Do you think it will be enough?" feel authentic and character-particular. The final renunciation (accepting his stranded state, carrying the thread) forecloses a path, but the cost reads more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("geography of healing") in multiple paragraphs nudges the score down slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (cliff, port, garden) land by ~80 words; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the interview, the thread motif deepens, and the final starlit image reweights Aris's search with cost (stranded, alone, but holding the weft). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden becomes monument, the thread persistent reality, and his loneliness gains texture. Cost is legible in "the last ship was gone, the garden was shadowed, but the weft held." One meaningful deepening via Elara's death tightens his understanding. Minor: the "method" (projecting presence) is asserted late rather than dramatized progressively, creating a small conceptual leap at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The garden is vividly rendered (rust, gold, crimson maple, frosted hedges, woodsmoke, fallen apples) and filtered through Aris's witnessing lens. Spatial choreography (cliff → inland bluffs → garden center bench) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the final image (bare branches, stars, monument quality) and reflects Elara's story of sanctuary. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or alter tactics during the central interview; it functions more as atmospheric crucible than active pressure, capping the score below 8.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Aris seeks to capture Elara's life before it vanishes; secondary: her need for witness. The interview deepens understanding (one meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens), and Elara's death is the on-page cost that transforms the garden into monument. Agency is present (Aris's choice to return alone, to sit and complete the record), but the escalation is contemplative rather than a forced trade-off with visible friction. The final image reweights his loneliness, but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally pressing at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (connection, memory, healing shaped around absence) emerges through the thread motif and the garden's design from a lost homeland. The final image—"the weft held"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence ("a silence that was not empty") and in the thread as undercurrent. Minor: "geography of healing" and "by projecting presence" edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than remaining fully grounded in scene particulars, and the ending risks quiet profundity that borders on the sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Aris's perceptual signature (witness, obituarist, mapper of healing) is consistent. Elara's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Do you think it will be enough?"). However, elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "oblique light," "poignant rot") recurs in nearly every paragraph, and at peak emotional beats (Elara's death, final reflection) the prose remains uniformly lyric rather than tightening or degrading under stress. Register is consistent but slightly formal for the focalizer's present-tense emotion, nudging the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, multiple template stems recur: "He/She [verb]" and "The garden was…" across adjacent sentences. Figurative language is dense (rust/gold/embers, tapestry of decay, geography of healing) but often stacked without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, creating mild overwriting. Paraphrase loop: "It is not an ending… It is a landmark" followed immediately by elaboration that restates the same idea. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum at non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (obituaries for the living, stranded traveler, garden as memory-carpet) offers a fresh synthesis, and the thread motif is specific and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc—witness to dying woman, acceptance of solitary purpose—follows a familiar template without radical transformation. The "geography of healing" phrasing and the final starlit monument image feel poeticized rather than inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and lyric tone, but closure hinges more on mood than on a surprising causal or conceptual turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris is signaled in the opening and his role (obituary writer) frames expectation. He makes two key choices: to sit with Elara and to return alone to complete the record. These choices shape the middle and ending beats, but they are observational and reflective rather than high-cost tactical decisions. The character is essential to the frame but does not drive a sharp reversal or trade-off on the page. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; functional but not indispensable to a causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The thread appears twice: handed to Aris in the interview and felt/carried in the final paragraph. It is the physical inheritance and "undercurrent that holds the pattern together," reweighted at closure as "the weft held." Early signal, lyric reprise, and closure linkage are strong. However, the thread does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as symbolic anchor rather than active element. Strong integration for resonance, but swappable for another heirloom without structural break.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is the explicit frame: Aris writes obituaries for the living, Elara's life needs witness, and the garden is shaped around the absence of a homeland. The concept is signaled early, developed in the interview, and reweighted at closure ("soon to shape the absence of her"). It shapes the dominant stake but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Present in all three gates; functional, but the mechanics are thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is embodied in the prose style and the garden rendering (rust, gold, crimson, frosted hedges, woodsmoke, fallen apples). The attribute constrains the pacing—long descriptive passages slow the interview—and charges the final image with sensory specificity. However, it does not enable a distinct on-page action or present a visible trade-off; it is a tonal filter rather than a plot-active trait. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; strong sensory work, but does not drive a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intimate" is invoked explicitly ("the action intimate in the quiet clearing") and embodied in the shared silence and the hour-long interview. The action appears in the middle beat and is referenced at closure. However, it is observational and reflective rather than a major turn; removing "intimate" and replacing it with "witnessing" or "listening" would not break the story logic. Functional, present in two beats, but swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"By projecting presence" is asserted in one sentence near closure: "his method was not mere transcription, but by projecting presence." The means is not signaled early or demonstrated in the interview mechanics; it arrives as an explanatory label rather than shaping Aris's attempts or tactics. It does not constrain a choice or enable a beat. Late arrival, summary-only, ornamental use: cap at 4.6, adjusted down for lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden is signaled in the opening, rendered in rich detail, and serves as the spatial anchor for the interview and final reflection. It pressures mood and symbolizes sanctuary/loss, and at closure it becomes "a different place, a monument." The setting does not constrain a tactical choice or provide a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric crucible and thematic echo. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; strong sensory integration, but passive in terms of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last ship sails") is signaled in the opening and establishes Aris as stranded until spring. It tightens the frame (he is stuck, must engage the garden) and is referenced at closure ("The last ship was gone"). However, the time constraint does not alter a tactical choice or create urgency within the interview; it is a frame condition rather than a live clock. Present in setup and payoff, but does not shape middle decisions; functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Aris's motivation ("to understand the geography of healing") is stated in the opening and referenced at closure ("his own healing, his endless travel"). It drives his choice to visit Elara and frames his final reflection. However, the motivation is told and thematic rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices or visible friction between wants and costs. Present in setup, middle (implied in the interview), and payoff; shapes the dominant stake, but not tested under pressure with on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is embodied throughout: "tapestry of decay and lonesome splendor," "vivid hues of rust and gold," "the intimacy of the shared hour," and at closure "The lonesome splendor of the night." Tone is coherent, modulates with Elara's death (quiet to monument), and charges the final image. The tone does not constrain a choice but is integral to voice, atmosphere, and thematic resonance. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; strong tonal control that supports closure without being causally indispensable.</comment>
