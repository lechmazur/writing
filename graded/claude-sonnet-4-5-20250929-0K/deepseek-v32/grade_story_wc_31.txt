<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jonas's longing to discover the color of sound is established early and drives his descent into the wreck, but his interior life leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "tend his lights" as a keeper of flame and music feels more like acceptance of a gift than a decision with visible cost—he gains perception without forfeit. Interiority occasionally slips into elevated register ("profound meteor hush," "eternal discovery") that reads as authorial rather than a lamplighter's particular idiom. The transformation lacks the friction of renunciation or trade-off that would elevate it past competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Jonas gains synesthetic perception, reweighting his nightly routine). The library discovery and folio diagram provide a meaningful deepening that narrows his quest from abstract longing to concrete answer, and the final image of him hearing the gaslights' hum with color charges prior material. Cost is implied—he now perceives a layer others cannot, a solitary burden—but the cost remains oblique rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or consequence on the page, preventing entry to the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pier, shipwreck hull, and moss-lit library are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (barnacled ribs, salt and vellum scent, glowing moss). The library's spatial logic is clear and the moss-light provides both atmosphere and practical illumination. However, the environment serves primarily as backdrop; Jonas's choices are not constrained by setting features—the door simply opens, the folio rests waiting, and he leaves without navigating obstacles. The micro-setting does not pressure tactics or alter outcomes, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and pursued through the descent and library exploration. One meaningful deepening occurs when the folio diagrams pulse with light, answering Jonas's lifelong question and reweighting his perception. Agency is present (he chooses to enter, to trace the diagram, to return and light the lamps), but the escalation is gentle: the library offers answers freely, and Jonas faces no material obstacle or competing pressure. The resolution lands without visible sacrifice—he gains insight and retains his routine—so cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Jonas's quest and the library's revelation: perception is layered, and truth hides behind truth. The folio's marriage of light and sound and the final image of gaslights singing quietly to him alone provide a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "luminous vows" motif charges the ending by reweighting the sky lanterns' collective hope into Jonas's solitary new perception. The piece resists tidy resolution—Jonas now sees what others cannot, a conceptual cost—though the final paragraph's phrase "the truth was no longer hidden" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; distance remains consistent with no head-hopping. Voice texture is lyric and elevated ("a solitary dance of flame and glass," "meteor hush"), which fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts from a working lamplighter's plausible idiom toward authorial poeticism. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—Jonas's perceptual focus narrows during the library discovery and opens again at the pier. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("understood," "realized," "seemed") are used sparingly and do not dull immediacy, but the consistent lyricism across high and low pressure suggests limited modulation under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is dense ("vault of stars," "barnacled ribs," "ghostly light") and mostly coherent, though "meteor hush" as a metaphor for silence is strained—meteors do not inherently connote hush, and the phrase recurs without clarifying its vehicle. The phrase "truth often hides behind truth" in the fourth paragraph is abstract philosophizing mid-scene, briefly stalling momentum. Opening and closing lines are strong, but the sustained lyricism across all beats flattens propulsion slightly, preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—a lamplighter discovering synesthesia through a hidden library in a shipwreck—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation, longing, and found knowledge. The sky lantern festival and "luminous vows" diagrams are specific and non-generic. However, the core arc (solitary seeker finds magical answer in hidden space, gains new perception, returns changed) follows a familiar quest-and-revelation template. The transformation is executed cleanly but predictably; Jonas faces no moral calculus or risk, and the resolution grants him a gift without requiring sacrifice or subversion of expectation. The piece commits fully to its lyric tone but does not transform the template through bold structural or ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jonas as lamplighter is present from the opening and his routine frames the story. His choice to follow the compulsion into the wreck and to trace the folio diagram drives two key beats. The occupation matters thematically—he is a keeper of light who discovers light's sound—and the final return to lighting gaslights with new perception charges the closure. Early signal, two beats, and closure linkage with thematic specificity elevate the score. However, his decisions feel guided by wonder rather than constrained by cost or competing pressure, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag appears when Jonas finds the chain on the door (beat 1) and is mentioned again as "heavy in his pocket" after the library revelation (beat 2). Its "room number 317" detail is specific, but the tag's narrative function is minimal—it unlocks the door but does not constrain later choices or reweight meaning at closure. The "transient rest" / "eternal discovery" contrast in paragraph five reads thematic rather than causal. Present in two beats but ornamental, with no closure participation beyond a metaphoric nod.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" appears first as the festival name (Night of Luminous Vows, paragraph 1), is revealed as ancient diagrams in the library folio (paragraph 4), and returns implicitly in the final image when Jonas perceives the gaslights' "quiet, colorful music." The concept shapes the central stake—Jonas seeks the marriage of light and sound—and the folio's vows provide the answer that transforms his perception. Early signal, middle revelation, closure participation, and high specificity (the exact gold hue of collective hope). The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is articulated mid-story ("truth often hides behind truth; the wreck was not just a ship") as Jonas enters the library. The attribute informs his realization that perception is layered, but it functions as thematic commentary rather than a trait that constrains action. It does not shape a choice with visible cost—Jonas simply accepts the deeper layer when presented. Present in one beat as an insight, with oblique closure relevance (his new perception reveals hidden strata), but does not enable or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Signify" appears most clearly when the door's groan "seemed to signify a shift in the world itself" (paragraph 2). The word recurs conceptually in Jonas's realization that sounds have hues and in the final image where gaslights "sang to him alone." The action redefines Jonas's quest from abstract longing to concrete transformation. Early signal, middle use, and closure echo with thematic weight. However, the word itself could be swapped for "mark" or "herald" without structural loss, and the action is more conceptual than physical, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is named in paragraph 2 ("He was wandering purposefully, drawn by a compulsion he could not name") as Jonas leaves the pier. The paradox of aimless direction shapes his descent to the wreck—his feet move "almost without his command"—and the compulsion is later answered by the library's revelation. The method is signaled early and its mechanics (intuitive pull versus conscious plan) matter to the discovery. One strong beat and thematic closure link, but the method does not constrain later tactics once he's inside the library, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken ship is introduced at the structural midpoint (paragraph 2) and occupies paragraphs 3–4. It provides the folio diagrams that answer Jonas's quest, and its "deeper interior quiet" contrasts the meteor hush outside, deepening the story's acoustic theme. The library supplies the resource (knowledge) that alters outcome, and Jonas's return to the pier in the final paragraph demonstrates the setting's transformative impact. Setup, development, and closure participation with strong specificity. However, Jonas does not navigate obstacles within the library—it simply offers answers—so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sky lantern release is named in the opening ("Night of Luminous Vows") and frames Jonas's initial longing as he watches the "first golden orbs" drift upward. The event's timing creates the "meteor hush" that primes his departure, and the lanterns' gold hue returns when the folio diagram pulses with their color. Jonas leaves "as the last of the sky lanterns faded," bracketing the discovery. Early signal and closure bracket with thematic reprise. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Jonas is not racing the lanterns—and elapsed time is vague, so the clock does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jonas's desire "to discover the color of sound" is named as his "oldest, most private longing" in paragraph 1 and drives every subsequent choice: following the compulsion, entering the wreck, examining the folio, and returning to the pier with new perception. The motivation is dramatized through his actions and rewarded at closure when he hears the gaslights' hum and sees "the color of its steady flame's song." Early signal, continuous pressure across all beats, and closure fulfillment with conceptual cost (solitary knowledge). The longing could bear more internal friction—Jonas never doubts or weighs the cost—but it is deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced in paragraph 1 as "a silence so deep it felt like the sky holding its breath" and recurs when Jonas enters the library ("an even deeper interior quiet"). The tone of profound, expectant silence coheres across the descent and discovery, modulates subtly (outside hush to interior quiet), and charges the final image of gaslights singing "under the endless, hushed sky." Early signal, modulation under pressure, and closure participation. However, the tone remains relatively static—quiet wonder throughout—without sharp contrast at peak beats, limiting dynamic range.</comment>
