<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("puzzle out new equations for hope") is stated abstractly rather than grounded in specific contradiction or embodied need. Her actions trace a smooth professional path—survey, find object, reroute power—without visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment shows "stoic wonder," but no on-page micro-choice that reveals cost or forecloses a path; the caretaker's nod acknowledges completion, not a change Elara has undergone with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes spatial anchors (terminal, atrium, substation) and a clear goal (resurrect the fountain with light). The closure—holographic trajectories replacing water—lands on the page and reweights the terminal's "maze of intentions" into a coherent vision, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique: Elara's stance at the end is unchanged from her entry, and no visible price (resource spent, option foreclosed, relationship altered) appears in the final image, weakening the RR's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered—"ghost-lights," "dusty carnival stalls," "dry fountain," "skeletal pumps"—and spatial choreography is clear across moves (corridor, atrium, substation). The sextant piece functions as a tool (calibration wrench) that enables the central action, meeting the micro-setting standard. The environment supplies resources (backup grid, projector feeds) that Elara repurposes, constraining her method and shaping the closure image with star-chart trajectories bathing the sculpture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect the fountain's soul through creative repurposing—is signaled early and pursued coherently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara traces the carnival's projector feeds and reroutes circuits, narrowing her method from abstract theory to concrete action. The final switch produces the holographic display, but the turn is mechanical rather than costly: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forces a harder choice, and the resolution feels like successful execution rather than a stake-raising reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of hope as direction rather than feeling emerges organically from Elara's actions and the terminal's "maze of intentions" coalescing at closure. The sextant piece and holographic star-paths recur with reweighted meaning, charging the final image without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt language—"equations for hope," "silent, brilliant display was an answer written in light and vector"—and the caretaker's nod risks thematic echo by affirming the resolution too neatly, pulling resonance toward statement rather than leaving it fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register—"stoic wonder," "colossal space," "silent cathedral of human endeavor"—that fits an architectural intern's perspective under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective (stress fractures vs. "poetry of failed movement"), and no head-hopping occurs. Minor diction elevation ("cavernous space felt like a heart that had stopped beating") occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction, but remains voice-motivated and legible throughout, with no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The opening anchors voice and setting efficiently. Two paraphrase moments weaken momentum: "silent eruption" / "ribbons... streamed upward" and "the maze of intentions... suddenly cohered" / "every ramp and gate had been designed for this moment" restate the same realization without added pressure. Stock metaphor "heart that had stopped beating" and elevated abstract phrasing ("poetry of failed movement," "silent cathedral of human endeavor") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy slightly but not obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of abandoned spaceport, carnival remnants, and holographic resurrection offers a fresh synthesis that feels coherent in hindsight. The sextant-as-wrench detail and star-chart-driven projectors are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—curious intern restores meaning to derelict space, validated by mythic caretaker—follows a familiar restoration/redemption template without transforming it through bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The premise is executed competently but does not surprise or deepen beyond its setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's role as "curious civil engineering intern" frames her presence and capability (structural survey, circuit rerouting). Her decisions—trace conduit lines, redirect flows, throw the final switch—drive the resurrection action across three beats (discovery, substation work, closure). However, her choices feel procedural rather than stake-altering: no trade-off or cost is visible, and observation dominates over transformative decision. Introduced early, causally involved, but mid-band due to lack of friction or visible price tied to her profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in two beats: discovered in the corridor and used as "impromptu calibration wrench" at the substation. Its star-chart data seeds the holographic display, linking discovery to closure thematically. However, its function as wrench is ornamental—any tool could substitute—and its closure role is data-supply rather than charged reprise. The object is present and logically consistent but swappable in its mechanical use, capping it below necessity despite thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named twice: paragraph two describes the terminal's "labyrinth of conflicting architectural visions," and the penultimate paragraph states "the maze... suddenly cohered." It shapes Elara's interpretive stance (seeing systems as repurposable) and is reweighted at closure when ramps and gates cohere around the moment of departure. However, it remains thematic framing rather than a constraint that narrows her tactical options on the page, landing it mid-band for shaping one key realization without forcing harder choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is demonstrated through Elara's approach: "she saw systems not as they were, but as they could be repurposed." This trait enables her to trace carnival feeds and redirect power, driving the central action across two beats (theory formulation, circuit rerouting). The trait is enacted rather than merely labeled. However, no visible trade-off or cost accompanies this creativity—no resource limit, no failed attempt, no friction—so it enables without constraining, capping it in the mid-5s despite clear on-page use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the central action: Elara's goal from paragraph four ("resurrect the fountain... with light and memory"), executed in paragraphs six–seven (throw switch, holographic eruption), and validated at closure ("resurrected not the fountain's function, but its soul"). It drives three beats, redefines the terminal's meaning from decay to departure, and is irreplaceable—no minor edit could substitute another verb without losing the thematic weight of restoration. Strong causal role and closure linkage; slightly shy of indispensable due to procedural smoothness (no failed resurrection attempt raises cost).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in paragraph four ("she could redirect those flows"), enacted in paragraph five (rerouting circuits at the substation), and realized in paragraph six (power hum, holographic display). The method shapes Elara's tactical approach and is specific to the terminal's dual power grids (spaceport backup + carnival temporary). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized with friction or failure, and the method could be swapped for another technical solution with minor edits. Present across setup, action, and payoff, but mid-necessity due to generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "abandoned spaceport passenger terminal" anchors all action from paragraph one onward, supplies resources (backup grid, projector feeds, dry fountain, substation), and its architecture ("swooping ramps," "departure boards," "central atrium") is reweighted at closure as a "maze of intentions" that coheres around departure. The setting constrains Elara's method (she must work with existing infrastructure) and charges the final image (sculpture bathed in starflight within the terminal dome). Essential across beats and ending, nearing indispensability but not quite there due to the terminal's function being more stage than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" is mentioned once in the opening ("packed up and left just two days prior") to establish the terminal's current state (scuff marks, carnival stalls, projector feeds still in place). The timeframe does not create urgency, tighten decisions, or track as a live clock; Elara's survey and resurrection proceed without temporal pressure. The carnival's recent departure supplies the projector infrastructure Elara uses, a functional but replaceable setup condition. Present as context, minimal tactical influence, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraph one as Elara's motivation and echoed at closure ("Hope was not a feeling, but a direction"). The desire frames her interpretive lens (notes on "poetry of failed movement," systems as repurposable) and drives her goal to resurrect the fountain's soul. However, the motivation is told abstractly rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost: no scene moment shows Elara choosing hope over despair, safety, or efficiency with a price. Present early, thematically consistent, but mid-band due to lack of embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" appears three times—opening ("stoic wonder"), midpoint ("cavernous space felt like a heart"), and closure ("her face a mask of stoic wonder")—modulating from solitary observation to shared acknowledgment with the caretaker. The tone is coherent through turns, balancing clinical detail (stress fractures, conduit lines) with lyric elevation (silent cathedral, stars fall upward) without jarring. It charges the final image by holding emotional restraint against the holographic spectacle's grandeur, though the phrasing risks becoming a repeated label rather than fully embodied perception under pressure.</comment>
