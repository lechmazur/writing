<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (favor listening over noise) is established early and drives her peak choice, but her "credibly curious" trait functions mostly as a label without visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves smoothly from data to decision without the ambivalence that high-stakes choices warrant. The barometer glue refrain recurs without constraining a choice; it reads as ornamental motif rather than embodied pressure. Micro-choices exist (grasping the rope, pulling once) but lack the competing impulses that would earn higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated anchors (solstice hush, glue drying, microclimate tracking) and converges on the bell-toll decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara renounces the siren in favor of the bell with visible cost (trust, measured response). Orientation is clear by ~80 words (windblown sanctuary, storm siren tester). One meaningful tightening occurs (zero hour arrival, pressure drop, bell pull), but the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—"be alert, but not afraid" tells us the outcome rather than showing disruption or relief. The accumulative design lands, but the final image lacks the undeniable charge needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary and cathedral tower are anchored early and recur. The bell rope is handled on-page (roughness, vibration traveling into bones) and constrains the peak choice, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is selective (solstice hush, coiled rope, narrow stairs) but reads slightly generic—"windblown," "thick and worn," "narrow and steep" could apply to many towers. The barometer and gauges are named but not shown altering a tactic. Spatial choreography is clean, and the rope's physicality charges the closure moment enough to enter mid-6s, but vivid irreplaceability is missing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent panic while staying accurate. One meaningful tightening occurs when zero hour arrives and Elara's data contradicts the regional forecast, forcing a trade-off (siren alarm vs. bell warning). The choice narrows options and carries visible cost (trusting instruments over authority, risking under-warning). However, the storm's convenient fracture removes consequence—had it intensified, her choice would have mattered more. Agency is present (she decides, pulls the bell) but the outcome arrives without friction, reducing the felt price. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens but lacks the bite needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (listening over noise, humility vs. alarm) emerges from particulars: childhood noise, wolf-crying alarms, the bell's clarity. The final image (bell toll, people alert not afraid) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rope/siren contrast and the solstice hush's recurring weight. Yet the theme statement "her motivation to favor listening over noise had preserved the peace" in the penultimate section edges toward summary, and "harmony between warning and wisdom" in the final line tips into tidy closure. The concept integrates well, but the ending explains rather than trusts the reader, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (gauges, pressure fronts, remembering the last emergency toll) but generic—any cautious professional could think this way. Diction is clean and legible, but recurring phrases ("after the glue dried," "tracking microclimate variations," "solstice hush," "credibly curious") feel planted for prompt-element recurrence rather than voice-motivated rhythm. Filter verbs ("she remembered," "she had known") appear but don't flatten immediacy. No dialogue to judge. The prose serves clarity without distinct texture or compression that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "After the glue dried" appears four times, "tracking microclimate variations" three times, "solstice hush" five times, "credibly curious" twice, "zero hour" three times—most without added pressure or reweighted meaning. Template cadence runs ("She was… She stood… She grasped… She continued…") flatten propulsion in the middle third. Information density is low: many sentences restate her motivation or describe the sanctuary without advancing situation. The final third's "After the glue dried on future repairs, she would again face the switch" is pure scaffold. Clarity is high, but momentum drags under synonym churn and repetitive stems. Apply −1.2 for patterned loops and template cadence touching multiple beats (per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack); baseline 6.6 minus 1.2 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—siren tester chooses restraint over alarm—is familiar (wisdom-of-moderation template). Transformation is attempted via the cathedral bell and microclimate data, but the bell's symbolic weight (older ways, clarity not chaos) reads on-the-nose, and the data's role is told rather than shown in detail. The solstice hush and glue-drying refrain are poetic but ornamental; removing them would not break the plot. Emotional truth is present (trust in instruments, earned community faith) but arrives without friction—her choice is validated immediately by the storm's fracture, erasing risk. No bold structural risk; the arc is linear and safe. One fresh detail: the vibration traveling "into her bones" briefly lifts texture, but it's insufficient to counterbalance the derivative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present early (paragraph 1), drives the peak choice (bell vs. siren), and appears in the closure beat (pulls the bell, hears the echo, validates the choice). Humility is shown through her preference for measured response and community trust. Three beats: initial watch, zero-hour decision, final stance. Causal pressure is moderate—her choice narrows options and carries implied cost (if wrong, lives at risk), though the convenient storm fracture softens it. Irreplaceability is partial; another cautious professional could make the same arc, but "humble storm siren tester" is specific enough to anchor the role. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.5, cost visible +0.4 = baseline 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Object introduced early (paragraph 6), handled twice (running fingers along fibers, grasping and pulling), and charges the closure (vibration into bones, resonant note). Two distinct beats: tactile memory mid-story, peak action at zero hour. Causal pressure: enables the alternative to the siren, shapes the final choice. Closure linkage strong—the bell's sound is the culminating act. Specificity high: "thick and worn," "roughness familiar," "vibration traveled up the rope"—these details matter. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = 7.2 (round down). Could approach 8+ if the rope had constrained an earlier choice or if its symbolic weight carried visible cost beyond the convenience of the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Concept ("zero hour") signaled early (paragraph 10), shapes stakes (moment of testing), and appears at the peak beat (paragraph 27: "Zero hour arrived, marked by a sudden drop in pressure"). Two beats: initial prediction, arrival triggers decision. Causal pressure moderate—it sets the clock but doesn't narrow options beyond what "storm approaching" would do. Closure linkage present but not decisive; the bell pull is the closure act, not the zero-hour label itself. Swappable with "critical moment" or "storm arrival" without structural loss. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, swappability −0.6 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Attribute ("credibly curious") appears twice as a label (paragraphs 3, 25) without constraining a choice or enabling a tactic. No on-page cost tied to curiosity; her data-gathering is presented as routine competence, not a risky or obsessive trait. Setup present (paragraph 3), no middle development beat where curiosity forces a trade-off, closure mention is ornamental ("her curiosity was her guide"). Missing middle development cap at 3.4. Early signal +0.4, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3 = 3.2 (round down). Would need a scene where curiosity tempts her to delay or over-investigate, costing time or safety, to score higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Action ("switch") introduced mid-story (paragraph 16: "She stood before the switch"), frames the central choice (siren vs. bell), and is renounced at closure (paragraph 22: "she would not pull the siren switch"). Two beats: initial hesitation, final decision. Causal pressure strong—rejecting the switch is the decisive turn that defines the ending. Closure linkage high; the refusal is the Resonant Reconfiguration. Specificity moderate; "switch" is generic, but "the lever that would activate the great storm siren" adds weight. Late first appearance (paragraph 16, ~40% mark) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost visible +0.5 = 7.4 (round down). Irreplaceability is partial—"alarm button" would function similarly—but the switch/bell binary is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Method ("tracking microclimate variations") signaled early (paragraph 4), recurs four times, and informs the peak choice (her data predicts storm fracture). Two beats: initial routine, data contradiction at zero hour. Causal pressure moderate—it gives her confidence to choose the bell, but the mechanics are never shown (we don't see the charts or gauges in action). Closure linkage indirect; the method enables the choice but doesn't appear in the final image. Swappable with "weather analysis" or "instrument readings." Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.6 = 4.8. Would need an on-page beat where she reads a gauge mid-crisis or the data proves wrong, forcing adjustment, to score higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting ("windblown sanctuary above the clouds") introduced in paragraph 1, recurs throughout, and frames the final stance. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure). Causal pressure low—the altitude and isolation are atmospheric but don't constrain her choice; she could make the same decision in a valley tower. Closure linkage weak; the sanctuary is mentioned in the penultimate paragraph but doesn't charge the final image. Specificity moderate: "windblown," "above the clouds," "solstice hush"—poetic but replaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.3, closure linkage +0.3, swappability −0.7, ornamental −0.5 = 5.3. Micro-setting (body, rope) does more work than the macro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the glue dries") appears four times, marking repair completion and vows to trust instruments. Setup present (paragraph 5), middle recurrence (paragraphs 20, 33, 42), but no beat where drying time tightens a decision or costs her options. The glue is always already dry when mentioned; no live clock pressure. Closure linkage ornamental (paragraph 42: "After the glue dried on future repairs, she would again face the switch" is pure summary). Swappable with "once repairs are done" or any completion marker. Early signal +0.5, three mentions as one functional beat +0.4, swappability −0.7, summary-only −0.5, ornamental −0.4 = 4.1 (round down). Would need a scene where wet glue forces her to wait or improvise under storm pressure to score higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("to favor listening over noise") signaled early (paragraph 8), dramatized at the peak choice (bell vs. siren), and validated in closure (bell toll, people alert not afraid). Three beats: childhood memory establishes it, zero-hour choice enacts it, outcome confirms it. Causal pressure strong—the desire drives the entire arc. Closure linkage high; the bell is the manifestation of this want. Friction present but mild—her instruments remove doubt, so the choice feels safe rather than torn. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, friction mild −0.8, cost implied +0.4 = 6.4. Would score higher if her data were ambiguous or if choosing listening risked lives on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone ("solstice hush") recurs five times, anchors atmosphere early, and modulates slightly (deepens when clouds gather, returns amplified after the bell). Three gates present. Coherent through turns; the quietness supports her preference for restraint. Closure linkage strong—"the solstice hush returned, amplified by the bell's fading echo" charges the final image with the tone's weight. Specificity high: "solstice hush" is unusual and purposeful. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.7, closure linkage +1.5, charges final image +0.9, repetition without reweighting −0.5 = 6.6. One more tonal shift—panic breaking the hush, then restoration—would push this higher.</comment>
