<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior motivation is clearly established—magnifying small kindnesses to address her own heartbreak—and her examination method (dust patterns) provides character-particular detail. The arc from "broken-hearted" to "intertwined with a resilience greater than its break" is earned through her concrete discovery work. However, her emotional states are often told rather than embodied ("her heart...felt at home," "her breath caught"), and the final transformation relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The button discovery and its interpretation drive her forward, but peak moments lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (archivist Elara, foster care file room, post-1865) land by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara places the archival note and encased button, accepting that her work magnifies hidden kindness without personal wholeness—a visible act with felt cost. Causality flows cleanly from button discovery → Samuel's file → dust-pattern analysis → donor identification → archival intervention. One meaningful deepening occurs when the "Button secured. For pride" notation reweights the entire investigation. The cost is legible in the final image: she leaves "not whole, but now intertwined," and the button's return to the folder forecloses the mystery she carried. Minor accumulation issues: the Aris backstory (regimental rolls, city directories) is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening causal texture in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "thick with the smell of old paper and despair," dust patterns as evidence, brittle pages sealed by moisture. The setting constrains Elara's method—she must work delicately with fragile records—and the infantryman's button "nestled in the dust like a fallen star" charges the closure when it returns encased. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (heavy door, swollen folder, floor, pocket, desk work). The post-emancipation timeframe provides historical texture (Samuel placed 1866, Aris mustered out '65, Union infantryman details). Minor limit: the file room itself does not evolve or press back against Elara's actions; it remains a static container rather than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elara seeks to magnify a small kindness buried in bureaucratic records. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dust patterns reveal the donor log's frequent reference, then the "Button secured. For pride" notation transforms the investigation from archival sorting into historical rescue. The button's agency (a planted seed of dignity) and Elara's choice to return it encased provide visible cost—she relinquishes the tangible mystery she carried. However, escalation is largely cerebral: cross-referencing names, scouring directories. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows Elara's options under pressure; the discovery unfolds smoothly without resistance. Samuel's transformation ("combative" to "settled") and Aris's identity are recounted, not dramatized, so the peak tension remains moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action: history consists not of "grand emancipations" but small, tactful gestures across "a chasm of silence." The infantryman's button is neither symbolic ornament nor forced motif; it functions as evidence, dignity-seed, and final encased testament, reweighted at each appearance. The closing image—"its hidden kindness finally magnified and waiting for the next seeking soul"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can small kindnesses alter trajectories?) without moralizing. Elara's arc intertwines personal heartache with the historical question, and the dust-pattern method embodies the theme of reading traces. Minor abstraction: "resilience greater than its break" and "emancipation's promises buried under neglect" edge toward thesis statement, but these are brief and do not replace scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in limited-third with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, with appropriate access to her interiority. The prose has texture: "swollen folder," "soft sigh" of yielding paper, "tactfully hopeful" as both descriptor and embedded attribute. Elara's perceptual signature—prioritizing dust patterns, dog-eared corners, worn edges—is specific and职业-particular. Minor voice issues: some diction drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara's own idiom ("intertwined with a resilience greater than its break," "testament," "chasm of silence"). Filter verbs ("felt a sudden, sharp connection," "believed it possible") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. The piece has no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the central discovery sequence (dust patterns → donor log → notation → Aris identification). Concrete detail is strong: "tarnished and missing its loop," "brittle page sealed by time and moisture," "worn thin at the edges." Minor line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loop in paragraph one ("emancipation had come, but its promises were still buried" / "forgotten records" / "lost in bureaucratic ledgers") restates the neglect theme three ways without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph four: "She held...against the paper. This was no accidental inclusion; it was a planted seed...Someone...had given...This was the small kindness" uses repeated demonstrative "This was" stems (−0.4). Stock metaphor "like a fallen star" (−0.2). Register drift: "intertwined with a resilience greater than its break" in the final paragraph feels thesis-like rather than Elara's lived perception (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat directly. Total routing to Q7: approximately −1.1, bringing the grade from mid-8s to 7.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovers a dignity-gift embedded in foster care records—is a fresh synthesis of historical detective work and emotional archaeology. The dust-pattern method (which pages stuck together, which corners dog-eared) is an ingenious, non-obvious investigative technique. The infantryman's button as relic and planted seed transforms a stock "found object" into a causally active piece of historical intervention. The story resists tidy moralizing and commits fully to its premise: Elara does not achieve personal wholeness, only connection to a larger resilience. Minor derivative element: the broken-hearted archivist finding solace in forgotten records leans on familiar caregiver-heals-through-service templates, though the dust-pattern specificity and button's dual function (evidence + dignity) elevate it. The transformation test holds: swapping names and setting would lose the post-emancipation urgency and the button's specific weight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken-hearted archivist is signaled in the opening line and drives all major beats: she imposes order, discovers the button, decodes dust patterns, cross-references Aris, and places the archival note. Her choices—picking up the button, examining dust, compiling findings, encasing and returning the button—create the story's escalation and closure. The "broken-hearted" attribute shapes her motivation (magnifying kindnesses to address her own loss) and is paid off in the ending ("her heart not whole, but now intertwined"). The character is indispensable; removing Elara collapses the entire investigation and thematic arc. All three gates present (setup, development, closure). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in four distinct beats: falls from folder (inciting), held against donor log notation (reversal), pocketed as "tangible mystery" (development), and encased/returned to folder (closure). It is both evidence and dignity-seed, transforming from accidental find to purposeful gift to archived testament. The button's specific properties—tarnished, missing its loop, Union infantryman origin—are causally active: they link to Aris Coleman's service and Samuel's shift from "combative" to "settled." The closure image (button encased, returned to story) reweights the entire investigation and makes Elara's renunciation visible. Removing the button breaks the plot logic and thematic charge. All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" is signaled early ("forgotten records," "human echo") and shapes Elara's dominant stake: uncovering Samuel's and Aris's hidden story. The concept pressures her method (dust patterns reveal what was frequently referenced) and the ending reframes "examined unknown" as "hidden kindness finally magnified." The core question—can unknown gestures alter trajectories?—is answered through the button discovery. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; Elara's choices are not limited by the unknownness itself. The ending participates but does not hinge on new unknowns or a reversal of knowledge. Two of three gates (setup, closure); middle development is thematic rather than choice-altering. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is present in the opening ("her demeanor tactfully hopeful") and echoed in the closing image ("tactfully hopeful gesture across a chasm"). It colors Elara's approach—methodical yet believing in human echoes—but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is shown in her careful handling of brittle pages and her interpretive generosity toward the button's meaning, yet no beat turns on the tension between tact and hope. The attribute is thematically consistent and participates in closure framing, but remains more label than lived friction. Two gates (setup, closure); missing middle choice-enabling beat. Lyric reprise without mid-scene constraint caps the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unfurl" drives the key reversal: Elara unfurls the brittle donor log page, which yields the "Button secured. For pride" notation that transforms the investigation. This action is the hinge between passive discovery (button falls) and active interpretation (connecting Aris to Samuel's change). The verb is specific and embodied ("worked to unfurl," "paper resisted, then yielded with a soft sigh"), and its mechanics matter—time and moisture sealed the page. Removing this action would leave the button's meaning opaque and collapse the causal chain. Present in setup (method implied), development (the unfurling), and closure (the result shapes Elara's final placement). Strong causal pressure and beat involvement across two distinct moments.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method "through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled early ("which pages were stuck together, which corners were dog-eared") and shown in action: Elara identifies the frequently-referenced donor log by dust evidence, then unfurls it. The mechanics shape her discovery sequence and constrain her approach (she must read forensic traces, not just text). However, the method is used in only one extended beat (donor log identification) and does not recur or face testing at closure. Present in setup (paragraph three) and development (paragraph four), but absent from closure, which focuses on the button's placement rather than dust-reading. Two gates met; moderate causal work but limited beat count. The method is specific and non-obvious but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The foster care file room is vividly established (heavy door, dust, old paper smell, swollen folders) and provides the spatial container for all action. It supplies the primary resource (Samuel's file) and the historical context (post-emancipation records). The setting pressures Elara's method—fragile, neglected files require delicate handling—and the final image of leaving "the room, its dust settled" provides closure framing. However, the room does not actively constrain choices or evolve causally; it remains a static archive rather than a pressure-applying environment. Present in all three gates (setup, development, closure framing) with moderate causal linkage and closure participation, but limited tactical constraint. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not substitute here; the room functions traditionally.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" anchors the historical moment (Samuel placed 1866, Aris mustered out '65, Union infantryman context) and provides thematic weight: freed children left "adrift," promises "buried under neglect." The timeframe shapes the button's symbolic charge (Civil War relic as dignity-gift) and the file room's contents. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; Elara's investigation proceeds without temporal pressure or deadline. The period detail enriches atmosphere but does not constrain action. Present in setup and thematically in closure, but missing from development as a tactical force. Two gates with atmospheric rather than causal pressure. Swappable with other post-crisis historical windows without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to magnify small kindnesses" is signaled immediately ("her secret motivation") and drives every choice: Elara examines files for "fleeting moments of grace," interprets the button as "planted seed of dignity," cross-references Aris to confirm the gesture, and places an archival note to preserve the act. The motivation creates friction between her heartache (personal loss) and her mission (magnifying others' kindnesses), paid off in the ending where she leaves "not whole, but now intertwined." The desire is dramatized through concrete actions—button examination, donor-log decoding, note-writing—and the cost (relinquishing the button, accepting her own incompleteness) is visible. All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage. The motivation is indispensable to the story's arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" as tone is coherent throughout: measured, forensic attention to forgotten details; contemplative but not detached. The tone modulates appropriately—curiosity at the button's discovery, intensity during the donor-log unfurling, quiet resolve in the closing placement. It charges the final image: "examined unknown had become a quiet testament." However, the tone remains relatively static across turns; no sharp tonal shift marks the reversal or escalates pressure. The phrase "examined unknown" is explicitly invoked at closure, which strengthens thematic resonance but edges toward meta-commentary. Present in all three gates with moderate coherence and closure linkage, but limited modulation under pressure. The tone supports rather than drives the narrative arc.</comment>
