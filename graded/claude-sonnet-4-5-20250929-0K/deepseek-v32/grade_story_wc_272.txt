<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior is consistently rendered through embodied grief (tracing the splintered box, working at knots), and the untangling action externalizes his psychological state. However, the epiphany arrives too quickly—"he knew, with a sudden clarity"—without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would earn the shift. The final determination reads slightly declared rather than demonstrated through a closing micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: untangling threads accumulates pressure and the final image reweights loss as "a thread in a larger tapestry." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian's hands "remembered the brush" and he leaves "ready to face the world with new eyes"—but the cost remains asserted in summary ("acknowledging the pain, the void") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is vividly particular: "circular room," "shelves bowing under dust-covered volumes," "carved oak table." The walls closing in ("gradual constriction") charges the middle pressure, and the shift to "sanctuary" with "dust glowing" at the end reconfigures the space. The tarot box and silk threads function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice (untangling) and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—facing grief and regaining creative capacity—is clear. The untangling provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, and the walls closing in creates situational pressure. However, agency remains largely internal reflection; the protagonist's physical action (untangling) does not face on-page opposition or force a visible trade-off. The resolution ("quiet determination") is named rather than tested by a concrete cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tarot cards and threads: loss as part of a larger pattern. The recurring image of tangled/untangled threads shifts meaning from confusion to understanding. The final line—"luminescent ache guiding him forward"—offers a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Slight deduction: the phrase "not as an end, but as a thread in a larger tapestry" edges toward on-page articulation of theme rather than letting the image alone carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elian's perceptual filter consistent (artist's eye on "splintered wood," "delicate, tangled threads"). Rhetorical questions as a device are pattern-taught and voice-appropriate. However, some phrases drift into elevated diction under pressure: "luminescent ache of memory," "bittersweet glow that hurt to behold" feel slightly authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue present; single-POV execution is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrasing loops and template cadence appear throughout: "This was the moment he had feared," "Was this all there was," "Why had he come here"—rhetorical stems repeat without variation. Metaphor density in the final third ("throat tightening," "luminescent ache," "threads of connection") stacks figurative language without clear physical grounding. Paraphrase loop at closure: "no longer fragmented, but a cohesive whole" restates "fragments of reality began to align" from two paragraphs prior. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6 baseline, touching closure raises to −0.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tarot-as-grief-work premise is familiar (artist regains capacity through symbolic object), and the lighthouse-library setting, while vivid, does not transform the template arc. The rhetorical-question device adds a voice signature but does not create a non-obvious synthesis. The ending—leaving with "new eyes," carrying the repaired box—follows a predictable recovery trajectory without a risky or unexpected turn. Solid execution of known material, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (opening the box, untangling threads, gathering cards, leaving) drive all beats. Setup early; middle untangling is the key development; closure shows him "ready to face the world." No sharp decision under pressure or visible trade-off, but his agency shapes the arc across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tarot box appears in paragraph 4 (setup), Elian opens it and spills cards (middle beat), and he places cards back in the "repaired box—not broken, but redesigned" at closure (payoff). Three beats; causal (enables untangling); closure linkage strong. The "repaired" state at the end slightly asserted rather than shown being fixed, preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is named twice: "reality was fragmented, a kaleidoscope" (paragraph 6) and "The fragmented reality intensified" (paragraph 18). It operates as mood descriptor and thematic label but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The untangling action addresses the threads, not the reality-state itself. Present but ornamental, mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear in five beats: "Why had he come," "Was this all there was," and others. They color voice and interiority consistently but do not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. No trade-off tied to asking versus not asking; the attribute is descriptive. Functional voice device, swappable with ellipsis or direct declaration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Redesign" is named explicitly ("he must redesign not his art, but his very perception," paragraph 16) and again at closure ("repaired box—not broken, but redesigned"). It frames the central turn from fragmented to cohesive. Setup by midpoint, development through untangling, payoff in final image. Strong causal and closure linkage; slight deduction for being more concept-label than physical action with mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Untangling threads is introduced (paragraph 13), occupies the entire middle sequence (paragraphs 17–25), and directly produces the resolution: cards "now orderly" enable him to leave. Setup, multiple middle beats showing mechanics ("fingers worked," "pulled a thread loose," "each thread freed"), and payoff (cards placed back). Causal pressure high; irreplaceable; closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Library inside lighthouse is anchored early (paragraph 2), the walls closing in mid-story creates pressure (paragraph 10), and the transformation to "sanctuary" at closure (paragraph 28) reweights the space. Three beats; environment shifts with emotional arc. The closing image includes the lighthouse beacon cutting through night. Strong setup and payoff; middle pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is named as the feared moment (paragraph 11) and returns as aphorism near the end (paragraph 34: "When the walls close in, we must descend..."). It sets the condition for descent but does not function as a live clock ticking through beats or altering tactics beat-by-beat. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; timeframe is more metaphorical than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Descend into necessary darkness" is named (paragraph 12), pursued through untangling ("pressed on into the darkness of his past," paragraph 23), and resolved ("Descending into that necessary darkness meant acknowledging the pain," paragraph 24). Setup, middle dramatization, and closure acknowledgment. The motivation is told more than shown through conflicting wants; friction between safety and facing grief is asserted rather than tested by a visible choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears three times: paragraph 21 ("luminescent ache of memory"), paragraph 29 ("dust glowing with a soft, luminescent ache"), and final line ("luminescent ache guiding him forward"). Tone is consistent and modulates from painful to guiding. The phrase charges the final image. Slight deduction: the exact repetition feels planted rather than organic; the tone is more labeled than embodied in sentence rhythm under pressure.</comment>
