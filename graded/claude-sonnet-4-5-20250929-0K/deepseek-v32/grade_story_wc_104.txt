<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("patiently strategic") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist demonstrates physical ingenuity with the chain-breaking ritual, yet emotional texture remains thin—her fear, doubt, or exhaustion are asserted rather than enacted in thought or sensation. The final choice (throwing the arrow) reads as tactical problem-solving without visible cost or foreclosed path; she gets the seeds and freedom without renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page—Elara escapes, retrieves the seeds, and steps into dawn—but the cost is unclear. What does she forfeit or lose? The automaton threat dissolves too cleanly via the arrow trick; no prior constraint or live option is visibly narrowed. The causal lens holds through most beats (chain weakening, piano-key decoding, light short-circuit), but the final reversal (arrow striking conduit) feels convenient rather than earned by prior setup. One meaningful tightening is present (wall falls, chains snap, vault opens), meeting the length's minimum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies vivid anchors (skee-ball lanes, frozen merry-go-round rabbit, piano bench) and the space constrains Elara's movements effectively. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes in slanted light, moth-eaten sheet music, copper wiring sparks). The micro-setting (piano bench, floorboard wiring) alters tactics at key moments, meeting the 9+ gate partially. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting participates in the closure image (stepping beyond the fallen wall into dawn light).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieve seeds to plant resilience) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens once through the wall's collapse and chain-breaking, but escalation relies on sequential obstacles (automatons, locked vault) rather than deepening cost. The final beat neutralizes the automaton threat without visible sacrifice; Elara's choice to throw the arrow resolves the problem without foreclosing another option or paying a felt price. Agency is present but the arc lacks a tradeoff that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and hope emerges from concrete images (seeds, dry soil, dust motes) rather than abstract statement. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("she would plant resilience, one patient, strategic step at a time"), but the image of seeds in barren earth carries thematic weight. The story resists full complexity—automatons are erased, Elara succeeds without renunciation—so the thematic question (what does hope cost?) remains unanswered on the page. "Staggering grace" is asserted in the closing line without prior embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Voice is controlled with purposeful diction ("staggering grace," "forgotten tokens"), though some phrases ("ritual she had repeated daily for months") drift toward summary exposition. Perceptual signature is present but muted; Elara's way of noticing leans generic (cold handle, creaking lid) rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose modulates appropriately during the high-tempo beats (arrow throw, automaton halt).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is strong across most beats. Two paraphrase loops appear: "years observing their routes" restates "patiently strategic" without adding pressure, and "staggering grace" recurs in the final line after minimal setup. Filter verbs ("believed," "seemed") are voice-appropriate and minimal. Template cadence is avoided, and information density is high in the piano-key decoding sequence. The final paragraph edges toward scaffold ("the promise in the vault," "potential for life") but does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The chained-liberator setup and carnival-vault combination offer a fresh synthesis, but the emotional arc follows a familiar underdog-triumph template without transformation. The arrow's dual use (key and weapon) is clever yet convenient—its conductivity is not seeded earlier. The decoding beat (piano keys as spatial map) provides ingenuity, but the stakes resolve cleanly without a non-obvious moral calculus or cost that reweights prior material. Specificity (iridescent crow feathers, germination-cycle intervals) lifts the piece above generic, but closure feels safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and drives key beats (chain-breaking, decoding, short-circuit, arrow throw). Her chained state constrains early action (stretching for the mallet, hooking ankle chain) and her choices advance the arc. However, her decisions do not create reversals—obstacles are solved sequentially without tradeoff. The "liberator" role is told more than enacted; she frees seeds but not another character. Present in closure (stepping into dawn) but causally passive there—her final act occurs one beat earlier.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears in three distinct beats: initial description (etched shaft, iridescent fletching), decoding comparison (etchings aligned with piano keys), and climactic weapon use (striking power conduit). Its strange fletching is specified early and its dual function (key and projectile) drives two pivotal beats. However, its conductivity is not seeded—metallicity or another property should have been cued. Reweighted meaning is partial: it shifts from puzzle-piece to weapon, but the transformation feels convenient rather than inevitable. Strong causal role prevents higher score due to the unearned conduit interaction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seed vault is present by the opening beat ("clandestine seed vault hidden beneath the merry-go-round") and shapes every tactical choice: Elara breaks chains, decodes the lock sequence, and impedes automatons to reach it. The vault's contents (dormant seeds, future forests) define the dominant stake and return charged in the closure image (gathering seeds, planting resilience). Its concealment beneath the frozen rabbit and hidden lock constrain her approach. The concept is indispensable—removing it collapses all motivation and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is labeled twice (opening exposition, final paragraph) but enacted primarily in one beat: the daily chain-weakening ritual and the observation of automaton routes. The piano-key decoding and short-circuit setup demonstrate patience and strategy, yet the trait is told more than constrained. No visible tradeoff arises from patience—she does not sacrifice speed or safety to maintain stealth. The attribute supports characterization but does not force a cost or enable a choice that another trait could not.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Impede" drives two major beats: the light short-circuit that confuses the first automaton and the arrow strike that halts the final automaton. Both actions are on-page and alter tactics (buying time to reach the vault, preventing alarm). The concept is signaled early ("impede the automatons") and returns transformed at closure. Removing "impede" would collapse the rising action—she could not reach the vault undetected. However, the final impediment (arrow) resolves the threat too cleanly without cost, preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The piano-bench decoding method is seeded early (guard's mutterings about "keys"), discovered mid-story (non-musical pattern of ivory and ebony keys), and executed on-page (etchings aligned with intervals mirroring germination cycle). Its mechanics matter—the sequence unlocks the vault. However, it appears only in one contiguous beat and does not recur or constrain later choices. The method is functional and purposeful but swappable with another puzzle mechanism (coded map, mechanical lock) with minor edits. Present in middle development, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies multiple functional resources: the piano bench (decoding key), floorboard wiring (automaton distraction), skee-ball lanes and glass counters (spatial orientation), frozen merry-go-round rabbit (vault concealment). Early anchor is strong ("abandoned carnival prize redemption center") and the space constrains movement (chains, fixed post, narrow reach). The setting participates in two beats (piano-key discovery, wiring short-circuit) and frames the closure image (stepping beyond the fallen wall). Micro-setting elements (mallet, cables) alter tactics. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The wall's collapse is the inciting timeframe signal ("The wall came down") and Elara's cue to move, appearing in the opening line. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions afterward—no countdown or advancing automaton schedule pressures her beats. The narrative clock is vague ("process of minutes," "soft whirring" signals approach) rather than tracked. The wall's fall enables escape but does not constrain tactics or recur. Present at setup, absent from development and closure. Functional trigger but replaceable with any external signal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to plant resilience in dry soil is stated early ("her motivation was simple") and sustained through every beat. The barren earth image bookends the story (opening dust, closing dawn light and dry soil). Her choices (retrieve seeds, impede automatons) are dramatized and goal-driven. However, friction between want and cost is minimal—she succeeds without renunciation or visible sacrifice. The motivation shapes tactics and closure participation but lacks internal conflict or tradeoff. Present across all three gates with strong causal role, limited by absence of dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears only in two places: the arrow-throw description ("with staggering grace") and the final line ("The staggering grace was in the dust itself"). The phrase is asserted rather than embodied through rhythm, diction, or image. Tone elsewhere is functional and clear but does not modulate to reflect grace or stagger—no lyric cadence shift, no syntactic stumble-and-recovery pattern. The concept is ornamental, attached to moments without shaping their texture. Present at closure but not developed or taught; easily removable.</comment>
