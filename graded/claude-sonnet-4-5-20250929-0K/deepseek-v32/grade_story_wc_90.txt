<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (unlock dimension via shadow work) is clearly stated, but her interior life remains abstract. The "shadow work" confrontation—accepting inherited sadness, acknowledging war's anger—reads as label-only therapy-speak without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional progression is summarized ("wave of inherited sadness," "slight buoyancy") rather than dramatized through具体 sensory degradation or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "push" feels declared rather than earned by prior on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines; no penalty. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara stitches shimmers into a lattice, density increases toward the tear's absorption, and the dimension unfolds as RR (Charged Poise/CR hybrid—possibility opens). However, the closure cost is asserted ("accumulated release of a billion sorrows") rather than made legible through a concrete on-page image or forfeited option. The "seam of reality" unfolding lacks a visible price Elara pays in the final beat; we're told she used "the last of the stitched energy" but no tactical choice or renunciation is dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship with fluctuating gravity plates tied to Elara's mood is purposeful and returns at closure (ship sighs, holds her light form). The observation dome strewn with photographs supplies spatial anchors and the faint shimmer detail filters through her task-focused POV. Gravitational lightness constrains her body during the final stitch (she drifts upward), directly shaping the climactic action. Minor issue: "patchwork of salvaged halls" and "ghostly corridors" remain somewhat generic; more specific debris or failing systems could deepen the setting's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock dimension) is signaled early. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density or pattern break; the stitching process does accumulate ("each memory a weight," "lattice of sorrowful light"), but the turns are summarized rather than dramatized with on-page choice. The final "push" is described as "not physical force, but accumulated release," yet no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears—Elara simply succeeds. Agency is present (she directs the stitch, guides energy) but the cost clarity needed for 8+ is missing; we don't see what she loses or renounces to open the door.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into possibility emerges through concrete particulars (shimmer on photographs, Kwan Yin's tear, gravitational lightness). The final image—dimension unfolding "like a flower, with a sound like a million whispers forgiving themselves"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, "she had not forced entry but invited an opening" edges into explicit moralizing about pacifism, and "shadow work to transform grief into a key" risks thematic echo. The piece avoids heavy-handed summary but hovers near it; the closing lines ("her resolve now a permanent light") drift toward abstraction rather than staying rooted in concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices shimmer, feels gravity shift) but diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("ghostly resolve," "formidable power," "serene determination") that reads writerly rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt," "she saw") cluster in some beats without voice motivation. The phrase "a continuum where all ended things could begin again, gently" abstracts rather than grounds the POV in concrete perception. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks the rhythmic control and sentence-level modulation under pressure needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but several patterns reduce propulsion. Paraphrase loops: "she accepted the pain without retaliation, her pacifism extending even to her own heart" restates the same idea. Template cadence: "She lifted... She acknowledged... She directed..." runs appear. Stock metaphors: "ghostly resolve," "silent ark," "quiet, permanent light in the dark." The final third carries elevated diction ("formidable power," "serene determination," "profound, forgiving happiness") that drifts from concrete image into abstraction. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.3) = baseline −0.9 in Q7; final third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—last human uses "shadow work" to unlock a dimension via grief-charged photographs—combines familiar SF tropes (lone survivor, metaphysical portal) with pop-psychology framing. "Shadow work" and "Kwan Yin's tear" read as borrowed signifiers rather than transformed through specific world logic or character calculus. The gravitational-lightness attribute is a fresh touch, but the emotional arc (confronting inherited trauma to achieve transcendence) follows a template structure without a non-obvious turn. The ending's "unfolding dawn" and "door to what comes next" remain abstract rather than offering a concrete, surprising synthesis. Apply derivative premise adjustment −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and labeled "steadfast pacifist." She makes decisions (confront mother's photo, acknowledge war's anger, direct final stitch), so she clears the functional band. However, her pacifism constrains choices only in abstract summary ("accepted pain without retaliation") rather than in a concrete dilemma where violence is a live option she refuses with visible cost. The trait is signaled early (+0.3), appears in multiple beats (+0.9), but remains largely ornamental to the stitching plot; swap "pacifist" for "determined scholar" and the mechanics change little (−0.6 swappability). Final score: baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + beat involvement 0.9 − swappability 0.6 − label-only 0.3 = 4.3 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is introduced early as "the final component" (+0.3 setup), functions as the needle to stitch shimmers (+0.4 one beat), and at closure absorbs the lattice and pulses to help open the dimension (+0.7 closure linkage). Its property—captured compassion—directly enables the method. The tear dissolves in the final line, reweighting its meaning as consumable key rather than keepsake (+0.3 specificity). Causal pressure: it constrains the stitching method (+0.8). All three gates present. Minor issue: the tear's mechanics are asserted more than dramatized; we don't see Elara struggle with how to use it. Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + one beat 0.4 + closure linkage 0.7 + causal pressure 0.8 + specificity 0.3 + cost connection 0.3 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named as "confronting buried violence within her own soul" and mentioned in the opening and closing. However, the on-page process is stitching photograph shimmers, not dramatized internal conflict. The "deepest shadow: her own birth" and "shadow of war" beats are summarized in single lines without choice-altering friction. The concept shapes the thematic claim but does not change tactics or narrow options in a visible way. Present (+0.0 ornamental use), late specificity (mid-story detail −0.3), label-only (−0.3). Baseline 3.0 − ornamental 0.5 − label 0.3 − late detail 0.3 = 1.9 → round to 3.1 per positive setup mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Gravitational lightness is signaled early ("she became gravitationally lighter when happy" +0.3 setup), demonstrated mid-story ("slight buoyancy in her step" +0.4 one beat), and at closure ("her body grew gravitationally lighter, until she drifted upward" +0.7 closure linkage). It enables the final suspended stitch, a visible tactical consequence (+0.5 causal pressure). However, the cost is unclear: does floating help or hinder? The text says it allows her to "direct the final, complex stitch," but no trade-off or constraint is shown. Three gates present. Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + one beat 0.4 + closure linkage 0.7 + causal pressure 0.5 = 5.9; −0.5 for missing visible cost = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Stitch" is the core action: Elara stitches shimmers into a lattice using the tear as needle, then the final stitch channels energy into the tear to open the dimension. Signaled early ("stitch the shimmer... using the tear as a needle" +0.3), drives the middle process ("each confrontation was a stitch" +0.4 one beat), and culminates in "the final, complex stitch" that pulls the seam of reality (+0.7 closure linkage). Two beats involved (+0.9). Causal pressure: the stitching method is specific and irreplaceable (+0.8). All three gates. Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + two beats 0.9 + closure linkage 0.7 + causal pressure 0.8 + specificity 0.5 = 7.2; −0.5 for summary-heavy execution (we're told she stitches but don't see the difficulty) = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—using "faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs"—is named in the prompt and appears on-page ("faint salt trails," "shimmer lifted," "lattice of sorrowful light"). Signaled early (+0.3 setup), drives the stitching beats ("she focused, the shimmer lifted" +0.4 one beat), and at closure the shimmers "faded at last, their work done" (+0.5 closure presence, though passive). The mechanics matter: Elara cannot proceed without the shimmer. However, the method is told more than shown; we don't see her struggle to extract or guide the shimmer. Causal pressure (+0.8), specificity (+0.5). Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + one beat 0.4 + closure linkage 0.5 + causal pressure 0.8 + specificity 0.5 = 6.5; −0.6 for summary-only execution = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is present throughout. Its gravity plates fluctuate with Elara's mood (+0.3 setup), the ship "groaned" and "sighed in relief" as her emotional state changed (+0.4 one beat), and at closure "held her light form" (+0.5 closure presence). The observation dome supplies the chapel space for the ritual. The ship's responsiveness constrains her emotional state (she must manage her feelings to avoid destabilizing the vessel) and charges the final image. Two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.5). Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + beats 0.9 + causal pressure 0.8 + closure linkage 0.5 + specificity 0.3 = 6.8; −0.5 for the constraint being asserted rather than tested in a choice = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" is stated in the opening ("the last human born") and closing ("after the last human was born"). The timeframe is a background fact rather than a live pressure; Elara has no deadline, and the phrase functions as world-building detail rather than a ticking clock. No middle development, no closure participation beyond echo. Present but ornamental (−0.5), no tactical consequence. Missing middle gate (cap 3.4), missing closure gate (cap 2.8). Baseline 3.0 − ornamental 0.5 − missing gates = cap at 2.8; slight positive for opening/closing frame = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to push open a locked dimension"—is declared early (+0.3 setup) and drives all her actions (confronting shadows, stitching shimmers, using the tear). At closure she achieves the goal: "the dimension did not burst open violently; it unfolded" (+0.7 closure linkage). The desire is consistent across beats (+0.9 two beats). However, internal conflict is minimal; she never doubts the goal or faces a trade-off between the dimension and another want. Causal pressure (+0.8), but missing felt friction between cost and desire. Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + beats 0.9 + closure linkage 0.7 + causal pressure 0.8 = 6.7; −0.6 for told-only desire without on-page friction = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" describes Elara's consistent stance throughout ("ghostly resolve in her eyes never wavered"). The tone is coherent, modulating from sorrow ("wave of inherited sadness") to peace ("profound, forgiving happiness") without jarring shifts. It charges the final image: "her resolve now a quiet, permanent light in the dark." Setup (+0.3), present across beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7). However, "ghostly" and "resolve" are abstract labels; the tone is told more than embodied in sentence rhythm or sensory texture. Baseline 3.0 + setup 0.3 + beats 0.9 + closure linkage 0.7 + specificity 0.3 = 7.2; −0.3 for label-only execution = 6.9.</comment>
