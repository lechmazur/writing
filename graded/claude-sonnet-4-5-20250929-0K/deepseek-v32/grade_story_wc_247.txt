<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—translating silence into music through her camera and sign language—but her interior life remains largely abstract. Leo's arrival provides relationship pressure, yet his transformation from "haunted by city sounds" to understanding her world occurs too smoothly, without genuine internal friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "joyful sorrow" label recurs as assertion rather than embodied contradiction, and the moment where Leo "felt a joyful sorrow swell within him" reads as imported emotion rather than earned through his specific struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (harbor, moonlight, Elara with camera) and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara maps silence through framed stillness, then teaches Leo to perceive it as music. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo now "remembers" Elara and carries the silent song), but the cost remains oblique—what does Leo forfeit or risk by this perception shift? The final camera click toward the moon offers a charged image, yet the transformation feels more like witnessing than forfeiting, with the emotional price asserted ("joyful sorrow") rather than made undeniable through a specific on-page loss or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is vividly rendered ("basin of liquid silver," "play of light on water") and repeatedly anchored through Elara's mapping gestures—space between lanterns, hollow under the pier. These details constrain her method and charge the final image when she clicks toward "the moon's path." Spatial choreography remains clear (pier, moored boat, two lanterns), and the vintage camera functions as both tool and recurring object that shapes Leo's perception, elevating the setting from backdrop to active participant in the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's nightly task to map silence, and Leo's need to escape city noise—is signaled early and drives the encounter. The teaching sequence (camera, sign language annotations of harbor elements) narrows Leo's options from "hearing only emptiness" to perceiving a symphony, constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a visible price: what does Leo trade or lose to gain this perception? The disruption of his "inner turmoil" is declared gentle and profound, yet no prior choice or ongoing cost makes the transformation feel unavoidable rather than offered freely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the vintage camera with no film, sign language as dialogue, the harbor's stillness mapped into music—rather than direct statement. The recurring phrase "when no one remembers you" and "joyful sorrow" risk becoming thematic shorthand, but the ending offers a resonant image (Leo carrying "a silent song etched in his mind") that reweights Elara's isolation with the moment of being remembered. The final camera click toward the moon provides a non-literal answer to whether silence can be translated, though the "joyful sorrow" label recurs once too often, flirting with assertion over embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Elara, with clear perceptual signature (she "saw its dreams in the play of light on water"). The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("whispering advisor," "forgotten time") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. Sign language as the sole dialogue is a strong choice, rendering conversation concrete through gesture rather than speech. Minor slip: "he remembered" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward emotional ventriloquism, asserting Leo's future memory rather than staying strictly in Elara's present perception, though the effect is brief and does not destabilize distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("basin of liquid silver," "whispering advisor, her voice a ghost") is vivid without overwhelming. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The harbor slept, but Elara saw its dreams" closely echoes the mapping work already shown, and "joyful sorrow" recurs four times (paragraphs 10, 31, 37, 40) without evolving meaning—baseline −0.4 for recycled thematic label. Template cadence in mid-section: "She pointed to...signing a soft, high piano key. Then to...a low cello hum" reads list-like, though it serves the mapping method. Information density is generally high, but the final paragraph's "a melody of joyful sorrow, when no one remembers you" restates rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent music mapped through a filmless camera and sign language offers a specific, non-obvious premise. Elara's method—clicking the shutter to capture "nothing but the moment," then assigning sound to void—transforms the familiar trope of teaching someone to see differently. However, the emotional arc (Leo's healing through silence) follows a recognizable template: seeker meets guide, receives transformative perception, departs changed. The "timeframe when no one remembers you" remains intriguing but underdeveloped, more atmospheric label than constraint that shapes choices. The ending image (camera click toward moon) is earned, yet the overall trajectory feels safer than the premise promises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara (whispering advisor) is present throughout and drives the teaching sequence: she offers the camera, maps the harbor's silence through sign language, and chooses to share her method with Leo. Her decision to engage him ("gestured for him to join her") and the teaching beats constitute on-page choices that enable Leo's transformation. However, her arc is largely static—she performs her established routine rather than facing a new dilemma or cost. Setup is immediate, development spans the teaching sequence (two beats: camera, then mapping), and closure participation is present (final camera click), meeting all three gates and allowing eligibility ≥6.1. Causal pressure is moderate: her method enables Leo's shift, but her own options do not narrow. Closure linkage is visible (final click), and the camera/sign gestures recur across beats. Swappability: a "quiet mentor" archetype could replace her role with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. Cost connection is absent—Elara's isolation is asserted as "joyful sorrow," but no specific price is paid in the encounter. Apply +0.3 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal enable, +0.7 closure linkage = +2.4 from baseline 3.0 → 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film appears early (paragraph 5), is offered to Leo (paragraph 22), and returns in the final image (paragraph 39). It is handled on the page and its specific property—no film—matters: Elara clicks to "capture nothing but the moment," and she tells Leo to "Look...but do not capture. Listen with your eyes," making the absence of film integral to the method. Setup immediate, development in the teaching beat (Leo peers through viewfinder), closure participation (final click toward moon). Three gates met, allowing ≥6.1. Beat involvement: appears in three distinct beats (Elara's opening routine, Leo's use, final click) +1.4. Causal pressure: enables the perception shift +1.0. Closure linkage: final click charges the ending +1.2. Specificity: "no film" is functionally unique; a different tool would alter the logic +0.6. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +1.0 +1.2 +0.6 = 7.2, rounded down to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sign language is introduced early (paragraph 9: "She communicated in sign language") and becomes the sole dialogue between Elara and Leo, shaping their entire interaction. The concept constrains communication—Elara cannot speak aloud—and enables her mapping method, where gestures describe sonic choices. Setup immediate, development across the teaching sequence (multiple sign exchanges: "What do you hear?" "Look, but do not capture," annotations of harbor elements), and closure participation ("It maps," Elara signed). Three gates met. Beat involvement: sign language appears in four or more beats (introduction, question to Leo, teaching annotations, final exchange) +1.4. Causal pressure: the silence of sign language reinforces the theme and enables the wordless teaching +1.2. Closure linkage: Elara's final signed explanation participates in the ending +1.0. Specificity: sign language is irreplaceable; spoken dialogue would contradict the silence premise +0.8. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +1.2 +1.0 +0.8 = 7.4, rounded down to 7.3. Slight deduction for label-only trait in paragraph 20 ("The core concept of sign language became their sole dialogue")—reads as thematic claim rather than dramatized necessity, −0.3. Template cadence in teaching beats (repetitive "She pointed...signing...Then to...") −0.2. Final 7.3 −0.3 −0.2 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" appears three times (paragraphs 4, 19, 33) but remains label-only. The text asserts Elara's "quietly charismatic" presence and "demeanor," yet no on-page action demonstrates how this trait constrains or enables a choice. Leo's decision to join her and stay could occur with any welcoming mentor. Setup present (paragraph 4), development absent (the trait is mentioned but not actualized in a choice with cost), closure participation is cameo only (paragraph 33 restates the label without new function). Missing middle development gate caps at 3.4. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability (generic "magnetic presence" would serve equally) −0.6. Baseline 3.0 −0.8 −0.6 = 1.6, but label-only artifact across three mentions suggests the piece wants the trait to matter; allow slight elevation for recurrence to 3.2, capped by missing development gate at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is framed as Elara's action (paragraph 6: "she would disrupt the night's peace...by mapping silence"; paragraph 28: "she disrupted his inner turmoil"). Setup immediate, development in the teaching sequence (Elara's mapping disrupts Leo's prior way of hearing), and closure participation implied (the disruption is complete by paragraph 33). Three gates nominally met. However, "disrupt" functions more as thematic descriptor than irreplaceable action—Elara teaches, shares, transforms; "disrupt" could swap for "transform" or "reframe" without structural change. Beat involvement: appears in two beats (Elara's intention, Leo's experience) +0.9. Causal pressure: the teaching sequence does alter Leo's perception +0.8. Closure linkage: the disruption's completion is stated but not uniquely visualized in the final image +0.4. Swappability: high; the verb does not constrain method −0.7. Baseline 3.0 +0.9 +0.8 +0.4 −0.7 = 4.4. Lyric-resonance allowance: the word "disrupt" seeds in paragraph 6 and reprises in paragraph 28 with reweighted meaning (from night's peace to Leo's turmoil), allowing elevation into 5.5–6.3 range for purposeful echo. Adjust to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early (paragraph 6: "by mapping silence"; paragraph 14: "Mapping silence meant assigning sound to void") and its mechanics are shown: Elara frames segments of stillness with the camera, clicks to capture moments, then assigns sonic values via sign language to spatial features. Setup immediate, development across the teaching beats (she maps the space between lanterns, the hollow under the pier), and closure participation (paragraph 34: "'It maps,' Elara signed, 'by measuring the shape of quiet'"). Three gates met. Beat involvement: three or more beats (her solo work, teaching Leo, final explanation) +1.4. Causal pressure: the method enables Leo's perceptual shift +1.2. Closure linkage: the explanation appears in the ending sequence +0.9. Specificity: "mapping" is more precise than generic "translating," though still somewhat abstract +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +1.2 +0.9 +0.4 = 6.9. Minor deduction for summary-only mechanics in paragraph 14 (told rather than fully dramatized in that beat) −0.4. Slight label-only echo in paragraph 35 ("mapping silence into a form") −0.3. Final 6.9 −0.4 −0.3 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is established immediately (paragraph 1) and anchors the entire scene. The setting provides the raw material for Elara's mapping: waves, moored boat, lanterns, pier, moon's path. Setup immediate, development throughout (harbor features are mapped into sonic values), and closure participation (final camera click "toward the moon's path"). Three gates met. Beat involvement: the harbor's elements recur across all beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the specific features (space between lanterns, hollow under pier) enable the mapping choices +1.0. Closure linkage: "moon's path" charges the final image +1.2. Specificity: "luminous...by moonlight" is evocative but somewhat generic; "misty harbor at dawn" could substitute with minor tonal shift −0.3. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +1.0 +1.2 −0.3 = 5.3. Lyric-resonance allowance: the opening "luminous harbor by moonlight" reprises in paragraph 32 ("this luminous harbor by moonlight, he understood her world") and the moon returns in the final beat, reweighting the setting from scene backdrop to symbolic space of perception, allowing slight elevation to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" appears in paragraphs 2, 13, 33, and 40. Setup early (paragraph 2), but its mechanics remain vague—does it mean Elara is literally forgotten by all, or metaphorically isolated? The timeframe does not constrain on-page choices: Elara's nightly work could occur at any time, and Leo's arrival does not test or shift this temporal condition. Development is absent (the phrase recurs without altering tactics), and closure participation is decorative (paragraph 40 restates the label without new function). Missing middle development gate caps at 3.4. Ornamental use across four mentions −0.8. Swappability: "in her solitude" or "unnoticed by others" could replace without structural loss −0.6. Baseline 3.0 −0.8 −0.6 = 1.6. Lyric-resonance allowance: the phrase does accumulate slight thematic weight (from Elara's condition to the moment Leo "remembered"), allowing modest elevation to 4.1, still capped by missing development at 3.4. However, the phrase's recurrence and the pivot in paragraph 33 ("yet in this moment, he remembered") suggest partial development; adjust cap to allow 4.1 within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to translate silence into music" is stated early (paragraph 3) and drives every on-page action: framing stillness with the camera, clicking the shutter, assigning sonic values, teaching Leo. Setup immediate, development across all beats (her method is her motivation actualized), and closure participation (the final camera click and Leo's internalized "silent song" fulfill the translation). Three gates met. Beat involvement: the motivation underlies four or more beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the desire to translate silence shapes the encounter and constrains Elara's method +1.6. Closure linkage: the final image (click toward moon, Leo's carried memory) directly realizes the motivation +1.5. Specificity: the exact phrasing "translate silence into music" is precise and irreplaceable +0.7. Cost connection: Elara's isolation is the price of her art, stated but not dramatized as a trade-off in this encounter +0.2. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +1.6 +1.5 +0.7 +0.2 = 8.4. Minor deduction for told-only friction: the motivation is asserted "pure and persistent" without on-page conflict between want and obstacle −0.4. Label-only echo in paragraph 30 ("translating...silence into a music") −0.3. Summary-only in paragraph 3 rather than discovered through action −0.4. Final 8.4 −0.4 −0.3 −0.4 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is introduced in paragraph 10 ("The joyful sorrow of her task filled her") and recurs in paragraphs 31, 37, and 40. The tone aims for bittersweet resonance—beauty in isolation—but remains largely asserted rather than embodied. Setup early, development weak (the phrase is repeated without modulation or deepening), and closure participation present (paragraph 40: "a melody of joyful sorrow"). Three gates nominally met. Beat involvement: appears in four beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the tone colors Leo's experience and Elara's worldview +0.6. Closure linkage: the final line invokes the phrase +0.7. Specificity: "joyful sorrow" is a recognizable oxymoron but not uniquely integrated into this story's logic; "melancholy beauty" could substitute −0.4. Cost connection: the sorrow of isolation is claimed but not concretely traded against the joy of art −0.3. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 +0.6 +0.7 −0.4 −0.3 = 5.0. Label-only artifact: the phrase recurs as thematic shorthand without evolving embodiment −0.6. Lyric-resonance allowance: the phrase does seed early and reprise at closure, reweighting from Elara's private state to shared perception, allowing modest lift to 5.6.</comment>
