<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistently filtered through her "noticer" lens and enacted in concrete gardening choices. Aris emerges with clear backstory integration (the flour-dusted hands, the retreat motive). The official's softening feels slightly convenient—his arc compresses into a single roll without evident internal conflict. The micro-choices (clearing leaves, propping branches, offering bread) are visible but lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (city, palace garden, tea house). The closure unit is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Elara and Aris step forward as stewards, the official eats and leaves without filing—tenuous absolution holds. Cost is legible in "tenuous" and "as real as a seedling in cracked stone," felt rather than decisive change. One meaningful deepening occurs when Aris uncloaks and Elara becomes apprentice, tightening the stake from solitary ritual to collaborative defense.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tea house, overgrown courtyard, clay oven, and seedlings constrain multiple choices: Elara's entry ritual, Aris's hiding place, the test via bread placement, and the final demonstration to the official. Spatial choreography is clean (gap in gate, bower, hidden alcove, oven vent). Sensory detail is purposeful (caraway smell, egg-washed crust, frost on snowdrops). The setting charges the closure image directly: rosemary by the oven vent and trained ivy become the "living proof" that persuades.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: defending the garden and secret communion against institutional erasure. Pressure coheres through Aris's test (three days of bread), the apprenticeship deepening, and the official's arrival forcing public stewardship. The official's arrival is the key tightening, and Elara's choice to step forward and offer bread—risking exposure—narrows options. The resolution feels slightly soft: the official's capitulation lacks visible internal cost or trade-off on his part, reducing the felt price of the victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resistance to collective forgetting through small acts of care. The bread-as-communion metaphor deepens across beats without over-statement. "Tenuous absolution" is enacted rather than declared—the fragile pact, the seedling in cracked stone. The final image offers a resonant answer: sacred-in-ordinary is found and defended incrementally. Minor slip: "creeping normality" appears as a label in the opening rather than accruing purely from concrete detail, slightly diluting organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present (noticing birds' absence, light leaving). Aris's dialogue ("You didn't trample my seedlings") and Elara's ("We are just gardening") feel natural and goal-driven. The phrase "heuristically gentle" in narration is register-elevated and slightly academic for the established voice, a brief mismatch. Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext (the bread as silent test, the offered roll as argument).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no mechanical template runs. Information density is high in most beats. Two minor loops: "secret tea house" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without reweighting, and "tenuous absolution" / "tenuous" echoes formulaically. The phrase "a classic victim of creeping normality" reads as explanatory scaffold rather than dramatized perception. Figurative language is mostly purposeful (skeletal wisteria, flour-dusted hands), but "sacred geometry of dough" edges toward elevated diction. Clarity and momentum are strong overall; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—guerrilla gardening meets secret baker, testing character through bread—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the trope (hidden mentor, proving trial) through concrete acts (planting mint, baking at dawn) avoids generic everywhere-nowhere settings. The "impossible bread" from a vanished bakery is a fresh inflection that drives both mystery and moral logic. The official's easy persuasion trends toward familiar beats (the cynic softened by warmth), limiting full originality. Emotional specificity and lived-in detail (rosemary by the oven vent, wax-paper parcel) elevate the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as "creeping normality noticer" is introduced early and drives her daily pilgrimage, her gentle interventions, and the decision to step forward with Aris at the end. Her observation translates into gardening choices (snowdrops, mint, trained ivy) that create the proof offered to the official. The trait shapes two key beats (the ritual, the final demonstration) and is causally active at closure. Cost: risking exposure. Present in setup, middle development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bread appears across three distinct beats: discovery on the bench, second offering with oolong, and the warm roll given to the official. It functions as Aris's test of Elara's character, the communion artifact, and the climactic argument ("aroma an undeniable argument"). The bread's "impossible" freshness from a vanished bakery is irreplaceable specificity. It is causally central: without it, Aris does not reveal himself and the official is not persuaded. Setup, development, closure participation all present; visible cost tied to secrecy and risk of discovery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly mid-story and enacted at closure: the fragile forgiveness offered to a world "that did not yet know it needed pardoning." It shapes the stakes (why they garden and bake) and the tactics (offering care rather than argument). The official's departure "without filing a report" is the absolution holding. The concept constrains the final choice—Elara does not claim ownership but offers living proof. Present in middle and closure; cost is the precariousness ("as tenuous and as real as a seedling").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is introduced as Elara's ritual method early (clearing leaves, propping branches) and returns in the climax ("her voice heuristically gentle"). It enables her persuasion of the official and contrasts with "institutional rigidity." The trait is visible in at least two beats (gardening ritual, final confrontation). Tradeoff: the gentleness requires patience and vulnerability. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is thin—it does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. The phrase itself is register-elevated, slightly ornamental in narrative voice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "uncloak" (Aris emerging from behind the tapestry, revealing himself) is the major turn that redefines the mystery and stakes. It transforms the solo ritual into a partnership and sets up the apprenticeship and final defense. Without this reveal, the story remains atmospheric observation without causal escalation. Present in middle development and directly shapes closure (the "we" that steps forward). Irreplaceable: no near-synonym action fits. Cost: both characters are now mutually exposed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is signaled early (planting snowdrop bulbs, mint shoots in cracked flagstones) and its mechanics matter: the planted herbs and trained ivy become the proof Elara points to when confronting the official. The method shapes at least two beats (the ritual interventions, the final demonstration). It is causally active at closure—removing it would eliminate the "living proof." Setup, development, and payoff all present. Cost: the illicit act risks discovery. Specificity is high; this exact method (guerrilla gardening vs. overt petition) is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is setup immediately, used across all major beats (Elara's ritual, Aris's hiding and baking alcove, the site of apprenticeship, the official's survey target), and charges the final image. It provides the hidden oven, the gap in the gate, the flagstones for planting, and the rosemary-by-vent detail that becomes evidence. Spatial pressure: secrecy depends on the neglect; the official's intent to catalogue ruin is the threat. Irreplaceable: no generic "abandoned place" would carry the same symbolic and tactical weight. Setup, development, closure all present; cost tied to precarious tenure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is mentioned in the opening to establish seasonal atmosphere (autumn chill, frost on snowdrops). It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the story's timeline is vague (days pass, "one bitter morning" arrives without urgency). The timeframe flavors mood but does not constrain tactics or alter the outcome. Present in setup only; absent from development and closure participation. The element is swappable with any seasonal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is established early ("often unconscious," driving her daily pilgrimage) and dramatized through her gardening choices and acceptance of the bread as "silent communion." It is conflicted: the search feels "increasingly desperate." The motivation shapes the middle (becoming Aris's apprentice in "sacred geometry of dough") and the closure (defending the found sacredness "one loaf, one plant, at a time"). Cost: vulnerability and the tenuous nature of what is found. Present in setup, development, and payoff; visible friction between want and precariousness.</comment>
