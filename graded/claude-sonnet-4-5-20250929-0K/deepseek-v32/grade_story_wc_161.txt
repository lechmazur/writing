<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's central motivation (preserving lost songs) is clear and her grief-driven retreat is embodied through the attic clutter. The shift from isolation to collaboration with Henry shows progression, but his appearance feels instrumental—he materializes exactly when needed with perfect equipment and matching losses. The final choice to "sketch a new message" and open the door registers as conceptual rather than a difficult trade-off with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (preservation vs. suffocation) but the resolution into "small surrenders" reads closer to therapeutic insight than a dramatized struggle with competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines (Elara, attic of Whispering Spine bookshop, post-war present). Jasper's return provides a mild complication that triggers Elara's project, and the collaboration with Henry deepens the pattern of connection vs. isolation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of sketching a message and opening the door crystallizes a shift from preservation-as-freezing to preservation-as-invitation. Cost is conceptual—the surrender of total control, the acceptance that echoes must change—but the passage "Trust, she realized, was not a sudden leap, but a series of small surrenders" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The lens holds, but the ending explains more than it charges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The attic is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (decaying paper smell, dusty piles, skylight shaft), and the dust-mote mapping ritual creates a micro-setting that shapes Elara's daily method. The meteorite chip is handled twice (checking after Jasper's return, placing it back at the end) and the pre-war amplifier/phonograph become tools Henry retrieves from below. However, spatial choreography between attic and "depths below" remains vague, and the bookshop itself supplies atmosphere without constraining choice. The skylight and dust function more as metaphor than as environment pressing on action. Meets functional use but does not reach the gate where setting narrows options at a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the echo of lost songs while escaping suffocating grief. Jasper's return without a capsule disrupts routine and prompts the meteorite-chip transcription project, which requires Elara to leave the attic and ask Henry for help—a meaningful tightening that forecloses total isolation. The collaboration and the final decision to "sketch a new message" show agency. Yet the escalation reads as additive (dust-mote mapping → transcription project → shared creation → open door) rather than a single pressure point that narrows options with visible trade-off. The cost (surrendering solitary control) is present but more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One deepening suffices for this length, but the stakes remain more thematic than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—preservation versus life, echo versus change—emerges organically from Elara's mapping ritual, the meteorite project, and the collaboration with Henry. The recurring dust-mote image and the meteorite chip accrue meaning across the piece, and the final realization that "preserving an echo was not about freezing it in time, but letting it change form" offers a resonant answer to the central question. However, "Trust, she realized, was not a sudden leap, but a series of small surrenders" and "The blooming withering of her heart found a new rhythm" tip into direct articulation rather than letting image and action carry the insight. The closing image of the open door and new message invites reflection, but the thematic work is partly scaffolded by summary rather than purely dramatized through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. The opening establishes Elara's perceptual filter (paper trails, dust, meteorite talisman) and her voice modulates from retreat to cautious engagement. Sentence rhythm varies, though several passages rely on repeated stems ("She had to ask," "She learned," "She looked"). The line "her voice cracking from disuse" is a strong embodied beat. Dialogue is minimal but functional (Henry's simple nod is apt). However, some diction edges toward elevated lyricism that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "blooming withering," "music of the spheres," "ghost of a melody." Filter verbs ("understood," "realized") appear in peak reflective moments without muddying immediacy, but the narrator occasionally steps outside Elara's perceptual limits to claim cosmic perspective. No head-hopping, but the voice converges slightly under emotional pressure into generic epiphany cadence at the close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally sound, but several prose artifacts reduce density. Template cadence appears in runs: "Her motivation was simple yet vast: to preserve... Her method for enduring... Her most precious object... Her life had narrowed..." Paraphrase loops: "preserve the echo of lost songs" vs. "preserving an echo"; "dust-mote mapping" recurs without added pressure mid-piece. Stock metaphors: "music of the spheres," "sunrise," "foundation," "keystone." The final paragraph stacks reflection ("Trust, she realized..."; "The blooming withering..."; "what faded made room...") in consecutive summary beats without scene action, creating a minor loop. Filter-verb reliance ("understood," "realized," "learned") clusters near closure. Figurative density is high but some vehicles mix: dust swirls as both literal ritual and metaphor for connection without clear transition. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for template stems and paraphrase; additional −0.3 for stock metaphor strings; touching closure region triggers disallow 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise—reclusive pigeon trainer collaborates to transcribe cosmic vibrations from a meteorite—combines distinctive elements, and the attic/bookshop setting offers specificity. The dust-mote mapping ritual is a fresh inflection, and the shift from preservation-as-freezing to preservation-as-change provides a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc (isolated grieving artist learns to trust and collaborate) follows a familiar template, and the meteorite's function as magical catalyst remains asserted rather than dramatized with unique properties. The turn relies on Henry arriving with perfect equipment and matching losses, which reads convenient. Proximity check: "music of the spheres" and "fragile hope" are stock phrases. The piece commits to its vision but does not fully transform the derivative "healing through creative collaboration" scaffold into irreplaceable particulars. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 within Q8 for close match to healing-through-art template without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is identified as a pigeon trainer in the opening line and Jasper's return triggers the inciting disruption. However, her training skill does not create key turns—Jasper arrives as plot catalyst, not as a result of her choices or methods. She checks him for a message and later begins to sketch a new one, but these are passive observations and preparatory gestures. The decisive moves (transcription project, asking Henry for help) stem from her grief and need, not her expertise as a trainer. Present in setup and closure framing, but the occupation itself is ornamental. Two-gate participation (setup, closure cameo); no middle development where training skills constrain or enable tactics. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; functional but swappable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mars meteorite chip appears in three distinct beats: introduction as precious talisman on the desk, checking its surface after Jasper's return ("remembered the composer's belief"), and the transcription project using "archaic equipment, weaving them with fragments of music." Returns at closure: "placed the Mars meteorite chip back on the desk, not as a relic of loss, but as a keystone for a future symphony." All three gates present (setup, middle catalyst, closure reweighting). Causal pressure: the decision to transcribe the chip's frequencies drives the collaboration with Henry and the thematic turn from preservation to reinvention. Specificity: the claim that it "recorded cosmic vibrations" is told, not demonstrated through unique properties or mechanics on the page. Cost connection is indirect—using it requires asking for help, but no visible price tied to the object itself. Strong integration across beats and ending; deduct −0.4 for told-only mechanics and −0.3 for no direct cost. Eligible ≥6.1 with all gates; score ~7.1 for beat involvement + closure linkage + specificity claim, minus told-only friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Paper trails" is introduced early as the landscape of Elara's attic: "towering piles of ledgers, letters, and sheet music that she could not bring herself to organize." Returns in the middle: "using the bookshop's archaic equipment, weaving them with the fragments of music in her paper trails." Closure reprise: "The paper trails around her were no longer just graves for lost things; they were a foundation." All three gates (setup, middle resource, closure reweighting). The fragments of music supply material for the transcription project, shaping the collaborative tactic. However, "paper trails" also functions as metaphor (tracking, history) without concrete constraint—the piles could be any archive. The final reweighting charges the concept thematically but does not demonstrate irreplaceability; near-synonym "archive" or "collection" would serve similarly. Score ~6.8 for beat involvement + closure linkage, minus swappability friction −0.5 and metaphor/theme reliance without unique mechanics −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is stated explicitly: "Elara was reinventing her personal history, daily, telling herself she was a curator, not a fugitive from grief." This is label-only in setup. The attribute does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—her shift from isolation to collaboration could occur without the framing of "reinvention." The final beats describe her accepting change ("letting it live anew") but do not dramatize a moment where the act of reinventing history forces a trade-off or shapes a tactic. Present in setup as thematic claim; absent in middle development and closure participation. Missing two gates (development, payoff); cap at 3.4. Functional thematic echo but no causal work; score ~3.4 base, lifted slightly to ~5.3 for thematic coherence with the ending's transformation motif, but still replaceable and label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Balance" is introduced as Elara's central need: "to find equilibrium between preservation and life," "to balance the weight of memory against the need to breathe," "required her to balance fierce protection with open collaboration." The dust-mote mapping is "her first, fragile step toward balance," and the collaboration with Henry tests this further. At closure, "The blooming withering of her heart found a new rhythm" and the open door suggest achieved equilibrium. All three gates (setup stake, middle attempt, closure image). However, "balance" functions more as thematic statement than as a specific action that redefines options. The word recurs but does not name a discrete physical or decision-based act that could be swapped or removed; it is the story's conceptual goal, not a unique tactic. The piece could describe the same arc as "reconcile," "integrate," or "harmonize" with minor edits. Score ~6.4 for coherent thematic throughline and closure linkage, minus swappability −0.6 and abstraction (not a dramatized action) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" is signaled early as "her method for enduring each day" and "a ritual that imposed order on chaos." Returns in the middle: "Elara continued her dust-mote mapping, but now it became a metaphor, charting the unpredictable swirl of human connection." Closure: "She had mapped her isolation under the skylight only to discover she was not alone in the dust." All three gates (setup method, middle reframing, closure payoff). The method shapes her daily routine and provides the conceptual anchor for the shift from solitary observation to relational metaphor. However, the mechanics of the mapping are not shown on the page—no specific beat dramatizes her performing the ritual or using it to guide a choice. The method is told and thematized rather than enacted with visible constraint or cost. Score ~7.3 for beat involvement + closure linkage + early signal, minus summary-only use −0.6 and no on-page demonstration of mechanics −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vintage bookshop attic is established in the opening line with vivid sensory detail (decaying paper smell, dusty aerie, skylight, worn desk). The attic functions as refuge and prison, and leaving it to engage with Henry and the shop below is a key turn. Closure: "The attic remained a sanctuary, but now its door was open to the sounds from the bookshop below." All three gates (setup, middle pressure, closure image). The setting supplies the skylight (for dust-mote mapping), the paper trails, and the spatial boundary Elara must cross to ask for help. The bookshop's "archaic equipment" enables the project. Spatial choreography is present but vague (Henry retrieves equipment "from the cluttered depths below"). The attic's confined space does not constrain a specific tactic—Elara could transcribe in any room. Score ~6.9 for setup + closure charge + resource supply, minus generic boundary function −0.4 and vague micro-geography −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Learning to trust again" is stated as the timeframe: "The timeframe of her healing stretched out before her, a slow journey across learning to trust again." This is setup as thematic claim. The progression from Jasper's return to the collaboration with Henry to the final open door traces a trust arc, but no live clock or deadline tightens decisions. The phrase "One morning," "One afternoon," "as they worked" are vague temporal markers that do not create urgency or alter tactics. Trust accrues across beats but the timeframe itself is passive framing rather than an active constraint. Present in setup and implied at closure (trust achieved); missing middle development where time pressure shapes a choice. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup as active constraint. Score ~4.1 for thematic coherence minus vague/untracked time −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is Elara's stated motivation in the opening: "Her motivation was simple yet vast: to preserve the echo of lost songs, melodies carried by her birds that had vanished into the silence of war." Recurs when she checks the meteorite: "Perhaps the lost songs were not entirely gone." The transcription project is a direct attempt to preserve by transforming, and the closure reweights preservation from freezing to "letting it change form, letting it live anew." All three gates (setup, middle action, closure redefinition). The desire drives the central project and the collaboration with Henry. Friction: the motivation is declared rather than shown through a specific on-page choice where preserving songs conflicts with another want or costs something immediate. The final insight is reflective rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene. Score ~7.6 for beat involvement + closure linkage + early signal, minus told-heavy setup −0.3 and reflective rather than choice-based conflict −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is introduced as "The tone of her days was one of blooming withering, where a found fragment of a sonata could feel like a sunrise, even as it crumbled at the edges." Returns at closure: "The blooming withering of her heart found a new rhythm: what faded made room for what could grow." The tone of simultaneous decay and hope is coherent across the piece—Elara's grief, the crumbling paper, the fragile new collaboration. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is implicit in the bittersweet quality of the transcription project. However, "blooming withering" is stated twice in nearly identical phrasing rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image through varied embodiment. The tone supports theme but does not shift cadence or intensify under escalation. Score ~6.2 for setup + closure reprise + thematic coherence, minus static repetition without modulation −0.4 and direct labeling rather than tonal demonstration −0.3.</comment>
