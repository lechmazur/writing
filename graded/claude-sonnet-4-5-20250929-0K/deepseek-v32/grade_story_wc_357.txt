<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority remains largely exterior—she observes, travels, and completes her quest without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The climax shows no difficult choice: she kneels and plunges the arrow tip without cost, hesitation, or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is sparse; labels like "awe-struck" and "deep peace" replace physical sensation. The protagonist functions as a vessel for the concept rather than a person under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric discovery arc). Orientation anchors appear early (pilot, orchard planet, gravity inversion). The closure—plunging the arrow tip, releasing vitality—occurs on the page, but no visible cost is legible: Elara pays nothing, risks nothing at the moment of action, and the arrow tip becomes "dull and inert" without consequence to her. The piece moves through its premise smoothly but delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration without felt price, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, upward-flowing water, and bioluminescent cavern are vivid and specific. The magnetic boots and water current constrain movement in the inversion sequence, grounding the fantastic premise. However, the orchard itself—central to the premise—remains abstract: no tactile interaction with trees, fruit, or soil; no sensory hierarchy that reflects a pilot's professional eye. The arrow tip charges the final image, lifting the score into the solid 6-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation is spatial rather than conflictual: Elara follows water, enters the cavern, and succeeds without opposition, error, or trade-off. The inversion provides a ticking clock, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options. The climax is execution of a known solution, not a choice under pressure. One meaningful deepening (echoes coalesce, arrow glows) lifts the score modestly, but agency and cost remain absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—resilience as cumulative memory—emerges from the echoes gathering and the cyclic inversion rather than stated thesis. The arrow tip as conduit and the "gathering of echoes" offer a non-literal answer to the resilience question. However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("she knew her role was not just to pilot but to protect this cyclic rebirth"), and the piece avoids moral complexity: no competing goods, no ambiguity, no cost. The thematic resonance is present but gentle, fitting the 6-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt for a lyric discovery arc. Perceptual signature is functional but generic: "her eyes scanned for landmarks" and "she sensed a vibration" could belong to any protagonist. Diction is clean and consistent, with purposeful compression in the inversion silence. No dialogue present. The prose reflects urgency in short beats during the ascent but flattens into summary at closure ("awe-struck," "deep peace"). Voice is competent but lacks character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are solid; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Information density is high in the inversion sequence (water flow, magnetic boots, echo swirls). Minor issues: "whirling silence" is repeated verbatim across beats without reweighting; "That energy, she suspected, was the attribute that accelerated plant growth" reads as tell when context already implies it; "In the quiet after the inversion, she felt a deep peace" summarizes rather than embodying. The final image—orchards renewing, arrow tip inert—carries purpose. Line-level control is strong in the 6-to-7 range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating-orchard-with-inverted-gravity premise is fresh and fully committed. The gathering of echoes as cumulative memory offers a thoughtful synthesis. However, the narrative arc is template-quest: pilot receives artifact, follows clue, discovers source, activates solution without friction. Elara's role as intrepid pilot is declared but not tested; no mistake, no rival interpretation, no moral calculus. The ending delivers conceptual satisfaction but no surprise or risk. Solid mid-band for coherent vision without bold transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal drives all movement. However, her choices are navigational rather than conflictual: she guides her craft, cuts power, steps out, holds the arrow aloft, kneels, and plunges it. None of these actions creates a turn or forecloses an option; she executes a known plan. Setup and development are present, but closure participation is passive (she kneels and inserts the arrow without cost or decision). Swappable with any "intrepid" seeker. Caps at mid-4s for functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears early (passed from grandmother, lies cool in palm), is examined mid-beat ("jagged edges," "humming with latent energy"), and becomes the active tool at closure (plunged into the pool, releases shockwave, becomes inert). It shapes the climax and is irreplaceable in its function as conduit. However, no on-page cost is tied to it—Elara does not sacrifice, risk, or lose anything when it becomes inert. Three-gate presence and causal linkage lift it into the high 6s; lack of cost prevents 7+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" is introduced early as legend, dramatized in the cavern (swirls of light and shadow, memories condensing), and provides the mechanism for the climax. It defines the story's stakes and final image: the echoes activate the arrow tip, releasing vitality. Elara's realization—"not a place but a phenomenon"—reweights the concept on the page. Irreplaceable and causally central. Strong integration across all three gates with closure linkage earns solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Accelerates plant growth" is mentioned as the arrow tip's latent energy and shown in the climax (vines unfurl, blossoms burst in accelerated time). However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or create a tradeoff—she simply activates it. The attribute is outcome rather than obstacle. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak. Functional but not causal in shaping tactics. Mid-5s for mechanical presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Discover" frames the entire arc: Elara seeks the source, navigates to the cavern, witnesses the echoes, understands the mechanism, and activates it. The action is sustained and motivates all beats. However, discovery here is revelation without obstacle—she finds what she seeks without error, rival theory, or cost. The climax is execution, not discovery under pressure. Strong setup and development, but the action is more structural than transformative. High 6s for solid but replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Navigating by water flow" is signaled early ("navigating by water flow as the inversion began"), becomes the method mid-beat (water streams upward, cradles her ascent, "only the flow could guide her"), and leads directly to the cavern entrance. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally active across multiple beats. It shapes her path and integrates with the inversion timeframe. All three gates met with clear causal pressure. Solid 7-band for mechanical necessity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is vividly established and returns in the climax (orchards renew, vines and blossoms on arches). The arches frame movement (ascent between two immense arches, cavern within the largest arch) and the magnetic boots address low-gravity constraints. However, the orchard itself—central to the premise—is never tactilely engaged; trees and fruit are mentioned but not handled or tested. Setup and payoff strong; middle development thin. Mid-6s for purposeful but underused setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is introduced early, structures the entire middle (whirling silence descends, water flows upward, Elara's ascent), and provides urgency. The inversion's end ("When gravity righted itself") marks the closure boundary. The timeframe shapes tactics and atmosphere throughout. However, no on-page clock tightens decisions—Elara does not race the hour or face consequences if it expires. All three gates met with strong development; lack of ticking pressure caps it below 7.5. High 6s for coherent structural use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find the source of resilience"—is stated early and pursued in every beat. The climax fulfills it (she discovers and activates the source). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested: no competing desire, no cost to the search, no moment where she questions or sacrifices. It drives plot but not internal pressure. Setup, development, and payoff present; lack of friction or tradeoff keeps it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" is introduced early and repeated across beats (descends, intensified, broke into a symphony). It modulates from oppressive quiet to sensory crescendo, supporting the inversion's mystery. However, the tone does not evolve under pressure—it remains a static atmospheric effect rather than a dynamic charge. The final mention ("the quiet after the inversion") returns to baseline without reweighting. Functional and consistent but not transformative. Mid-5s for coherent but replaceable tone work.</comment>
