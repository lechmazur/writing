<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elm's interior life is presented through abstracted perception ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") rather than concrete contradiction or embodied struggle. His motivation—"to discover the shape of intentions"—remains asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final "tenderly organized around this new knowledge" reads as summary epiphany without the on-page cost or foreclosed path that would anchor a meaningful change. Micro-choices (tracing threads, noting colors) occur but do not reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elm, cemetery, silo) arrive clearly. The closure unit—Elm's realization that the tapestry is a reconciliatory artifact—registers as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the cemetery's past. However, the cost remains abstract ("resonance," "quiet purpose") rather than a specific forfeiture or reweighted tactic visible in the final image. The "after the chess clock ran down" refrain functions as a time marker but does not tighten options. One meaningful deepening is present (dark thread → founder plot twist), meeting minimum sufficiency but not high-band cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, stars, and tapestry are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dust motes, starlight, frayed threads). The silo's "cool and still" air and the cemetery's "velveteen gloom" create coherent atmosphere. The tapestry functions as micro-setting, constraining Elm's method (decoding threads) and charging the final image when he rolls it back into the case. Spatial choreography is clean. This meets the 9+ gate requirement (object constrains choice and charges ending), but the silo itself remains more backdrop than active constraint on tactics, holding the score in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the hidden tapestry's purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when the black thread reveals "a plot against the town's founder," deepening the mystery. The resolution—realizing the tapestry is reconciliatory—arises from Elm's decoding work but lacks visible cost or a live tradeoff that narrows his later options. The "uncharted echoes now had a chart" line summarizes consequence rather than showing a foreclosed path or altered tactic. Agency is present (he decides to decode, then to return the case) but pressure does not escalate sufficiently to enter the 7+ band, where a felt price is expected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—care for the forgotten, reconciliation across time—emerges organically from the tapestry's coded burial rites and the sovereign case's reconciliatory purpose. The final image (Elm rolling the tapestry back, whispering thanks) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "the shape of intentions" and "the world made a little more sense, stitched with care" edge toward abstraction. The recurring "tenderly organized" and "uncharted echoes" motifs are purposeful but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure across beats; they function more as texture than as thematic levers that reweight the stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is present ("velveteen gloom," "whispers of blue, gold, and crimson") but leans into elevated register that occasionally feels authorial rather than character-particular. Phrases like "a plea for peace" and "silent symphony" suggest a consistent lyric voice, yet the diction does not degrade or shift under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") are frequent but not egregious. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains focalization, meeting baseline competence but lacking the rhythmic compression or embodied perception that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence drag momentum: "tenderly organized" appears four times, "uncharted echoes" three times, "after the chess clock ran down" twice, "velveteen gloom" twice. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure ("He untangled not just threads, but the silent histories"; "The method revealed that each border knot represented a life's unspoken design"). Stock metaphors ("silent symphony," "frozen in time") and elevated diction ("reconciliatory artifact") clash with the gardener's presumed lexicon. Information density is low; many lines perform atmosphere without advancing cause/effect. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, template stems, register drift) yields a baseline deduction of −1.2 in Q7, with loops touching the closure paragraph adding −0.3 for a total of approximately −1.5 from a mid-6 anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—cemetery gardener discovers a coded tapestry in a silo—offers mild novelty, but the emotional arc (ignorance → decoding → quiet revelation) follows a familiar mystery-to-epiphany template. The tapestry's reconciliatory purpose and the founder's forgiven debts are earnest but not surprising. Specificity is present (cobalt silo, frayed threads, yew tree poet) yet many details (chess clock, stars, mossy stones) function as atmosphere rather than irreplaceable causal levers. The piece does not take bold structural or tonal risks; it opts for a safe, meditative register throughout. Transformation test: the core plot and resolution could transfer to another setting with minimal alteration, signaling insufficient freshness for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elm is present throughout and makes decisions (to enter the silo, decode the threads, return the case), meeting setup and middle development. His choices drive the narrative beats. However, his "blithe" nature is mentioned early but does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost; it fades into generic focus. At closure, his decision to return the case and continue gardening with new insight is earned but lacks a sharp tradeoff or foreclosed path. Beat involvement: three (entry, decoding, closure). Causal pressure: moderate. Closure linkage: present. Swappability: a different caretaker role could substitute with minor edits. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +0.7 closure, −0.5 swappability, −0.3 label-only "blithe" yields ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case is introduced in the silo (setup), opened to reveal the tapestry (middle), and returned to the silo at closure (payoff), meeting all three gates. It appears in three beats and is handled on the page. Its history (founder's token of forgiven debts) reweights the tapestry's meaning. However, the case itself is a container rather than an active constraint on Elm's decoding method; the tapestry does the causal work. Removing the case and placing the tapestry on the crate directly would preserve the core arc. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +0.9 closure, +0.5 causal, −0.6 swappability yields ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is mentioned five times, framing the piece's atmosphere and reappearing at closure ("the uncharted echoes now had a chart"). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is implicit (the echoes are what Elm decodes). However, it functions primarily as a metaphor for forgotten histories rather than a concrete constraint that narrows options or alters tactics. Its presence is thematic and textural, not causal. The element could be replaced with "hidden stories" or "silent voices" without structural change. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure, −0.7 swappability, −0.5 ornamental yields ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears four times: describing Elm's work (setup), the tapestry's threads (middle), his heart (closure). It characterizes Elm's approach but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; he never faces a moment where his meticulousness creates a tradeoff or enables a breakthrough that disorder would prevent. The attribute is label-only and could be replaced with "methodical" or "careful." Setup and payoff met; middle development weak. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure, −0.8 label-only, −0.5 swappability yields ~4.6 (late intro after 40% does not apply; it appears early).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled early ("he must untangle the mystery"), executed across multiple beats (decoding threads, tracing symbols, unraveling the final knot), and named at closure ("he had untangled the frayed edges of history"). It drives Elm's method and structures the escalation from general mystery to specific revelation. The action is specific to this story's mechanics (frayed threads) and irreplaceable; "decode" alone would not capture the physical, tactile dimension. All three gates met. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +1.2 closure, +1.0 causal, +0.6 specificity yields ~7.3 (no −0.3 for summary-only; the action is on-page). This is the element most tightly woven into the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—is introduced when Elm examines the tapestry, executed across the middle (tracing threads, noting colors, following silver and gold strands to specific graves), and referenced at closure ("decoding intentions woven long ago"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The method is specific and its mechanics matter (each thread corresponds to a grave). However, the mechanics themselves are not visibly constrained or tested; Elm succeeds without setback or trade-off. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +1.0 closure, +0.8 causal, +0.5 specificity, −0.4 no cost tied to method yields ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "cobalt silo under stars" is introduced early (setup), houses the tapestry discovery and decoding (middle), and is named at closure ("the cobalt silo stood as a testament"). It appears in at least three beats and provides the physical space for Elm's work. The silo's "cool and still" air and isolation amplify mood. However, it does not constrain Elm's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it is a container rather than an active pressure. The stars mark time but do not tighten decisions. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +0.7 closure, −0.6 postcard/static yields ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the chess clock ran down" is mentioned three times, anchoring the time of Elm's silo visit and recurring as a refrain. It meets setup and payoff but does not function as a live constraint; the phrase is retrospective flavor rather than a ticking pressure that alters Elm's tactics. The piece notes "time felt suspended" and "the stars wheeled, marking hours," but elapsed time does not tighten decisions. The clock reference is swappable with "after sunset" or "after the match ended." Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure, −0.7 swappability, −0.5 vague/untracked, −0.3 ornamental yields ~3.8 (cap at 4.6 for missing middle development does not lower further).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elm's motivation—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is stated early (setup), drives his decoding work (middle), and is referenced at closure ("the shape of intentions like a familiar soil"). It shapes his goal across beats. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or friction between want and cost; Elm's path is smooth and unopposed. No moment where curiosity conflicts with, say, respect for the dead or fear of what he'll find. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 beats, +0.9 closure, +0.6 causal, −0.8 told-only, −0.4 no friction yields ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears in the opening, recurs twice in the middle, and returns at closure ("the velveteen gloom remained, but it was softer"). It establishes a consistent tone—melancholic, textured, enveloping—that modulates slightly at the end (lifting, softening). The tone does not shift dramatically under pressure but maintains coherence and charges the final image with a sense of understood sorrow. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6 band. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 closure reprise with reweighting, −0.3 static mood through middle yields ~6.3.</comment>
