<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her use of the lens to discover the honeycomb shows agency, but the internal life remains thin—her "rosewater dread" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The leap from seeing the pattern to understanding "the arts aren't dying from cold, but from starvation" feels like an authorial gift rather than earned insight rooted in her historian's training. The final choice (scattering bread) works causally but lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; she simply succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph, and the piece follows a clear causal chain: lens reveals honeycomb → journal confirms scent-of-home solution → bread ritual completes the thaw. The closure is a Decisive Change with the ice shattering and bees awakening, but the cost remains abstract—what path does Elara foreclose, what does she lose? The final image of teaching the custom forward supplies thematic resonance but the on-page price at the pivotal beat is invisible, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly rendered with the creeping ice, central pool, and relic room all shaping Elara's search and solution. The emerald lens filters light to reveal the honeycomb, a micro-setting use that charges the discovery beat. Spatial choreography across the grotto, relic room, and home remains clear. The setting constrains Elara's options (the freeze silences looms/forges) and the pool's transformation supplies the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for environment shaping the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescue dying arts before final freeze—is signaled early and tightens when the silent concert fails, forcing Elara to recall the bread. That micro-reversal narrows her options and the ice shattering provides a meaningful turn. However, the escalation feels more procedural than agonized; Elara's agency drives the solution but no visible tradeoff or cost accompanies the thaw, and coincidence (the bread just happened to bake that morning) assists rather than complicates. One tightening is present but lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the honeycomb pattern, the scent-of-home ritual, and the final vow to teach the custom, but the resolution veers toward overt statement: "the sharp, sweet responsibility of memory—the rosewater note now in a tonic of hope." The piece invites reflection on cultural continuity, yet the ending's pedagogical declaration ("She would teach them all") leans instructive rather than resonant. The bread and lens reweight prior material but the final paragraph edges into thematic summary rather than letting the image carry the meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's historian lens colors her observations ("a sentence," "historical fact," "their living culture"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from tight interiority to wider observation. The phrase "rosewater dread—a sweet, fragrant anxiety" reads slightly over-articulated for a crisis moment, and the final reflection's elevated register ("tonic of hope") wobbles slightly from her established idiom under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Diction remains mostly character-bound with minor slips into authorial phrasing at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance plot or atmosphere, but several runs open with template stems: "She rushed," "She ran," "She sprinted," creating minor cadence monotony in the urgency sequence. Figurative density is high ("rosewater dread," "sentence," "scent of home," "tonic of hope") without always adding causal information, occasionally stalling momentum. "The thaw had to be literal" tells what the prior beat showed. Clarity remains high and no major loops appear, but the accumulation of decorative phrasing and repeated action stems lowers propulsion in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of museum guide, opera glass, bread ritual, and frozen hive offers specificity, but the underlying template—lost culture revived by ritual object—is familiar and the piece follows expected beats without surprising turns. The bread-as-scent solution is set up but feels convenient; the morning baking coincides exactly with the moment of need. Elara's historian trait and the emerald lens provide fresh detail, yet the emotional arc and escalation pattern track a standard recovery quest without bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara guides tours, examines murals, reads the journal, and calls the artisans—her role as guide frames her knowledge base and her final vow to teach a new tour closes the arc. She makes two key decisions: realizing the pool is a hive and remembering the bread. The occupation enables these choices but does not constrain them with visible cost; she succeeds without professional tradeoff. Present in setup, middle action, and closure but replaceable with "historian" or "archivist" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opera glass lens appears in three beats: examining murals (where painted bees shimmer), peering at the iced pool (revealing the honeycomb), and watching the pattern pulse during the thaw. Its emerald tint filters blue gloom to gold, a specific optical mechanic that enables the discovery. The family heirloom backstory seeds it early and the final pulse ties it to closure. Removing it would require a different detection method, but the thaw itself hinges on the bread, not the lens, so the lens is essential to diagnosis but not resolution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Displaced persons frames the grotto's history and Elara's motivation, appearing in the opening and reprised at the restoration: "The displaced persons of the grotto felt a shift." It shapes the why (sanctuary failing) but does not constrain tactics; the freeze and hive mechanics drive the plot. The concept charges theme and stakes but remains largely atmospheric rather than forcing specific on-page choices. Present in setup and ending but functions more as context than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's historically oriented nature is stated and colors her voice ("historical fact," "historically oriented mind already drafting the new tour"), but it does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. She examines murals and reads the journal—actions any careful observer might take. The trait enriches voice and plausibility but does not create a tradeoff or alternative path; removing it would soften characterization without breaking causality. Label-present, functionally soft.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The thaw is the story's climax: ice shatters, bees awaken, creeping ice recedes, warmth returns. Every prior beat builds toward it (lens discovery, journal clue, failed concert, bread scattering) and the resolution depends on it occurring. The thaw redefines the grotto's fate and closes Elara's arc. Swapping "thaw" for another resolution would require rewriting premise and mechanics. Strongly causal, present in setup (freeze described), middle (as goal), and closure (enacted), with clear consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bread custom is introduced early (grandmother's 'E' loaves, "scent of home"), enacted mid-story (Elara bakes her morning bread), and supplies the climactic solution (scattering pieces onto ice). The journal clue "scent of home" primes it, and the warm grain scent mixed with crafted beauty triggers the thaw. Removing the custom would break the resolution logic. Present in three beats, causally active, and irreplaceable. The coincidence that she baked that morning slightly weakens necessity but the custom itself drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto city pressures every choice: waterfall veils the haven, ice creeps up walls silencing looms/forges, the central pool holds the frozen hive, the relic room supplies the journal. Spatial choreography (guide routes through grotto, relic room, home, back to pool) remains clear and each location enables a beat. The pool's transformation provides the closure image. The setting is not postcard description but active terrain that constrains search and supplies resources. Essential across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" anchors backstory and explains the freeze's onset, but no live ticking clock pressures Elara's moves. The "final freeze" is declared imminent but never quantified or tested; Elara proceeds at a steady pace without time forcing tradeoffs. The timeframe provides context but does not alter tactics or narrow her window. Present in setup, absent from middle pressure, ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—rescue dying arts—is stated early, drives her search (examining murals, reading journal, rallying artisans), and is affirmed at closure when she vows to teach the custom. The motivation is told clearly but dramatized lightly; no scene shows her torn between rescuing arts and another want or forced to sacrifice something dear. The concert failure creates momentary despair but the bread solution arrives without foreclosing an alternative path. Functional and consistent but friction between want and cost is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread—a sweet, fragrant anxiety" is named twice and colors the opening gloom and the moment of failure ("thickened, a cloying perfume of despair"). At closure it transforms into "the sharp, sweet responsibility of memory—the rosewater note now in a tonic of hope." The tone modulates with pressure but the final reconfiguration is told rather than embodied through image or action. The phrase charges theme but does not fully integrate with sentence rhythm or perceptual texture under stress. Purposeful reprise, moderate charge.</comment>
