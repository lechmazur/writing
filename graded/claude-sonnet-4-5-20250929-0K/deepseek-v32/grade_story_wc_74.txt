<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested through contradictory impulses or on-page struggle. The "methodically hopeful" trait remains a label; we see no moment where hope costs her something tangible or where doubt threatens her project. The night watchman and nurse receive memories passively—no agency, no choice that alters their state with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrases like "extinct kindness" and "methodical hope" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by first paragraph). The closure—strangers glimpsing the canvas and remembering kindness—occurs on the page, but the cost is entirely absent: Elara watches "from the shadows" without risking sleep, materials, discovery, or any foreclosed path. The daydream mechanism is asserted ("she slipped into a daydream") but never earns causal weight; the brush "seemed to guide her hand" is passive coincidence. Under a Causal lens (the piece gestures toward because/therefore), the strangers' epiphanies arrive via moonlight magic, not protagonist agency or prior sacrifice, deflating the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and waxing moon are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (humid air, night-blooming jasmine, atmospheric haze). The setting pressures the stake by providing isolation and moonlight, and the canvas against the greenhouse wall is a spatial choice that enables the ending. Micro-setting (the velvet cloth, workbench clutter) adds texture without wandering into catalog mode. The moon and smog recur at closure, reweighting the "saffron quiet" image, which lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early but never tightens or narrows options. Elara paints without obstacle, the brush cooperates, moonlight arrives on cue, and strangers instantly respond with warm daydreams. No reversal, no cost, no tradeoff: she advances her project, succeeds, and watches confirmation unfold. The piece lacks any on-page moment where agency forecloses a path or a live choice raises the price. The ending grants symmetric satisfaction without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—kindness echoes in memory—emerges from images (Babylonian merchant, scribe teaching letters) rather than moralizing, and the "lost languages as vessels of extinct kindness" is a specific angle. Yet the final paragraph nearly sermonizes: "her methodical hope was fulfilled. Strangers, indeed, remembered." The piece resists full statement but tilts close. The thematic question is posed early and the ending offers a resonant answer (the glowing canvas sparking individual reveries), but the lack of on-page cost or complication keeps the answer tidy rather than ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent and voice carries a distinct lexicon ("saffron quiet," "methodically hopeful"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure: tighter syntax during painting, broader rhythm during daydream sequences. No dialogue, so voice distinction is single-thread. Diction occasionally drifts high ("archaic scripts," "humane gestures") but remains within an educated painter's lexicon. No head-hopping, no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no algorithmic monotony. Information density is moderate—many lines do one job (describe, advance action, or state theme) rather than layering. Mild paraphrase loops: "lost languages" recurs with near-synonym expansions ("vessels of extinct kindness," "forgotten words for compassion," "records of humane gestures") across adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the daydream sequence: "She saw…Another stroke brought…" Clarity is high; no grammar slips. The final line ("Strangers, indeed, remembered") reads as scaffold summary rather than image. Deduct −0.6 for loop/template artifacts; no closure-beat muddle, so cap at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—painter uses moon-tipped brush to awaken kindness via lost languages—combines familiar wish-fulfillment and symbolic convenience. The brush is a gift from a wandering monk (stock origin), the moonlight magic resolves without friction, and the ending delivers unearned epiphany to strangers who happen to glance up. Transformation test fails: swap "lost languages" for "forgotten songs" or "ancient symbols" and the arc is unchanged. No bold risk, no complication of the core optimism. The "saffron quiet" coinage offers a flicker of freshness, but the story retreats to the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes one on-page action (painting the canvas, placing it against the wall), but her choices do not create key turns—moonlight and the brush's magic do the work. She observes the strangers' reactions without altering tactics. Functional but replaceable; any mystic artist could execute the same moves. Setup ✓, middle ✓ (painting), closure ✓ (watching). Two-gate minimum met, but causal pressure is low and swappability is high. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.3 + two beats +0.9 − swappability −0.6 − summary closure −0.4 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears early (velvet cloth, "captured luminescence"), is dipped in ink and used to paint mid-story, and is "laid beside" the canvas at closure where it "pulsed softly." Three beats, but the brush's mechanics are vague ("seemed to guide her hand") and the closure pulse is ornamental—it doesn't alter the outcome. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +0.7 − ornamental use −0.5 − vague mechanics −0.3 = 5.8. Specificity is moderate; irreplaceability unclear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lost languages" frame the obsession early, appear as painted symbols mid-story, and are echoed at closure ("silent chorus of historical kindness"). They shape the canvas's content but do not constrain Elara's tactics or narrow her options—she paints whatever the brush guides. The concept is thematic decoration rather than plot engine. Setup ✓, middle ✓ (symbols), closure ✓ (reprise). Base ~3.0 + setup +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + closure +0.5 − ornamental −0.6 − swappable with "forgotten songs" −0.5 = 3.7, round down to 3.7. Slight upward nudge for specificity → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named twice ("methodically hopeful," "her hope a steady engine," "methodical hope was fulfilled") but never constrains an action or imposes visible cost. It describes her stance without altering what she does or trades off. No middle beat where the trait enables a risky choice or forecloses an option. Setup ✓ (label), middle ✗, closure ✓ (reprise). Two-gate cap → 6.0, but label-only use and zero causal pressure lower severely. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.3 − label-only −0.6 − no middle beat penalty per gate −1.0 − no cost −0.6 = 1.1, but lyric reprise lifts slightly to 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rouse" is the stated goal early, the painting-and-placement mid-story enacts it, and the strangers' daydreams at closure deliver the result. The action drives all three beats and the ending image depends on it. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.0 + causal pressure +0.8 − swappable with "inspire" or "awaken" −0.4 = 6.3. Irreplaceability moderate; the action is generic enough that synonyms work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Via daydreams sparked by moonlight" is described as "a technique the monk had vaguely described," appears in Elara's painting trance ("she slipped into a daydream"), and recurs when strangers "daydream suddenly" at closure. Three beats, but the mechanics remain vague and do not constrain her approach—she paints, moonlight happens, daydreams occur. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.4 + three beats +1.4 + closure +0.7 − vague mechanics −0.8 − no causal constraint −0.6 = 4.1, nudge up for thematic coherence → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is established in the opening, supplies moonlight through glass panes mid-story, and provides the clear wall where Elara places the canvas to rouse the strangers—spatial choreography that enables the ending. Setup ✓, middle ✓ (moonlight filter), closure ✓ (canvas against wall). Base ~3.0 + setup +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.2 + causal pressure (wall placement) +0.8 − swappable with "studio skylight" −0.3 = 6.7. The setting constrains and enables tactics; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Under a waxing moon's glow" appears in the opening, reappears when Elara paints ("the moon climbed higher"), and anchors the final image. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no clock, no deadline, no cost for delay. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.4 + three beats +1.4 + closure +0.5 − no tactical constraint −0.8 − vague/untracked time −0.6 = 3.9, lyric reprise lifts slightly → 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To prove that strangers remember kindness" is stated early ("her motivation was singular"), drives the painting project mid-story, and is confirmed at closure ("strangers, indeed, remembered"). The motivation is declared but never conflicted—no cost, no competing want, no friction between desire and obstacle. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + closure +0.8 − told-only, no friction −1.0 − no visible cost −0.6 − label fulfillment −0.7 = 3.4, round to 3.4. Lyric coherence nudges to 4.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" is introduced early ("a term she used for the warm, hushed peace"), recurs mid-story ("in the saffron quiet"), and frames the final waiting beat. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (shifts from isolation to shared recognition), charging the final image with warmth. Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Base ~3.0 + setup +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +0.9 + tone modulation +0.5 − coined phrase feels decorative −0.4 − static mood, minimal pressure shift −0.7 = 5.3.</comment>
