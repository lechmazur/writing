<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness is established but remains largely ornamental; her methodical working style is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The awakening of empathy at the quarry ("Suddenly, the victim was no longer a puzzle but a person") reads as a declared epiphany rather than one earned through embodied struggle. The journal provides convenient access to the victim's interiority, flattening the challenge her condition should impose. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves smoothly from detachment to connection without visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN adequately (face-blind artist, studio then quarry, after evidence vanishes) and attempts a causal-accumulative hybrid lens. The discovery of the box ("misplaced in plain sight") provides a turn, but the linkage is weak: why wasn't the crevice searched in a decade, and why does Elara's visual scan succeed where prior searches failed when her face-blindness should impair spatial detail work? The closure gesture—drawing "a portrait of a life, infused with newfound empathy"—offers emotional reconfiguration but the cost (what path is foreclosed?) remains abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs but causal gaps dilute closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly rendered ("bowl of silence," "tangles of mist," "shadows pooled deep") and its geology (crevice, limestone cliffs) supplies the hiding place for evidence, meeting the micro-setting standard. Sensory detail is consistent but leans visual, which clashes with Elara's impairment; taste, tactile temperature, and acoustic resonance could better anchor her perception. The ribbon fragment's silk texture and crimson stain are noted but not used to constrain a choice. Spatial choreography (studio to quarry edge to steep path to crevice) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the cold case and awakening empathy—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elara goes to the quarry, sits, visualizes, climbs, finds the box in a single uncontested sequence. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the discovery is presented as insight ("a sudden insight") rather than a decision under pressure. The cost of empathy awakening is told ("awaken painfully") not shown through a trade-off or foreclosed alternative. Coincidence (the box survived a decade in a crevice) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "unifying opposites" motif (elegance/violence, nature/industry, logic/feeling) is overtly stated multiple times, reducing subtext to thesis. The ribbon as masquerade clue and the quarry as dual symbol are purposeful, but the final-paragraph summary ("she had found humanity") and the explain-everything coda ("learned to see with the heart") flatten thematic resonance into a stated moral. The victim's journal provides emotional access, yet the moment of empathy remains abstract rather than dramatized. The piece gestures toward complexity (the killer's motive "hidden in masquerade") but does not develop moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("suffocating mystery," "lance the boil," "furrowed hush") that feels imposed rather than character-specific for a working artist. Elara's perceptual signature—faces as "shifting mosaics"—is noted early but not sustained; her quarry observations remain visually detailed despite her impairment. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks textural distinctness; syntax and rhythm do not modulate meaningfully under pressure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Phrasing loops appear: "methodical" recurs five times, "ribbon fragment" four times, "unifying opposites" three times, creating synonym churn without added nuance. Several lines restate content without advancing pressure: "The ribbon was silk, yet stained" is immediately glossed as "elegance and violence." Template cadence emerges in the closure paragraphs with repeated "she had found" and "The cold case would close now" summary. Stock metaphors ("lance the boil," "pierce the case") and filter-verb stacks ("she told herself," "she realized," "she saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; many sentences do single jobs. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise is fresh, but the story retreats into familiar cold-case mystery beats: withheld evidence, a lone investigator, a climactic discovery in a previously searched location. The "unifying opposites" method is asserted but not demonstrated through a specific technique unique to Elara's craft. The quarry location and masquerade motif are competently chosen but feel selected from a checklist rather than synthesized into an inevitable whole. Emotional specificity is limited; the empathy arc follows a predictable trajectory from detachment to connection. Transformation test: the plot and arc function unchanged with a non-face-blind detective and different symbolic objects.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness is present in setup (first paragraph) and noted at closure (locket scene), meeting two gates. However, it does not constrain her key choice—climbing to the crevice—or enable her discovery in a way tied to the condition. The impairment is mentioned but her visual scanning and spatial deduction function normally, making the trait swappable with another backstory detail. Late arrival (−0.0, present early) but ornamental use (−0.6) and swappability (−0.5) lower the score. Closure participation is passive observation rather than causal action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in setup (opening line), development (Elara deduces mask details from it), and closure (drawer mention), meeting all three gates. It enables her deduction of the perpetrator's mask and height, shaping one turn. However, the fragment is not physically handled after the opening; its properties (silk, crimson, stained) are described but do not constrain a later choice or reweight meaning at the ending—the drawer line is a static reprise. Two-beat involvement (+0.9), early signal (+0.5), but swappable with another torn garment (−0.5) and no closure charge (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cold case is present in setup (file, decade-old mystery), shapes the dominant stake, and drives Elara to the quarry. It constrains her tactics (no physical evidence, must use verbal descriptions and location) and participates in closure (the case will close). Three gates met. However, "cold case" is a genre frame more than a specific story mechanic; the evidence-vanishing twist (Timeframe H) does more tactical work. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.9), but swappable with "missing person" or "unsolved crime" (−0.5), and the concept's specificity is generic (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is asserted five times but constrains only one action: sitting to visualize systematically. The trait does not create visible cost or tradeoff—Elara's methodical approach succeeds without friction or error. Setup present (first paragraph), development weak (no choice hinges on method versus intuition), closure absent (the final portrait integrates "logic and feeling" but this is told, not shown through a cost tied to her methodology). Early signal (+0.5), one beat involvement (+0.4), but label-only (−0.5), no cost (−0.4), and swappable with "careful" or "systematic" (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice in metaphorical usage ("lance the suffocating mystery open," "lanced the boil of unresolved grief") but is not dramatized as a physical or decisive action that turns the plot. The actual turn is the discovery and climb, not a lancing gesture. The metaphor is ornamental rather than causal. Setup absent (metaphor introduced mid-story), development weak (no action hinges on piercing/opening), closure present only as summary language. Late first appearance (−0.4), ornamental (−0.8), swappable with "solve" or "crack" (−0.6), summary-only (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is stated three times and labeled as Elara's method, but the mechanics are never demonstrated—how does she unify concrete detail with intuitive leap in practice? The final synthesis (elegant mask/violent act, cold case/fresh insight) is summarized rather than shown through a specific technique. Setup weak (first stated at paragraph 14, past midpoint), development thin (the quarry insight is assertion, not shown unification), closure present (final paragraph restates it). Late arrival (−0.5), ornamental (−0.7), label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quarry is present in setup (mentioned by detective), development (Elara's journey and search), and closure (descending as mist lifts). It supplies the hiding place (crevice) that enables the discovery, constraining her search and providing the key resource. The mist and cliffs are vividly rendered and the "bowl of silence" charges the atmosphere. Three gates met. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (hiding place) (+1.0), closure linkage (mist lifting as she descends) (+1.0), specificity (limestone cliffs, crevice) (+0.5). No major frictions; the setting does essential work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is stated twice and frames the urgency (Elara is now the last resort), meeting setup. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics during the story—Elara's quarry visit is leisurely (sitting, visualizing, climbing) with no clock pressure or deadline. Closure absent (the ending does not hinge on time running out or the vanishing creating a cost). Early signal (+0.6), one beat involvement (framing urgency) (+0.4), but no mid-story constraint (−0.5), no closure participation (−0.6), and swappable with "case is stalled" (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The desire "to awaken dormant empathy" is stated in setup ("a deeper need … stirred uneasily") and closure ("empathy … awaken painfully"), meeting two gates. It shapes the dominant stake alongside solving the case. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Elara does not face a decision between detachment and connection with visible cost. The journal provides convenient access to the victim's humanity, flattening the challenge. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (shapes her arc) (+0.7), but told-only (−0.6), no friction between want and cost (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears once in the quarry description and the atmosphere of muted tension (mist, silence, shadows) is sustained through the discovery sequence. Tone modulates slightly as mist lifts at closure, suggesting clarification. However, "furrowed" is an unusual adjective for silence and borders on mixed metaphor; the tone remains consistently somber without meaningful pressure-driven shift. Setup present (quarry scene), development sustained (silence and mist throughout search), closure present (mist lifts). Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but static mood through turns (−0.4), mixed metaphor (−0.3).</comment>
