<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is specific ("to discover what mirrors don't show") and her druid attribute ("finds lost things") drives the action, but her internal conflict is thin—she moves through the vortex with more metaphysical certainty than genuine struggle. The decision to feed the Blightseed the "frozen confession" reads ingenious but arrives without prior doubt or cost that would make it feel earned through character contradiction. Embodied emotion is present (the "hurricane of sorrow and rage") but briefly stated rather than sustained through micro-choices under pressure. The warlike serenity flattens into competence without visible blind spots or mistakes that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal: the failed ritual → eruption → vortex entry → discovery of naiad/Blightseed → destruction of seed → lake calms. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change (vortex collapses, naiad recovers, lake stills) with visible cost (Elara absorbs the naiad's agony and lets the seed bite her palm), and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara reaches the vortex eye and discovers the planted Blightseed, narrowing her task from calming the lake to excising a specific malice. Minor gap: the mechanism by which feeding the seed "the naiad's frozen confession" destroys it feels asserted more than causally prepared, but the closure lands on the page with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "swirling orchard vortex" is vivid and specific: "ancient apple and pear trees whirling in a monstrous liquid column, their branches snapping like bone." Spatial choreography is coherent (outer rim → expanding circles → central eye → ice pillar). The ice pillar constrains Elara's choice (she must press hands to ice, not melt it) and the Blightseed's location at the naiad's feet charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through urgency. The body as micro-setting (Elara's palm accepting the seed's bite) charges the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: calm the Crying Lake by finding its lost spirit. The inciting failure (ritual fails, vortex erupts) raises immediate cost. One clear tightening: discovering the Blightseed shifts the task from soothing to excising a planted weapon. Elara's agency drives escalation (she enters the vortex, unbends the spiral, feeds the seed the confession) and the cost is visible on the page (agony of absorbing the naiad's essence, seed roots biting her palm). The resolution is earned by her action with felt price. Minor limitation: the middle spiral journey compresses multiple violent rings into summary ("each concentric ring of current more violent than the last") without dramatizing a failed attempt or intermediate loss that would deepen the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: surface truth versus hidden wound, the inadequacy of illusion when confronting planted malice. The "frozen confession" motif recurs with shifted meaning (ice as truth-holder, then as vessel for the toxic truth fed to the seed). The final image—Elara standing on calm water, knowing what lies beneath—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what mirrors don't show" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the final paragraph. The Blightseed consuming its own caused truth is a concrete particular that charges the conceptual question. Minor gap: "warlike serenity" is declared but not fully embodied in Elara's interiority, reading more as authorial assertion than emergent character state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (e.g., "It was agony, a hurricane of sorrow and rage"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices essences, roots, spirits—druid-specific filtering. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon except for one register slip: "warlike serenity" and "guarded druid's attribute" read more like narrative glossing than her interior voice. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the spiral sequence ("expanding circles… each concentric ring") is legible and supports momentum. Filter verbs ("felt the failure," "found it") are acceptable and voice-motivated. Minor tic: "the lake's naiad" and "the naiad's frozen confession" repeat a possessive-noun template within close lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at closure: "The ice shattered. The vortex… collapsed"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One template-cadence run: "She entered… She moved… She did not swim… she let it carry…" uses parallel "She [verb]" stems across four sentences in the third paragraph, triggering a −0.4 baseline penalty. Figurative language is vivid and controlled ("branches snapping like bone," "a hurricane of sorrow and rage") without overwriting. The phrase "warlike serenity" is poetic but borderline stock; it recurs without incremental charge. Minor passive: "was the frozen confession" could be tightened. Proofreading is clean; no grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—finding a lost essence within a vortex—transforms the "calm the cursed lake" trope through the specific twist of a planted Blightseed and a frozen naiad. The method of feeding the seed its own caused truth is fresh and hinges on prior particulars (the seed's hunger, the confession's purity). "Warlike serenity" as declared tone and "what mirrors don't show" as motivation are evocative but border on familiar fantasy idiom. The "expanding circles" method and the druid's "finds lost things" attribute integrate tightly, showing synthesis rather than novelty for its own sake. No close echoes of famous lines detected. Risk is modest: the structure and emotional arc follow a clear heroic-descent template with one clever inversion at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is present from the opening and makes the key decisions: enters the vortex, moves through expanding circles, connects to the naiad, feeds the seed the confession. Her "guarded druid's attribute" (finds lost things) enables the central action. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle spiral, closure destruction of the seed). Two distinct beats driven by her choice: entering the vortex despite danger, pressing hands to ice to draw out the naiad's essence. Causal pressure: her decision to feed the seed the confession (not her flesh) destroys it and collapses the vortex. Closure linkage strong: she cradles the recovering naiad spark in the final image. Cost visible: absorbing the naiad's agony, letting the seed bite her palm. Early signal, beat involvement (3+), causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost all present. Minor friction: her internal contradiction is thin; the spiral journey compresses her struggle into summary. Aggregating positives (~+3.5) and applying small friction for limited interiority (~−0.3), score lands ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Blightseed appears in setup (discovered in the ice at the naiad's feet), development (Elara reaches for it, it attaches to her palm), and closure (she feeds it the confession, it crumbles, the vortex collapses). Three distinct beats: discovery, attachment, destruction. Causal pressure: the seed's presence explains the vortex and the ritual's failure; its destruction resolves the conflict. Closure linkage undeniable: "It convulsed, blackened, and crumbled to ash. The ice shattered. The vortex… collapsed." Cost connection: Elara lets it bite her palm, risking her vitality. Specificity: its unique property (consumes vitality but cannot consume pure toxic truth) is irreplaceable. Early signal, beat involvement (3), causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and cost all present. Aggregating positives (~+5.0), no major frictions, score lands ~8.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Frozen confession" is the ice pillar holding the naiad in shock, revealing the betrayal—a planted Blightseed rather than natural decay. It appears in setup (the naiad "frozen in a posture of shock and betrayal"), development (Elara presses hands to the ice to connect), and closure (she feeds the seed "the naiad's frozen confession, the entire, terrible truth"). Two beats: discovery reframes the task, feeding the confession destroys the seed. Causal pressure: the confession's purity is toxic to the seed, enabling resolution. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate: the concept hinges on ice-as-truth-holder and truth-as-weapon, which is fresh but abstract. Cost tied indirectly: Elara absorbs the confession's agony. Early signal, beat involvement (2), causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Aggregating positives (~+3.8), small friction for abstraction (~−0.2), score lands ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is stated early: "Elara had the guarded druid's attribute: she found lost things. Not keys or sheep, but lost essences, forgotten magics, buried truths." It enables the central action: finding the naiad's lost essence within the ice. Two beats: the attribute frames her entry into the vortex ("she would find it or die trying") and her success at the eye ("she found the lost, screaming essence of the naiad"). Causal pressure moderate: the trait justifies her confidence but does not visibly constrain or impose cost—she succeeds without a dramatized tradeoff or failed attempt that tests the attribute's limits. Closure linkage present: the final line echoes "she had found the lost thing." Early signal and beat involvement (2) present. No visible cost tied to the attribute itself (e.g., a price for finding, a boundary she must cross). Aggregating positives (~+2.0) and applying friction for label-only cost (~−0.5), score lands ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears as method and metaphor: "To unbend the vortex, she had to understand its core bend" and "had unbent the cursed spiral." The action shapes one key turn: understanding the vortex's bend (the Blightseed at its heart) reframes the task from calming to excising. Closure linkage: the final line credits her with having "unbent the cursed spiral." Causal role: the concept guides her tactic (find the core, remove the poison) but is not irreplaceable—other verbs (e.g., "heal," "cleanse") could substitute with minor edits. Early signal present. One beat where it constrains choice (middle discovery). Moderate specificity: "unbend" is apt for a vortex but not unique. Aggregating positives (~+2.0) and applying swappability friction (~−0.5), score lands ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles" is signaled: "Elara moved through expanding circles, starting at the chaotic outer rim and fighting inward, each concentric ring of current more violent than the last." The method appears in one extended beat (the spiral journey) and is mentioned at closure ("unbent the cursed spiral"). Causal role: the method structures her approach but is compressed into summary—no dramatized attempt at each ring that would show the mechanics mattering. Closure linkage weak: the spiral is echoed but not causally active in the final image. Early signal present. One beat. Moderate specificity: the spiral path is apt for a vortex but easily replaced by "inward" or "deeper." Aggregating positives (~+1.5) and applying summary-only friction (~−0.4), score lands ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "swirling orchard vortex at the heart of a cursed lake" is the story's spatial crucible. Setup: vortex erupts in the opening. Development: Elara enters and fights through it, the vertical forest of whirling trees constrains her movement and creates danger. Closure: vortex collapses when the Blightseed is destroyed, trees settle their roots, lake stills. Three beats. Causal pressure: the vortex's structure (outer rim → eye) shapes her tactics; the central ice pillar holds the naiad and seed, enabling discovery. Closure linkage strong: "The vortex… collapsed… The trees… settled… The lake became still." Specificity high: orchard trees (apple, pear) and the liquid column are vivid and irreplaceable. Cost connection: the violent current and snapping branches embody physical danger. Early signal, beat involvement (3), causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present. Aggregating positives (~+4.5), no major frictions, score lands ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the opening: "The magic trick failed at dusk, and the world broke its promise." The timeframe sets up urgency (the vortex has just erupted, immediate crisis) but does not tighten decisions within the scene—no live clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices during the spiral journey or at the eye. The "after" frame is static: the entire action occurs in one continuous window without time-based escalation. Setup present, closure echo weak (time is not reweighted at the end). One beat: the failed ritual as inciting incident. Moderate causal role: the failure launches the plot but does not constrain later tactics. Aggregating positives (~+1.0) and applying static-time friction (~−0.5), score lands ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is stated early: "Her motivation was not to save the lake, but to discover what mirrors don't show." The motivation drives her entry into the vortex and frames the discovery: the ice (not the reflective water) reveals the betrayal. Setup and closure present: the final line echoes "The mirrors of the lake would now show only sky, but she knew what lay beneath." One beat: the motivation justifies her risk. Causal pressure moderate: the desire guides her but is not tested by conflicting wants or costs—she pursues it without friction. Specificity high: the mirror metaphor is apt and irreplaceable. Cost connection weak: no visible tradeoff dramatized on the page (e.g., renouncing safety or another goal to pursue this knowledge). Aggregating positives (~+2.5) and applying told-motivation friction (~−0.6), score lands ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is declared early: "Elara felt a warlike serenity settle over her." The tone is present in setup and echoed obliquely at closure ("the war within the serenity"). It modulates once: shifts from resolve at the shore to "agony, a hurricane of sorrow and rage" at the eye, then returns to calm at the end. One beat where tone shapes action: the serenity justifies her unflinching entry and her willingness to let the seed bite her. Causal role weak: the tone is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses or tactical choices. Closure linkage moderate: the tone recurs but does not decisively charge the final image. Specificity high: the phrase is evocative and apt. Aggregating positives (~+1.8) and applying static-mood friction (~−0.5), score lands ~5.7.</comment>
