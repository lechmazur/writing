<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear (hush the prophecy) and his method (mapping silence via the origami wing) is consistently pursued. However, interiority remains abstract and label-driven: "terrestrially cosmic pull," "dissonant vibration," "tranquil blaze of his purpose" tell rather than embody. No meaningful internal contradiction appears; the protagonist executes a ritual without friction, error, or cost that forecloses a live option. The final standing moment offers no visible renunciation or change earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the summoner's ritual gathers symbolic weight through repeated motifs (brook, wing, silence, ripples). Closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wing sinks, the prophecy is hushed, tranquility restored), but cost is asserted ("prophecy now a secret kept") rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, injury, or trade-off that reweights his options. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a visible price is paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and quiet brook are vividly rendered with fireflies, willow leaves, and ripples. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The origami wing functions as a tool that constrains the ritual's execution, appearing in multiple beats and charging the final image when it sinks. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a stage rather than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when "the prophecy resisting, its terrestrially cosmic essence straining," but this remains abstract and the summoner's will "flowing steadily" suggests no genuine obstacle or cost. No reversal narrows his options; the wing performs as intended, the prophecy is captured, and the brook carries it away. Agency is present but unchallenged; the ritual succeeds without visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the tension between cosmic disorder and earthly silence, the power of disciplined patience. The final image (wing dissolving, smoothed hush enveloping the world) offers a quiet answer without a stated moral. However, the thematic question is never tested by contradiction or cost on the page; the summoner's discipline faces no friction, so the resolution feels illustrated rather than earned. "Tranquil blaze" is asserted but not embodied in a choice that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") that is maintained throughout. However, diction trends toward stock fantasy phrasing ("nocturnal haven," "whispered secrets") and the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure, the prose remains uniform rather than tightening or fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies and rhythm supports the contemplative tone. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The prophecy's code was etched... a language of flickers and shadows" immediately followed by "With each passing moment, the summoner guided the wing, smoothing the hush over the turbulent secrets." Multiple sentences echo "amid whispered secrets" and "smoothed hush" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("low-hung stars," "tranquil blaze") and filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he extended his senses") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying Text Artifact penalties: −0.6 for loops and template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (summoner hushing a prophecy via origami and silence-mapping) offers a distinctive frame. However, the ritual unfolds without complication, transformation, or cost, making it feel more illustrative than dramatically necessary. The "terrestrially cosmic" motif and "tranquil blaze" oxymoron are present but not dramatized through conflict or choice. The story reads as a competent execution of a fantasy template (lone practitioner performs ritual, succeeds) without a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and his choices frame the ritual (placing the wing, guiding it, opening his eyes at the end). However, these are execution steps within a single uncontested plan rather than decisions that create turns or alter tactics under pressure. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present but passive. Mid-band functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears early, is handled in multiple beats (withdrawn, placed on water, glowing, dancing, folding into a sphere, sinking), and its dissolution shapes the ending. It evolves from tool to repository of the prophecy's code. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met with clear causal work. Strong integration; one step below indispensable because the mechanics are told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" recurs as a label throughout but functions as theme rather than stake-shaping concept. The summoner seeks to create it, but the narrative never dramatizes what cost or constraint "smoothing the hush" imposes. It is described (deepening, becoming tangible) but does not change his options or tactics on the page. Present and consistent, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears three times as a descriptor of the prophecy's nature and the summoner's task, but it remains a label without on-page constraint or cost. It tells us the prophecy threads earth and stars, yet no action or choice hinges on this dual nature. Mentioned, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Flow" is signaled early ("began to flow with the brook's gentle current," "flow of intent") and recurs ("flow continued"). The summoner's will and the brook's motion both "flow," bracketing the action. The final line reinforces it. However, major turns do not trace to "flow" as a mechanism; the wing's movements and the silence-mapping drive the ritual. Present across beats and ending, but swappable with "drift" or "current" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is stated as the summoner's discipline in the opening third. The wing charts "contours of silence" and traces "paths that only silence could follow." The method shapes the attempt and is present in the ending ("smoothed hush"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the mechanics are told rather than tested; no friction or cost arises from the mapping process itself. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is vividly described and anchors the ritual. The brook's current carries the wing and ultimately the dissolved sphere, affecting outcome. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resistance; it is a receptive stage. Setup and payoff gates are met; one causal beat (brook carrying the sphere away). Mid-band functional presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears as a phrase three times but functions as atmospheric modifier rather than timeframe. No clock or urgency tightens decisions; the ritual unfolds at the summoner's pace. Time does not constrain or alter tactics. Present as motif, absent as temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated early and drives every action: the summoner kneels, focuses, places the wing, guides it, and completes the task. The prophecy resists briefly, adding light friction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, no conflicting want or cost complicates the desire; the summoner pursues it without trade-off or renunciation. Causal role across beats; one step below essential due to lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced midway as a descriptor of the wing's glow and the summoner's purpose, then recurs in the penultimate paragraph. Tone is coherent (calm, contemplative) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. Late first appearance and ornamental use cap the score. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
