<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert") rather than embodied contradiction. The ritual at the lagoon operates more as symbolic performance than as a choice under pressure; no live option is foreclosed. The backstory about her father and her firefighter identity is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices. Emotional progression flattens into a single serene register without contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual gathers symbolic density (black sand, coin, scar) toward a thematic cadence. However, no on-page closure with felt cost lands; the final paragraph restates the premise ("scars can sing") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that narrows options or forecloses a path. The ending summarizes intent rather than delivering an image that reweights prior material with pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and dunes are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("granules like powdered night," "kelp-drift peace"). The ritual's physical staging—kneeling, sprinkling, applying paste—grounds the symbolic action in concrete gesture. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop. The coin and scar are handled on the page but do not limit options, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a live test. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the ritual proceeds without complication or cost. The protagonist's agency is limited to symbolic gesture; no decision forecloses a path or trades one value for another. Escalation is absent; the tone holds steady from opening to close without a meaningful deepening or pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (black sand, coin, scar) and the central metaphor of scars singing. Subtext operates in the coin's foreign script and the paste as ritual healing. However, the final paragraph shifts into overt moralizing ("The scars would sing, and she would be their witness"), stating the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy affirmation without ambiguity or earned cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual filter ("gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("unyielding compassion," "profound stillness," "potential song") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The narrator's perceptual signature is present but applied uniformly without modulation under pressure. Syntax varies purposefully, and no filter-verb stacks appear, but the overall texture reads more thematic than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled in most beats, but several lines loop conceptually: "The scars would sing" recurs without added pressure, and "gracefully alert" appears twice as a label. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("resilience," "silent symphony," "whispers") that dilute momentum. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" openings across the middle section. Information density is moderate; many lines perform thematic work without advancing situation or choice. No severe artifacts, but cumulative scaffold lowers the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist's daughter as firefighter performing a healing ritual—offers a thematic inversion with potential. However, execution leans on familiar symbolic gestures (sprinkling sand, applying paste to scar, whispered affirmation) without fresh synthesis. The emotional arc follows a predictable trajectory from contemplation to affirmation. The migration of clouds and obsidian lagoon provide vivid anchors, but the ritual itself reads as decorative rather than risky or surprising. Mid-band: present but replaceable tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is signaled early and her firefighter identity frames backstory, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. The ritual is symbolic performance; no live option is tested or foreclosed. Present and logically consistent, but swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in setup (opening pouch), development (forming paste), and payoff (applied to scar). It is handled across three beats and its volcanic origin links thematically to fire/renewal. However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options; its function remains symbolic. All three gates are met, elevating it to mid-band, but lack of causal pressure caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is declared twice as theme but never dramatized as a choice under pressure. It does not shape tactics or create friction between wants and costs. Present as label only; no beat involvement or closure linkage beyond restatement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice as a descriptor of posture and movement but does not constrain or enable an action with cost. The trait is told, not shown through a visible tradeoff or decision. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The graft—mixing black sand with lagoon water and applying it to the scar—is setup, executed in the middle, and referenced at closure ("delicate crust"). It is the central physical action and irreplaceable in the ritual logic. However, it does not force a turn or narrow options; the protagonist proceeds without complication. All three gates met, strong specificity, but low causal pressure keeps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The coin appears in setup (pocket), is handled and its origin explained mid-story, and recurs in the final paragraph ("lay against her skin"). It seeds early and closes with a charged reprise ("note in her silent symphony"), meeting two gates. However, it does not enable or constrain a choice; its role is symbolic talisman. Lyric reprise lifts it above ornamental, but lack of causal work caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon is signaled in the opening line, provides the ritual site, and recurs in the mirror image near the end. It supplies the water for the paste and frames the action spatially. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; the protagonist could perform the ritual anywhere with water. Present across beats and in closure reprise, but postcard function limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Cloud migration is mentioned in the opening, middle ("continued," "journeying westward"), and close, framing the ritual's duration. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; time remains vague and untracked. Present and coherent but does not function as a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to prove that scars can sing") and recurs throughout, but it is never dramatized through a conflicted choice or cost. The protagonist's desire faces no friction or trade-off; the ritual proceeds smoothly to affirmation. Told and restated rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named explicitly and sustained through the setting's serene imagery (stillness, shimmer, reflection). Tone remains coherent and static; it does not modulate with pressure because no pressure arrives. The final image reprises the peaceful resolve, charging the close with thematic weight. Coherent and purposeful but lacks dynamic range, placing it in mid-band.</comment>
