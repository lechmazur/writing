<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris's claustrophobia is declared but never embodied in a micro-choice that alters tactics; it "claws at his mind" and "spikes" yet he simply "holds his ground" without visible cost or constraint. The grandfather motivation is stated once and never shapes a decision under pressure. Interior life consists of stock phrases ("deep-seated claustrophobia," "no longer just a spelunker") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation is asserted ("he was transformed") rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ending offers neither a decisive change in options nor a felt cost: Aris exits, looks back, smiles, and walks away with vague satisfaction ("found peace," "transformed"). The phase-transition sequence is narrated as passive witnessing ("he saw," "memories dissipated") rather than agency that alters stakes. The orientation test is borderline: "forgotten research facility" and "submerged during high tide" anchor setting and constraint by line 2, but "kneeling at the entrance" creates spatial ambiguity (inside or outside?) that persists through "moved through corridors." The dominant lens reads as Causal at setup (tidal window, gold fleck tracking) but the climax resolves through coincidental phase alignment and convenience (the device auto-completes the return) without protagonist decision, violating lens coherence at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal constraint and submerged facility are signaled early and pressure one beat (water seeping in), meeting the micro-setting test for low-band eligibility. Spatial choreography is vague: "entrance" vs. "inside" vs. "downward" vs. "central chamber" vs. "lab" never clarifies depth, distance, or relative position, and "walls lined with schematics" followed by "device in the center" lacks tactile grounding. The gold fleck "tracks invisible things" but the method of tracking (visual glow? directional pull?) is never shown through Aris's embodied perception. Sensory detail leans heavily on stock phrasing: "thick with a crashing hush," "throats," "translucent, then gaseous" without POV-specific filtering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The declared stake ("stand by the unremembered") is static; no on-page reversal or deepening narrows options or changes knowledge. Aris moves linearly from entrance to lab to activation without a choice that trades one live option for another. The tidal window closes ("water began seeping in") but does not force a tactical shift—Aris simply activates the device and exits. The resolution is executed by the device and the "gold fleck beam," not by protagonist agency; coincidence (tidal alignment) enables the outcome. Cost is asserted ("claustrophobia spiked") but not paid in action or forfeiture that alters later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of remembering the forgotten emerges from events, but the final paragraph ("he had tracked the invisible and made it seen," "every fear faced, every memory honored") states the thesis rather than embodying it through image or action. "Crashing hush" recurs but remains metaphorically inert, never reweighting the stake. The phase-transition concept is treated as exposition rather than a thematic vehicle that complicates choice. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction: Aris achieves his goal fully, faces no ambiguity or counter-reading, and walks away with closure ("found peace," "transformed") that resolves complexity into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, and diction remains in Aris's register without head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: "thick with a crashing hush," "corridors that felt like throats," "walls shimmered" could belong to any narrator. Register drifts into semi-technical abstraction at the climax ("phase transition," "between-state," "conduits for phase energy") without grounding in Aris's embodied perception. Purposeful compression is evident in the rapid phase-sequence, but the final paragraph dilutes voice with summary-craft phrasing ("keeper of forgotten tales," "balance between tidal changes") that sounds like thematic scaffolding rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "stand by the unremembered" / "to stand by them" / "stood by them" / "stood tall in memory"; "return" / "return sequence" / "return through phase transitions" / "returned through transition" across nine instances. Template cadence: "The air inside was thick… The codex glowed… The gold fleck led… The facility hummed… The gold fleck now tracked…" in successive paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without embodiment: "corridors that felt like throats," "crashing hush" (seven times), "invisible traces." The final six paragraphs stack near-synonyms ("unremembered were now remembered," "forgotten tales," "secrets now shared," "story… now etched") that restate the closure idea without propulsion. Information density is low; beats advance setting or exposition rather than character choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (phase-transition technology traps researchers between states; descendant retrieves their memories via tidal-cycle alignment) combines familiar elements (lost expedition, inherited quest, magical artifact) without a fresh synthesis. The claustrophobic spelunker exploring underwater ruins is internally contradictory yet never dramatized as character friction. Emotional specificity is absent: Aris's grandfather connection is told once and his final satisfaction ("smiled, knowing") is generic. The transformation test fails: swapping "undersea research facility" for "abandoned space station" and "phase transitions" for "dimensional rifts" would leave plot and arc unchanged. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Aris's claustrophobia is mentioned three times but never constrains a choice; he "holds his ground" without visible cost or tactical shift. His decision to activate the device is inevitable and uncontested, not a turn point. Present in setup and ending; no middle development that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The codex is carried, placed on a pedestal, and its gold fleck streams into the device—three distinct beats. It tracks invisible traces (middle) and becomes blank at closure, signaling purpose fulfilled. However, Aris never makes a choice *because of* the codex's constraint; it functions as a linear plot token. Early signal and closure participation present; causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Undersea cables are mentioned as "silent on the ocean floor," "still drawing energy," used by researchers as "conduits for phase energy," and "hummed anew with transmitted stories" at closure. The cables enable the device but do not constrain Aris's tactics or choice; he never interacts with them. Present in setup, middle exposition, and ending; no decision shaped by their state.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Gold fleck's attribute ("tracks invisible things") is stated and shown in two beats (leading downward, revealing memory-patterns). However, tracking is passive guidance; Aris does not face a cost or trade-off tied to what the attribute reveals or withholds. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is ornamental (beam shooting out) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Return" is the stated motivation and the climax action (initiating return sequence, restoring stories). The word recurs nine times and the final paragraph declares success. However, the return is executed by the device and tidal alignment, not by Aris's contested choice. Present across all beats but swappable with "rescue" or "recover" without structural change; no irreplaceable specificity or visible cost unique to "return."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Phase transitions are explained in two exposition beats ("method to return through phase transitions," "shifting the facility's state from solid to liquid to gas") and enacted at climax ("walls shimmered, becoming translucent, then gaseous"). The method is stated but its mechanics are never tested or constrained—Aris simply activates the device. Present in setup, middle, and ending; no choice shaped by how phase transitions work or fail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility frames the quest (setup), supplies the device and schematics (middle), and "slept beneath the waves, its secrets now shared" (ending). Tightening spaces and seeping water pressure Aris's claustrophobia claim, though without altering tactics. Three-gate presence and clear causal role in two beats (entry, device discovery) elevate the score; however, spatial details are vague and the facility could be replaced with any abandoned structure without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tidal window is declared at setup ("brief window between tidal changes"), pressures the climax once ("tidal window was closing; water began seeping in"), and marks the exit ("tidal change complete"). However, time is never tracked beat-by-beat; the window's duration and remaining margin are vague, diluting urgency. Present in setup and closure; middle development is weak (water seeps but does not force a tactical shift).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To stand by the unremembered" is stated as motivation (setup) and repeated in action beats ("to stand by them," "stood by them"). The motivation is never dramatized as conflicted choice; Aris's goal and his actions align without friction or cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; no moment where standing by the unremembered competes with survival or another want. Told-only, no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" recurs seven times as a label for silence-with-sound, appearing in setup, middle, and ending ("carried the crashing hush within him"). Tone remains static—solemn and declarative—without modulation under pressure or ironic tension. The phrase is ornamental metaphor rather than a tonal constraint that shapes voice or stakes. Present across beats but does not charge the final image or alter Aris's perception.</comment>
