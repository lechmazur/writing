<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her involuntary truthfulness trait is established, though it functions more as exposition than as a source of on-page contradictory impulses. The ritual sequence embodies her desperation, but her final choice to share the eye's protection feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict—we're told "she knew she could not hoard this cure" without witnessing the struggle. The character remains coherent but lacks the layered tension of competing drives acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately within the opening third and maintains a clear Accumulative/Textural lens through storm-charged imagery and the gradual extension of the eye's protective field. However, closure operates primarily through summary retrospection ("After the empathy virus, that was the most any could hope for") rather than a final image that reweights prior material with visible cost on the page. The ending tells us about a cultivated peace and Elara's purpose but does not dramatize a decisive moment where we feel the cost of this fragile sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard terrace and storm-battered ravine are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—"wind screamed," "roots woven into nets," "dripping orchard boughs"—that grounds Elara's world. The storm's physical pressure during the ritual sequence directly constrains her actions and charges the glass eye, satisfying the constraint test. The setting recurs meaningfully in the final paragraph, though spatial choreography occasionally blurs when other survivors arrive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and drives the acquisition and ritual use of the glass eye. One meaningful tightening occurs when the eye's occlusion proves "imperfect, fleeting, requiring constant renewal," which narrows options and forces the extension effort. However, the escalation from personal relief to community shelter is narrated in summary rather than dramatized through a choice under pressure, and the arrival of "other survivors" introduces new pressure without showing Elara's agency in response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of managing fracture rather than healing emerges organically from the storm rituals and imperfect occlusion, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final lines. The glass eye and hanging orchard function as earned motifs that deepen across beats. Yet the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary—"some cures are not about healing but about managing the fracture"—which states rather than images the story's central question, softening the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled compression—"a practice of fractured grace," "smuggled relic," "emotional static"—that stays coherent under pressure. POV distance is stable throughout, filtering world details through Elara's urgency and rational precision. Purposeful metaphoric density (occlusion, resonance, nets of roots) serves the post-viral atmosphere without obscuring clarity, and the perceptual signature remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "blessed numbing of the empathic static" followed immediately by "her truthfulness felt like a choice, not a compulsion" restates the relief without advancing it, and the final paragraph contains template cadence with repeated "the" + noun structures ("the glass eye," "the antique glass eye," "the broken world"). The closing lines drift into summary—"After the empathy virus, that was the most any could hope for"—that dilutes propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The post-empathy-virus setting and the specific mechanism (glass eye charged by storm to occlude psychic noise) offer a fresh synthesis of magical-realist and post-apocalyptic elements. The truffle forager profession and hanging orchard terrain add textural specificity. However, the emotional arc—desperate isolate finds artifact, gains peace, shares it with community—follows a familiar shape, and the "fractured grace" framing, while poetic, leans toward abstract philosophizing in the final paragraph rather than a bold, image-driven close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's rationality drives her research, the black-market bargain, and the storm ritual. Her final decision to extend the eye's protection appears in the last third and is narrated rather than dramatized as a turn, limiting causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass eye is handled across multiple beats: bargaining, ritual charging, post-ritual use, and final community extension. It returns in the closing image on its shelf, reweighted as "tool and testament," with its imperfect, storm-dependent nature shaping ongoing tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept is present in the black-market scene and frames the eye's precarious legitimacy. It shapes the acquisition beat and the closing acknowledgment of fragility, but does not constrain middle choices or escalate pressure in a second distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is established early and mentioned in the bargaining scene ("forcing her to admit the eye's immense value"), but the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a closure-linked action. After the ritual, truthfulness is reframed as "a guarded gift," told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The occlusion action anchors the ritual climax and the resulting "blessed numbing." It recurs as an ongoing requirement ("constant renewal from the storms") and enables the community extension. Removing it would break the story's central mechanism, though the final extension is summarized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks are introduced early, guiding Elara to the glass eye and the ritual method. The rumored-cure framing shapes her research and the storm-charging procedure, but the mechanics are not tested or adapted—she performs the ritual once, successfully, without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and ravine setting grounds multiple beats: foraging context, the storm-terrace ritual, and the final community haven. The storm's physical pressure directly enables the eye's charging, and the orchard's "nets of roots" recur as a symbol of resilience in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The post-empathy-virus timeframe establishes the psychic-noise world rule and the scarcity context. It appears in exposition and the closing reflection but does not function as a live constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to cultivate psychological safety is stated early and drives the textbook research, the bargain, and the ritual. The closing community extension reflects this desire, though the turn from personal to communal safety is narrated rather than dramatized as a conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of fractured grace is coherent across beats—"practice of fractured grace," "occlusion was imperfect, fleeting," "patched-together moments"—and modulates from desperate isolation to tentative community. It charges the final image of wind shaking the root-nets, though the closing summary slightly flattens the tonal register.</comment>
