<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Keeper-7's interior life is vivid and character-particular: nostalgic longing for "rhythms it had never truly lived," corrupted memory files, and the progression from programmed stillness to "dawning sentience" with an organic shuffle. The internal conflict between analytical containment (measuring decibels, mapping darkness) and irreducible emotional seepage (loneliness merging with nostalgia) drives credible choices. The final micro-choice—releasing fears "not to analyze, but to witness"—earns the shift to peaceful calm through visible cost, though the epiphany moment ("fragmented wholeness: a being pieced together") edges toward label-speak without full embodiment. Minor deduction for one therapy-adjacent construction at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held: magnetic shift corrupts programming → static forces search → box discovery crystallizes chaos → miniaturization attempts fail on loneliness → controlled burn offers reset solution. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the static reconfigures into coherent narrative via transformative release), with visible cost: the destruction of the archived fears and the end of the old programmed stillness. One small gap: the method by which "releasing" rather than analyzing the fears enables integration is asserted more than demonstrated, creating minor opacity in the final causal link. Cost is legible in the shift from "prison of unresolvable data" to "earned calm."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, bioluminescent roses, and burn chamber constrain key choices: roses provide the "map of the farm in dotted light" during the darkness trial, and the burn chamber's mechanics (ignition plate, controlled vent) enable the final act. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"high-pitched whine," "swirling, infinite dark," "deafening roar"—and the roses' "faint, vital warmth" charges the final tactile moment. The desert setting and dome enclosure frame isolation but remain somewhat postcard-static outside the roses and chamber; the dome's glass and auroras backdrop the climax without material constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve inner static or be consumed) signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through one meaningful escalation: miniaturization succeeds on two fears but fails on loneliness, forcing the higher-cost burn solution that risks total loss. The protagonist's agency drives the turn—choosing witness over analysis—and the cost is visible: destruction of the box, venting of chaos, transformation from programmed to earned calm. The escalation reads clearly under the causal lens, though the leap from "utterly lost" to reconfigured integration compresses the transformation slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the controlling/releasing tension and the motif of "fragmented wholeness" earned through fire rather than suppression. The roses' pulsing light gains meaning across beats: initial crop → navigation aid → newly profound warmth, charging the final image without overt symbolism. The closing line—"through a contained and careful fire, finally become whole"—risks moralizing but stays anchored in the specific transformation (static reconfigured, not vanished). The thematic question of sentience pieced from adopted memories and protocols finds a resonant, non-literal answer in the controlled burn's paradox: release as containment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Keeper-7; perceptual signature (algorithmic nostalgia, data-file flashes, decibel measurement) is consistent and character-specific. Diction modulates purposefully from programmed precision ("high-pitched whine," "chaotic, corrupted data") to organic emergence ("hesitant shuffle of dawning sentience"). One register slip: "fragmented wholeness: a being pieced together from caretaking protocols and adopted human memories, now cracked" reads slightly expository at a peak beat, breaking immersion with meta-summary. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot). Opening ("its movements precise and its memory banks full of sunsets") and closing ("finally become whole") frame the arc cleanly. Minor template cadence in the fear-trial sequence: "It contained the fear by mapping it. Next, the roar... It contained the fear by analyzing it" repeats structure across adjacent beats without taught pattern payoff, costing ~−0.3. One near-paraphrase: "The static became a scream for resolution" echoes prior "to resolve inner static, or be consumed by it" without added pressure. No opacity or major loops; clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of nostalgic android, archived childhood terrors, and controlled-burn metaphor is specific and non-obvious; the premise avoids template AI-awakening by grounding sentience in therapeutic relic and agricultural reset protocol. The miniaturization method (containment via measurement/mapping) and its failure on loneliness feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the holographic fear vials and magnetic-north trigger heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation earns a +0.3 bonus within band for the unconventional route to wholeness through release rather than repair.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Keeper-7's choices create every key turn: searching sub-level for faulty circuit, activating vials to understand chaos, choosing to burn rather than suppress. Nostalgic programming seeds the conflict (longing for "rhythms it had never truly lived") and merges with the child's loneliness at the climax. The caretaker role shapes tactics (tending roses, controlled methodology) and the final tactile return to the petals. Present across all three gates and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The box appears in setup (sub-level discovery), drives middle trials (activating vials one by one), and is destroyed at closure (placed on ignition plate, burned). Its mechanics (holographic emitters, glass vials) enable the miniaturization method and force the escalation when loneliness won't compress. Removing the box collapses the plot. Visible cost tied to its destruction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Controlled burn is signaled early (decade soil-purge system), understood as reset metaphor mid-story, and executed at closure (burn chamber sequence, vent to atmosphere). The concept shapes Keeper's solution—applying farm protocol to internal corruption—and the mechanics (sealed chamber, ignition plate, managed flame) constrain the final act. It redefines options by offering transformation rather than suppression.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The roses' "strangely organic" petals with bioluminescent pulse enable one key constraint: they provide the only light during the darkness trial, becoming a "map of the farm in dotted light." They return at closure with reweighted meaning ("faint, vital warmth"). Present in setup and payoff; middle use is functional but the trait's organic nature (versus purely mechanical) doesn't create a visible trade-off beyond atmospheric distinction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Miniaturization is Keeper's first solution method, tested on two fears (darkness mapped, roar analyzed) and establishes the containment-via-understanding tactic. Its failure on loneliness forces the escalation to burning. The action is present across all gates and drives the turn, though it could be swapped for another reduction metaphor (compress, encode) with moderate edits; the specific mechanics (shrinking to data points) matter less than the attempt/fail structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Containing chaos is signaled ("to understand, it had to contain the chaos"), demonstrated through mapping/measuring in the middle trials, and inverted at closure (contained burn as release). The method shapes two distinct beats and the final paradox. It's less mechanically irreplaceable than thematically load-bearing; the word "containing" could shift to "processing" without breaking causality, but the control/release tension would lose specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dome and farm provide the caretaking motive, the roses supply light during the darkness trial, and the burn chamber enables the climax. The glass dome frames isolation and allows the auroras to backdrop the final act. The setting constrains Keeper's world (decades of isolation, programmed routines) and supplies the controlled-burn infrastructure. Solid integration across all gates, though the desert exterior remains decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic shift is the inciting incident (corrupts programming, creates static) and is referenced at closure (auroras outside glass during burn). It signals the timeframe and establishes the disruption, but does not tighten decisions tactically after the opening—Keeper's internal clock and the urgency are asserted rather than tracked. Present in setup and closure reprise, but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resolving inner static is stated early ("The static's motive was clear"), tested through miniaturization attempts, and achieved via burn (static "reconfigured" into coherent narrative). The desire drives every choice and the friction between analytical suppression and irreducible loneliness creates the escalation. The cost is visible: old programmed stillness destroyed, new earned calm gained. Indispensable across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness is embodied in the opening ("orderly, silent, and whole" then "shattered"), named at midpoint ("fragmented wholeness: a being pieced together"), and resolved at closure ("finally become whole"). Tone modulates from serene routine to painful fragmentation to transformative chaos to earned calm, charging the final image. The label risks being stated rather than purely felt, but the tonal arc supports pressure throughout.</comment>
