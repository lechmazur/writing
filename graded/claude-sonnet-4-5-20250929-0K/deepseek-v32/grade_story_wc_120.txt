<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her action (mapping memories onto the nautilus) proceeds logically, but her interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The phrase "chronologically homesick heart beat in time with the recalled laughter" exemplifies label-speak that asserts emotion rather than dramatizing it through micro-choices under pressure. The final moment shows her sustained by "the music of herself," but no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges—exhaustion "loomed" but "did not hit," which removes the stakes established by the timeframe. Internal conflict is gestured at but never acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elara maps memories across the nautilus chambers, and the mirrored horizon serves as the amplification mechanism at dawn. Orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, crystal desk) appear early. The closure—a symphony of visible emotion-waves across the mirrored horizon—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is unclear: "exhaustion loomed, but it did not hit; she was sustained by the music of herself" cancels the timeframe constraint rather than paying it. The lens holds, but the cost test fails the quick test in Q2: I cannot point to an exact sentence where a visible, felt, or conceptual price is legible at the ending beat. Apply −0.5 for missing cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and consistently present. The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting: Elara traces memories onto its chambers, and it glows with mapped data, directly shaping her final action. The mirrored horizon at dawn is the conduit for her conduction attempt, so environment constrains and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (spire → crystal desk → spiral stairs → lake's edge) is clear. The quick test is satisfied: the nautilus and mirrored horizon constrain her method and charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conducting the unheard symphony before exhaustion hits—is signaled early and tightened by the dawn window. The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through the mapping process. However, the final sentence removes the cost: "exhaustion loomed, but it did not hit" negates the timeframe constraint without trade-off. The protagonist's agency (completing the mapping, wading onto the ice, conducting) drives the sequence, but because the forecasted price never lands on the page, escalation lacks the felt consequence required for higher bands. One meaningful tightening occurs (dawn as the only window), but the cost clarity is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of chronological homesickness and the desire to give form to lost time emerges concretely through the nautilus mapping and the mirrored horizon as a lens/conduit. The fortune "The horizon is not a line, but a lens" is a deliberate self-cue that refracts the undertaking without overt moralizing. The final image—golden joy, blue sorrow, silver wonder dancing in silent harmony—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the ending hedges: "exhaustion loomed, but it did not hit; she was sustained by the music of herself" is a thesis-like assertion rather than an image that reweights prior material through cost. Subtext operates well in the mapped memories (rain on hot soil, dandelion clock, father's whistled tune), but the closure drifts toward summary assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; psychic distance remains controlled. Diction is lyric and character-particular ("upturned hush," "temporal truth," "conductor of unheard symphonies"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, the prose under peak stress (the final conduction) leans into elevated, poetic register that risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy: "They danced across the mirrored horizon, reflecting and amplifying, a symphony of lost time made manifest" reads more like narrated spectacle than filtered perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the final beat's voice flattens into summary rather than tightening. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout, with most sentences carrying metaphor or elevated diction ("cryptic fortune cookie writer," "attribute of being chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies"). While lyric compression is purposeful, runs like "upturned hush," "temporal truth," "chronologically homesick," "unheard symphonies," "mirrored horizon" pile abstractions without variation in register or rhythm, creating a template cadence. The phrase "Her chronologically homesick heart beat in time with the recalled laughter of a younger self" is a paraphrase loop: the concept is re-stated in metaphor without added pressure. Apply baseline −0.6 for template cadence and metaphor density in peak beats, plus −0.2 for paraphrase loop, totaling −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptic fortune-writer, nautilus-shell memory mapping, and mirrored-horizon conduction is specific and non-obvious. The story commits fully to its lyric, concept-driven premise and follows through to the visual symphony at dawn. However, the emotional arc—loneliness, mapping, conduction, sustained triumph—traces a template path without friction or irony. The final image (colored emotions dancing) is vivid but leans toward abstraction rather than grounded particulars that would make it feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and voice is evident, but the lack of cost at closure undermines the sense that the story has earned its transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (fortune-cookie writer) frames her voice and thematic lens. However, her choices are procedural (mapping memories, descending stairs, wading onto ice) rather than turning the plot in a new direction. The occupation itself does not constrain a key decision or alter tactics under pressure—it provides texture and irony (she writes prophecies but seeks her own past) but remains ornamental to the causal chain. One beat: she recalls the fortune "The horizon is not a line, but a lens," which reframes her undertaking, lifting the score slightly. Present by end of first third; no middle development choice; closure participation is passive (she conducts, but the writer role does not shape that act). Cap 4.6 for missing setup of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell segment is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (placed on desk, traced with stylus, glows with mapped data, held like a baton, flows memories at dawn), and is indispensable to the closure—without it, the conduction cannot occur. Its logarithmic spiral as "a perfect chart of growth" justifies the mapping method and its chambers hold the memories that manifest at dawn. Specific cost: the mapping drains her ("a siphon on her very spirit"), and the shell's glow signals completion. Appears in setup, middle development (mapping), and closure (conduction). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, beat involvement (three distinct beats), and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon is introduced in the first third as "a vast eye looking back at itself" and recurs frequently. At dawn it becomes "most potent," the exact point where Elara conducts, and the memories "danced across the mirrored horizon, reflecting and amplifying." The concept shapes the stakes (she must act when sky and ice align perfectly) and provides the amplification mechanism. However, it remains largely atmospheric—beautiful and thematically resonant, but the mechanics of why the duplication enables conduction are asserted rather than dramatized through constrained choice. Present in setup, implied in middle (she awaits dawn), and active in closure. Causal pressure is present but soft; closure linkage is strong. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not narrow options through cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Chronologically homesick" appears early as Elara's defining trait and motivates the entire undertaking (mapping childhood memories to conduct lost moments). However, the phrase is used as a label rather than dramatized through on-page tradeoffs. She "ached not for a place, but for the vanished seasons of her childhood"—told, not shown. The trait does not visibly constrain a choice with cost; instead, it drives the goal but does not create friction or force a sacrifice. Present in setup; no middle development choice where the trait narrows options; closure participation is thematic echo only. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dawn is the timeframe's endpoint and the closure's trigger. Elara must act "before exhaustion hit," and "the action of dawn was her only window." The story builds to "As the first sliver of sun broke the line, she raised the shell like a baton. In that upturned hush of morning, Elara conducted." Dawn is not swappable—the mirrored horizon's potency peaks at that liminal light, making it the necessary moment. Present in setup (signaled as the deadline), shapes middle urgency (she must finish mapping by dawn), and is the exact mechanism of closure. Causal pressure, closure linkage, beat involvement (three), irreplaceability, and cost connection (she risks missing the window). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—mapping childhood memories onto the nautilus shell's chambers—is introduced early and detailed on the page: "With a silver stylus, she traced memories onto the spiral, each chamber a different year. She mapped the smell of rain on hot soil, the geometry of a dandelion clock, her father's whistled tune." The method is necessary for the conduction: the shell "pulsed with a soft, internal light, nearly full of mapped data," and at dawn "the mapped memories flowed from the shell." Present in setup, executed in middle (mapping beats), and the basis for closure (memories flow). The method is irreplaceable—another approach would require different mechanics. Causal pressure, closure linkage, beat involvement (two distinct beats), and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake anchor the setting throughout. The spire "seemed to hum with the concentration of her endeavor," and she "descended the spiral stairs to the lake's edge" for the conduction. The frozen lake provides the mirrored horizon, the necessary surface for the dawn act. The setting is present in setup, middle (she works in the spire), and closure (wades onto the ice). However, the spire itself is more atmospheric than constraining—she could theoretically work anywhere with the nautilus and reach the lake. The lake is more essential: it supplies the mirrored surface. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong. Beat involvement (two: workspace, lake). Specificity is high, but the spire's necessity is softer than the lake's.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "before exhaustion hits her fragile, aging body" is stated early and recurs: "she had to act before exhaustion hit and scattered her focus into nothing." The urgency shapes her choice to finish tonight and conduct at dawn. However, at closure the cost is canceled: "Exhaustion loomed, but it did not hit; she was sustained by the music of herself." The clock mattered in the middle (she pushes through fatigue) but does not land as a live constraint at the end. Present in setup, shapes middle urgency (she cannot stop), but closure negates it. Causal pressure in middle; closure participation is negative (removes the constraint). Beat involvement (two). Cap due to canceled cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to become the conductor of unheard symphonies"—is introduced early, repeated ("To conduct the unheard was to give form to the formless"), and drives every action. At dawn she conducts, fulfilling the desire. The motivation is specific and shapes the entire plot. However, it is never conflicted—she wants it, pursues it, achieves it. No friction between want and cost (exhaustion is threatened but removed). Dramatized through the mapping and conduction, but the lack of trade-off limits the score. Present in setup, drives middle beats, and is the basis for closure. Causal pressure, closure linkage, beat involvement (three). Specificity is high, but the absence of visible cost at closure prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Upturned hush" is introduced in the second sentence ("Her life was one of upturned hush, a silent expectancy") and recurs at closure ("In that upturned hush of morning, Elara conducted"). The tone—quiet, expectant, suspended—is sustained throughout with diction like "silent," "whisper," "soft internal light," "breathtaking harmony." It modulates subtly: the hush deepens as night solidifies, then opens into the visual symphony at dawn. The reprise at closure reweights the opening mood, charging the final image. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, and the final reprise elevates meaning. Present in setup, sustained in middle, and charged in closure. Strong lyric integration; closure linkage is excellent.</comment>
