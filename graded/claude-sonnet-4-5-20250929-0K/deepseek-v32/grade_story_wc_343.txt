<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested through choice under pressure. The "sociable isolation" and "diligently curious" traits are merely labels without embodied contradiction or cost. Her discovery unfolds through passive observation rather than decisions that foreclose paths. The captain's approval at the end arrives without prior friction, so no change is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens through discovery → captain consultation → navigation → stranded luminance, but the closure is descriptive cataloging rather than a decisive change with felt cost. Elara's achievement is complete when she shows the captain her notes; the final luminance sequence is confirmatory rather than transformative. No path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The airship, hopscotch board, and phrasebook are present and described, but setting does not constrain choice. The hopscotch board is cleaned and decoded without physical or social friction. Starling murmurations frame the timeframe but do not pressure tactics. Spatial choreography (observation deck, stern, captain's location) remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance—is signaled early but never faces opposition or trade-off. Elara's decoding proceeds smoothly; the captain accepts her work immediately. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible cost. The phenomenon appears on cue, and she catalogs it without struggle. Escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity and mentor legacy emerges through particulars (phrasebook, Aris's vanishing, hopscotch decoding). However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "sociable isolation lingered, but it was now a comfort rather than a burden" and "she had found a connection to something greater." The explain-everything ending and thematic echo lower the score. The stranded luminance image itself carries some resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (curious, pattern-seeking) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("profound sociable isolation," "ethereal glow," "testament to the wonders") that feels authored rather than character-bound. Dialogue between Elara and Bray is functional but brief. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she noted") recur without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Sentence openings vary adequately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She was surrounded by the chatter of crew members, but she felt a profound sociable isolation, immersed in her thoughts and observations" repeats the isolation concept. "Stranded luminance" and "starling murmurations" are echoed across many lines without fresh context. Template cadence in the final third: "Elara detailed... She referenced... The crew gathered... Yet, Elara felt... She remembered..." (five consecutive "Elara/She" stems). Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The antique airship, polyglot phrasebook, and atmospheric light phenomenon offer period flavor, but the plot follows a familiar discovery template: apprentice decodes clues, captain validates, phenomenon appears as predicted. The hopscotch-as-map conceit is clever but underexplored. Elara's journey lacks friction or transformation, so the synthesis feels more ornamental than inevitable. No bold risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her curiosity motivates observation, but her choices do not create turns. She cleans the hopscotch board, translates symbols, and records patterns—all discovery steps, not decisions with cost. The captain's course change is his decision, not hers. Missing middle development (choice under pressure) and weak closure participation (she catalogs, does not decide) cap the score. Early setup +0.3, beat involvement (cleaning, translating, showing notes) +0.9, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental closure −0.5 lower the final score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: Elara cherishes it (setup), opens it to translate the hopscotch board (middle), and references it again for terminology while cataloging luminance (closure mention). However, the dog-ear itself—the specified element—is mentioned twice but never drives a choice. The phrasebook's role is reference, not constraint. Early signal +0.3, two functional beats +0.9, but the dog-ear is ornamental (the page is opened, not the dog-ear's presence altering tactics) −0.8, and swappability (any marked reference text could serve) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is the story's discovery target, signaled in the dog-eared phrasebook page early and achieved at the climax. It shapes the dominant stake and appears in the closure scene. However, it does not constrain tactics; Elara's method (decode hopscotch, follow murmurations) is independent of the luminance's properties until it appears. Early setup +0.3, beat involvement (phrasebook, arrival, cataloging) +0.9, closure linkage (final image) +1.0, but the concept is more goal than active pressure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is a label repeated across the text ("diligently curious mind," "diligently curious nature," "diligently recorded") but never shown as a trait that constrains or enables a choice with cost. Elara's actions (cleaning, translating, noting) are curious, but "diligent" versus impulsive curiosity never matters on the page. Label-only −0.8, no middle choice enabled by this trait −0.5, ornamental mentions −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Note" appears throughout: Elara notes patterns in her journal, notes the hopscotch board, notes matches between birds and board, and the captain studies her notes. The action drives the middle turn (decoding) and enables the captain's decision. However, it is passive observation rather than a choice with cost. Early signal +0.3, two beats (journal work, showing captain) +0.9, causal link (notes → course change) +0.8, but swappability (observe, record, sketch could replace with minor edits) −0.6 and lack of cost tied to noting −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dusty hopscotch board is cleaned, decoded using the phrasebook, and compared to starling murmurations to unlock the path to stranded luminance. It appears in setup (Elara notices it), drives the middle turn (decoding reveals the map), and its pattern shapes the ending (successful navigation). Early signal +0.5, two beats (cleaning/decoding, comparison) +0.9, causal pressure (map enables navigation) +1.2, closure linkage (pattern used to reach luminance) +1.0. However, the method is told-summary more than dramatized struggle −0.5, lowering from potential 7+ to ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The antique airship is the continuous setting, named and described (observation deck, stern, engines, instruments). It enables the journey but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The crew's presence is mentioned but not used. The airship could be replaced by any sky vessel without changing the plot. Present throughout +0.4, but postcard description without pressure −0.8, swappability −0.6, and no middle choice shaped by setting −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Amid starling murmurations" frames the story (mentioned in opening third, middle, and final paragraphs) and the murmurations' patterns are compared to the hopscotch board. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions. The murmurations are observed at leisure, and their peak arrival is convenient rather than a deadline. Early signal +0.3, two beats (initial observation, peak arrival) +0.9, but no live clock altering moves −0.7 and ornamental use in closure (they circle but do not pressure) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to chart the next great discovery and honor Aris—is stated in the opening third and remains present through her actions. However, it is never conflicted or tested by cost. She achieves her goal smoothly without friction between want and price. Early signal +0.3, beat involvement (journal work, captain conversation, cataloging) +0.9, closure link (achievement stated) +0.7, but told-only motivation (no on-page friction) −0.8 and no cost tied to the desire −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named three times and described (surrounded by crew yet distant), but the tone is static. Elara feels the same isolation at the beginning, middle, and end; the final paragraph declares it "now a comfort rather than a burden" without dramatizing the shift. Label-only −0.8, no modulation under pressure −0.6, and expository closure ("it was now a comfort") rather than charged image −0.5.</comment>
