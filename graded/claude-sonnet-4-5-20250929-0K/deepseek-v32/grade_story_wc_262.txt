<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a cipher throughout—her "crystal gazer" label never translates into embodied choice under pressure. The piece tells us she "incubated sorrow" and "had to incubate these fleeting impressions," but these are summary labels without contradictory impulses or micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. Her "motivation was satisfied" arrives as declaration rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization with visible cost. Interior life consists of spatial metaphors and abstract processing rather than contradictory emotional states acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillates between accumulative/textural (dust-mote air, forgotten lyrics as refrain) and causal (psychometry unlocking past) without committing. Orientation penalty applies: who/where/when anchored adequately by ~120 words, waiving that deduction. However, no meaningful on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara simply proceeds through her reading without a choice that narrows options. The "closure" is told—"she had found the repository"—rather than shown through a decisive image or reconfiguration with felt cost. The film strip "seemed to pulse" and she "slowly wound" it, but no before/after is legible in her stance or the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly sketched ("gears and reels like a clockwork city," "hushed thunder") and the spatial particulars are consistent. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: none of the booth's machinery, dust, or confined space alters Elara's tactics or charges the final image. The film strip itself—handled, touched, wound—does more work than the booth. Sensory detail (dust-mote air, spiral stairs) is selective and voice-filtered, lifting the score above purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elara's psychometry reading proceeds without friction, obstacle, or trade-off; she simply perceives, incubates, and concludes. No reversal or deepening forecloses a live option. The "hushed thunder crested" and "acknowledgment" are declared effects rather than consequences of protagonist agency. Coincidence does not resolve here because nothing meaningfully complicates—pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unused love is stored in the silence after goodbyes" emerges as thesis statement rather than from concrete dramatic particulars. The goodbye letters and forgotten lyrics function as symbolic tokens without constraining Elara's choices or reweighting prior material through the ending image. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "Elara had given it a witness, and thus, a home" and "in the finding, had begun to use it." No plausible counter-reading exists; theme is asserted rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"spatially imaginative mind," "cool and steady" fingers—but diction drifts into elevated register ("interstices of human experience," "repository," "crucible") that clashes with the supposed immediacy of psychic contact. Sentence stems recur: "She saw…," "She had…," "Elara realized…," "Elara's…" across multiple lines without purposeful variation. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose reads more like committee-written poetic summary than a singular narrative consciousness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "unused love was stored" recurs in varied phrasing at least six times. Template cadence dominates: "She saw…," "She had…," "The forgotten lyrics…," "The hushed thunder…" run in parallel without taught pattern. Stock metaphors pile up—"paper tombs," "void of might-have-been," "wave of serene acceptance"—without tension or specificity. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to sigh") dull immediacy in multiple peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("seemed to sigh"), triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—psychic reads forgotten film to locate metaphysical storage of unexpressed emotion—is conceptually interesting but executed through well-worn psychometry tropes and abstract spatial metaphors. The goodbye letters, wartime partings, and "love never delivered" are familiar material without fresh synthesis. Transformation test fails: swap Elara for any generic psychic and the arc holds unchanged. No bold risk elevates; the piece hedges into poetic safety rather than committing to concrete stakes or a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara observes and processes but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "crystal gazer" label is ornamental; the role could be replaced with "historian" or "empath" without structural change. Present in setup and ending, but beats consist of passive reception rather than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Film strip is handled in at least three beats: initial touch (~line 8), warming from contact (~line 23), and winding back (~line 28). Its images (documentary reel, wartime partings) supply the central revelations. However, the strip's properties (fragile, celluloid) do not constrain Elara's method or alter her tactics; it functions as portal rather than obstacle. Closure linkage is weak—wound onto reel as clean-up, not charged reprise. Crosses two gates (setup, middle), eligible to mid-5s; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters appear in the film's images and are thematically central ("capsule of affection never delivered," "paper tombs," "spatial anchor"), but they do not change Elara's options or methods on the page. They are observed content rather than tactical elements. Present in middle and ending beats, but swappable with "love poems" or "unsent confessions" without loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is asserted five times as label ("Her spatially imaginative mind," "her fullest spatially imaginative power," "spatially imaginative landscape," "spatially imaginative gaps," "Her spatially imaginative journey") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Elara's mental mapping is told, not shown through a trade-off or consequence. Label-only use; no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears in three beats: "had to incubate these fleeting impressions" (~line 12), "incubated the sorrow" (~line 16), "She incubated this vision" (~line 21). The action is thematic but abstract—described as mental holding without on-page duration, risk, or interruption. No turn traces causally to the act of incubation; swappable with "contemplate" or "process." Present across beats but mechanically repeated without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early ("Her method would be psychometry reading, touching the celluloid") and executed ("her psychometry reading complete"). The touch mechanism matters—"fingers… brushed the film strip's edge, and the past surged forward"—and the reading spans multiple beats. However, the mechanics impose no friction or cost; Elara simply receives visions without effort, doubt, or consequence. Crosses setup and middle gates; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Vintage movie palace projection booth is established early with vivid detail ("gears and reels like a clockwork city," "hushed gloom," "spiral stairs") and mentioned in closure ("projection booth returned to mere dust"). However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome—she could perform the reading in any quiet space. Booth is atmosphere rather than crucible. Crosses setup and closure gates; lyric reprise present but without reweighting stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics search for tune" recurs as atmospheric refrain ("seemed to search," "gained a tentative melody," "found a firmer tune," "sang their complete tune," "now a tune she would never forget") but imposes no temporal pressure or deadline. Time is untracked; Elara's reading could take minutes or hours with no consequence. The lyrics mature in parallel with her insight but do not tighten decisions. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Motivation—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared in the opening ("motivated by a singular need") and restated at closure ("Elara's motivation was satisfied"). The quest frames the piece, but no on-page friction tests her desire; she encounters no competing want, doubt, or cost. Told rather than dramatized through choice. Functional setup and closure mention, but no middle development through conflicted action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears six times as tonal anchor ("tone was one of hushed thunder," "hushed thunder in the booth intensified," "hushed thunder crested," "hushed thunder receding," "hushed thunder now a steady rhythm," "hushed thunder faded to a whisper"). The oxymoron is consistent and modulates slightly with narrative beats (intensifies, crests, recedes). However, the effect is static mood rather than tone that charges the final image with new meaning. Present across all gates; coherent but not indispensable.</comment>
