<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is signaled early and drives the final sequence, but her interiority leans on stock phrasing ("desperate motivation," "profound confusion") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to repurpose the station's systems feels enacted rather than earned through visible internal conflict; we see decision without the contradictory impulses that would make renunciation costly. Emotional progression is summarized ("her heart...gave a painful thud") instead of dramatized through perception and micro-choices under pressure. The compass rose functions more as talisman than as a constraint that forces her to weigh competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph; the shutdown backstory and time-dilation premise are legible by the second. The drive lens reads as Causal: the glimpse of the new coordinate triggers her choice to escape the dilation pocket, and the final sequence enacts that choice with visible consequence (station motion, time unwinding). Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change—real-time reasserts itself, systems wake, the new coordinate pings—with felt cost (subjective years spent calculating, abandonment of keeper role). One meaningful tightening occurs when the power surge reveals the impossible star, narrowing her options from despair to exploration. The cost is clear in the final image ("her sketch complete, her exploration just beginning"), though the phrase "her exploration just beginning" tilts toward summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observation deck's transparent dome, starfield, and dormant systems are established early and constrain Elara's final choice: she channels "the last reserves of power into the long-dormant engines," and the station's groan is a tactile consequence. The time-dilation field functions as micro-setting, pressuring her perception ("each minute...equating to a year") and enabling the subjective years she needs to calculate escape maneuvers. Sensory detail is selective—"cold geometry," "faint glyph," "deep metallic sound"—but the deck itself remains somewhat generic; we lack the idiosyncratic wear or malfunction that would make this station irreplaceable. The final image ties setting to closure when "the starfield outside began to shift...from the slow unwinding of time's knot."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape from temporal isolation versus continued despair—is signaled in the opening ("a final act of exploration") and escalates causally: the glimpse of the new star (inciting reversal) forces Elara to cross-reference her sketch, which reveals the alignment as "a message across time," prompting her to repurpose the engines. Agency is clear: her choice to channel power and initiate the sequence drives the ending. The tightening is meaningful—she moves from passive keeper to active cartographer—and the cost is visible in the phrase "subjective years to calculate the delicate maneuvers" and the station's groan. Escalation reads cleanly under the Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the core problem. One micro-weakness: the "alignment was perfect" phrase borders on convenience without prior setup of what perfection would require.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the compass rose's shift from "decoration" to "reminder to always seek orientation" and the family custom reweighted as "a key, a way to see the universe through layers of time." The new star as "true north for a new era" integrates the core concept without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence-breaking hum and the insistent ping, which imply reconnection rather than stating it. The final image—hand over compass, sketch complete—offers a resonant answer to the question of how to navigate displacement. One slip: "she had turned confusion into a map, and the map into a way forward" summarizes the thematic arc in near-prompt language rather than letting the image carry it alone, lowering the score from high-8 range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Distance is controlled, though phrases like "a blessed pariah" and "temporally stretched" read more as authorial glosses than as her specific perceptual signature. Diction is generally consistent with a celestial cartographer's lexicon ("gilded compass rose applique," "coordinate," "dilation field"), but occasional slips into elevated register ("echoed silence deepened, now filled with the pressure of revelation") feel slightly imposed. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the glimpse beat and the final sequence. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short fragments during the surge, longer syntax during reflection—supporting the escalation without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high; causality tracks across beats. Information density is strong in the middle third (sketch → coordinate → alignment → engine sequence). Two recurring issues lower the score: stock metaphor strings ("ghosts of protocol," "tether to a linear time," "knot around her") and near-paraphrase loops ("The echoed silence of the deck deepened, now filled with the pressure of revelation" closely restates the opening's "bubble of echoed silence"). Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "She was no longer...she was..." Toggle phrasing recurs: "no longer just a keeper...a cartographer again," "confusion into a map, and the map into a way forward." These artifacts do not obscure the closure beat but reduce propulsion in supporting moves, triggering a −0.8 deduction within the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. The final line's summary ("her exploration just beginning") flattens what could be a stronger image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The time-dilation premise and celestial cartography vocation combine to create a specific frame, but the isolation-plus-sketching setup echoes familiar writing templates (lone keeper, inherited custom, final act). The sketch-as-key realization and the alignment with "the Navigator's lantern" feel orchestrated rather than inevitable in hindsight; no earlier beat primes why this anniversary sketch would differ from prior millennia. The "true north" concept is signaled early and integrated thematically, but the new star's appearance via power surge reads convenient—no prior malfunction foreshadows this exact moment. Transformation of the keeper-to-cartographer arc is present but not deeply personalized; swapping names and setting would leave the emotional beats largely unchanged. The final image (hand over compass, systems waking) is competent but not memorably fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices create the key turns: cross-referencing the coordinate, repurposing the engines, and initiating the escape sequence. She is present by name in the opening, and her decision at the glimpse beat ("Clutching the compass rose, she made her choice: exploration over despair") drives the middle and ending. The "blessed pariah" label itself is ornamental—her isolation matters, but the specific duality of revered/isolated does not constrain a choice. Her agency is visible across three beats (glimpse, alignment realization, engine activation) and closure hinges on her final act. The cost (subjective years calculating, abandonment of keeper role) is tied to her choices, not to the "blessed pariah" status per se, so the character element scores for her functional role rather than the exact trait phrase.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in three beats: traced in paragraph two (inheritance anchor), clutched at the choice moment ("she made her choice"), and touched in the final image ("her hand over the compass rose"). Its meaning shifts from "decoration" to "reminder to always seek orientation," charging the closure. However, its physical properties (gilded, sewn, dull points) do not constrain a choice; it functions as symbolic anchor rather than tool. The reweighting is present but the object itself is not causally irreplaceable—a different heirloom could serve the same thematic role with minor edits. Strong setup and closure participation, but swappability and lack of mechanical constraint lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"True north" is labeled poetically in paragraph three, becomes the readout that shows the new coordinate, and is explicitly reweighted in paragraph five as "a true north for a new era, a direction home." The concept shapes stakes: her search for orientation drives the choice to escape. It alters tactics on the page—she cross-references the coordinate with her sketch to confirm alignment. The final image ties closure directly to the concept: "a way forward" echoes the directional premise. The concept is not merely thematic; it changes her options (despair → navigation) and is causally active in the alignment beat. High irreplaceability and closure linkage justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is defined in the opening ("each minute...equating to a year") and enables the key tactic: Elara uses "subjective years to calculate the delicate maneuvers needed to escape the dilation pocket." This attribute constrains her options (she is trapped by the field) and becomes her advantage (time to calculate). The trait is present in setup, drives a middle choice, and is paid off at closure when "time's knot around her" unwinds. The cost is visible: she has endured a thousand subjective years and will spend more to escape. The attribute is causally irreplaceable—without it, neither the problem nor the solution exists. No swappability; the mechanics matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glimpse of "something impossible on the true north readout: a new, vibrant coordinate" occurs mid-story and is the inciting reversal that changes Elara's options from despair to exploration. It triggers the alignment realization, the repurposing of engines, and the escape sequence. The action is dramatized on the page ("In that fleeting pulse, Elara caught a glimpse") and its consequences unfold causally. Removing the glimpse would break the plot; no other action provides the same catalyst. The action is essential across beats and directly shapes the ending when "the faint, insistent ping of the new coordinate" confirms reconnection. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is signaled in paragraph two ("honor it one last time"), enacted in paragraph three ("she began to draw"), and becomes the method that enables the key realization: "she cross-referenced the coordinate with her sketch, plotting it precisely." The custom's mechanics matter—it provides the map that reveals the alignment. However, the custom is not constrained by cost or difficulty; the act itself is smooth and meditative rather than pressured. It shapes two beats (drawing, cross-referencing) and contributes to closure by completing the sketch, but a different mapping method could serve with moderate edits. Strong involvement, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck supplies the problem (temporal trap), the resource (dormant engines and power reserves), and the tactical constraint (limited power forcing a choice to channel "the last reserves"). It is named and described in the opening, and the deck's systems are the tools Elara repurposes to escape. The setting pressures her final choice and is causally active in the ending when "the station groaned" and "systems waking from a thousand-year sleep" signal success. The observation function (watching the starfield shift) charges the final image. Removing this exact setting would require a full rewrite; generic "station" would not provide the same dilation-plus-observation duality. High necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the premise and explains Elara's isolation, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions on the page. The anniversary framing recurs (opening and paragraph two), but no live clock pressures her moves; she has subjective years to calculate and no external deadline forces the escape attempt. The shutdown is setup context rather than a tactical constraint. The ending pays off the timeframe when real-time reasserts itself, but the "after" label is swappable with "during the shutdown's aftermath" or similar phrasing. Present in setup and closure, but not causally irreplaceable or pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is stated in the opening and dramatized in the choice beat ("she made her choice: exploration over despair"). It drives the middle sequence (repurposing engines, calculating maneuvers) and is echoed in the final line ("she had turned confusion into a map, and the map into a way forward"). The desire is conflicted—despair versus exploration—and the cost (enduring isolation, risking the escape) is visible. The motivation shapes three beats and articulates the core stake. One minor slip: the final echo is summary rather than image, and the phrasing is close to the prompt's language. Strong involvement and closure linkage, but not fully irreplaceable in expression.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the opening ("bubble of echoed silence"), recurs in paragraph five ("The echoed silence of the deck deepened"), and is broken at closure ("The echoed silence finally broke, replaced by the hum of systems waking"). The tone is coherent across the piece—quiet, meditative, then shifting to charged anticipation. It modulates with pressure: deeper during the alignment realization, breaking at the ending. The tone charges the final image by contrasting silence with the hum and ping. However, "echoed silence" is somewhat generic and could be replaced with "stillness" or "quiet" with minor adjustments. Strong presence and closure participation, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
