<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the library is stated but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or meaningful internal friction. She moves through the quest with "cautious exuberance" that reads as a stable descriptor rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final moment—opening the second letter to find "Remember"—offers no visible cost or earned transformation; she simply "smiles" with "quiet confidence." No micro-choices narrow options or force trade-offs; the watch and journal are passive recording devices rather than tools that constrain her decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. Elara achieves her goal without meaningful sacrifice or transformation; the second letter's single word "Remember" does not reconfigure stakes or meaning established earlier. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words—triggering the −0.3 penalty. The drive lens is ambiguous: the propagation delays and cyclic reversals suggest a puzzle structure, but no on-page decoding choice alters her tactics or forecloses a path. The story reads as a decorated travelogue rather than a pressure-driven arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library and mist create vivid atmosphere, and the watch's reversed gears provide a recurring tactile object. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the library's "protective illusions" are mentioned but never constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is vague—shelves "stretch into infinity" without grounding her movement. The watch qualifies as micro-setting and charges the final image with its glow, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the library—is signaled early but faces no meaningful resistance. Elara arrives, decodes patterns, and exits without a single reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The "protective illusions" never materialize as obstacles. The watch's reversals and the cipher's unfolding are described rather than used to force choices under pressure. No visible price is paid; she completes her quest and smiles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"The truth is in the silence between letters" gestures at theme but emerges as a declared epiphany rather than earned insight. The unspoken-words motif recurs but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure; it remains ornamental. The final "Remember" offers no resonant reconfiguration of prior material—it simply confirms success. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also lacks a thematic question tested through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited with Elara as focalizer. Diction is consistent but generic—"cautious exuberance," "her heart swelled," "quiet confidence"—relying on stock phrasing rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative certainty matches her knowledge; no head-hopping. However, the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence stems repeat ("She documented," "She consulted," "She adjusted") without purpose. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She documented... She consulted... She realized... She adjusted" stacks across multiple beats without variation. Paraphrase loops appear ("propagation delays in the mist, which could distort time and signal" / "propagation delays; echoes of her steps returned seconds late"). Figurative language is light but generic ("her heart swelled," "waves of understanding"). Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing causality. The closure beat avoids major artifacts but the path to it is sluggish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The library-in-mist and time-reversing watch evoke familiar fantasy quest templates without transformation. The propagation-delay cipher and cyclic reversals promise freshness but remain unexplored mechanics—described rather than dramatized. Elara's veiled-dreamer archetype and the two-letters frame are competent but replaceable with minor edits. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional arc and plot would function unchanged with different proper nouns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but makes no key choices that alter tactics or cost. She observes, documents, and succeeds without conflict. Her veil is lifted once (decorative), and she "adjusts" it at the end (thematic callback without cost). She is present in the closure beat but passively receives the second letter rather than acting to reconfigure stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watch appears in three beats: acquisition, consultation during library exploration, and glowing in tandem with the library. It provides information (reversals coincide with whispers) but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off. The final glow and transition to "steady" forward movement reweight its meaning slightly, lifting it into mid-band. However, it remains a recording device rather than a tool that alters her options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is described as "cyclically reversed" and Elara "documents the patterns," but no on-page decoding choice changes her tactics or costs her anything. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a puzzle that shapes stakes. Introduced in the middle third and mentioned at closure ("gaps in meaning") without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" describes the cipher's decoding direction and the watch's gears. It is explained rather than used to enable or constrain an action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to reversal; it remains a label-only trait. Mentioned multiple times but never dramatized as a mechanic that alters her approach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Document" appears in five beats: journal before departure, noting clues, correlating patterns, filling with revelations, and becoming a guide for others at closure. It threads the arc and participates in the ending image, but the documentation itself does not force a meaningful turn or narrow options. The action is present and purposeful but ultimately replaceable with "study" or "record."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Propagation delays are signaled in the first letter, experienced as disorienting echoes, and explained as the library's communication method. Elara uses the watch to "synchronize these delays," but the mechanics remain told rather than shown as a constraint that shapes her attempts. Functional across beats but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is established early, supplies the central location, and provides the cipher and shelves she interacts with. The mist's propagation delays are explained as shaping communication. The library is present in the closure image (remains "a beacon") but does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. It functions as vivid but passive backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between two fateful letters" is signaled at the start and paid off when the second letter arrives at the end. Elara reflects on it mid-story ("between two fateful letters... the interval"). However, the span does not tighten her decisions or create urgency; time feels elastic rather than pressured. A purposeful frame that reweights meaning slightly at closure but lacks causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The desire to find the library is stated early and drives her journey. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She seeks, finds, decodes, and departs without friction between her motivation and obstacles. The ending confirms success without trade-off. Told and consistent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is declared repeatedly ("her heart swelled with cautious exuberance," "her exuberance grew, but she remained cautious," "cautious exuberance now a quiet confidence") but functions as a static label rather than modulating with pressure. Tone does not shift meaningfully at turns or charge the final image. The mechanical repetition flattens rather than textures the mood.</comment>
