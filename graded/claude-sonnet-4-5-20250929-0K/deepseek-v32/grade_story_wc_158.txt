<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is presented through poetic labels rather than contradictory impulses in action. Her "shyly unstoppable" nature is told, not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Corvin's transformation from skeptic to advocate happens off-page in summary ("He began to visit"), bypassing the earned causality needed for character change. The death and shrine denouement tells rather than shows final cost, flattening what might have been a charged renunciation or endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece compresses centuries into summary without a single continuous scene or coherent pressure window. No on-page closure unit with visible cost: Elara's death is narrated in one sentence, the shrine is reported legend, and the final image ("half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") reprises earlier phrasing without reweighting stakes or options. The orientation test fails—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, and the timeline ("One autumn night," "As years passed," "When she died") never anchors a single dramatic present. The lens cannot be inferred because no causally linked beats exist; the piece reads as thematic summary over a lifespan rather than a coherent narrative arc with escalation and turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is described lyrically but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. Sensory details (nacreous shelf, glowing lichen, iridescent light) ornament rather than pressure. The cliff, valley, and peace garden remain abstract backdrops without spatial choreography or resource stakes. No tool, body detail, or recurring object shapes a final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spreading the blossom armistice—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or narrowing options. Corvin's skepticism dissolves in one exchange with no escalation. The piece summarizes outcomes (published volume, real truces, peace gardens) rather than dramatizing a single pressure point where Elara must choose, forfeit, or endure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs within a scene; the timeline leaps across years without causal linkage or visible cost at any pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme "pain into beauty" is stated repeatedly ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "half-sung lullabies," "blossom armistice") rather than emerging from concrete action and image. The galaxy postcard's border inscription ("beauty finds its voice") moralizes rather than resonating. The ending ("centuries of longing now met centuries of healing") toggles between abstractions without a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. Thematic echo appears throughout: characters articulate thesis statements instead of living contradictions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent third-limited but relies on recycled poetic register ("reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "ensconce") that flattens under repetition. Corvin's dialogue ("Beauty is a battle fought with quiet words") reads as theme statement rather than naturalistic speech. The piece avoids head-hopping but sacrifices perceptual signature—Elara's noticing remains generically lyrical across decades. Filter verbs cluster in summary blocks ("She wondered if," "Elara felt"), dulling immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "photosynthesizing pain into beauty" and "pain-photosynthesized beauty" restate without added pressure; "reef-shadow joy" appears four times as decoration. Template cadence runs: "Her nights were endless… Her days were marked… Each dusk, she would ensconce…" Figurative language ("blooming like a rose," "words out like seeds," "river of time") stacks in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third reprises earlier phrases ("off-key wind," "half-sung lullabies") as scaffolding rather than charged callback, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—poet in fossil shell transforms pain into peace via wind-carried lullabies—synthesizes familiar tropes (reclusive artist, transformative art) without a non-obvious angle. The galaxy postcard arrives with prophetic inscription, the skeptic softens immediately, and the peace gardens replace barricades in summary, all following template beats. Emotional specificity is absent; "reef-shadow joy" and "centuries of longing" remain abstract. The story could be re-skinned with different names and setting without altering its arc, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. Her nightly readings are routine, not choices under pressure. Handing Corvin the postcard is the sole on-page action; it occurs mid-narrative without causal weight. Her death is summarized in one sentence without agency. Late-narrative summary ("she still ensconced herself") reprises behavior rather than showing decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in three beats (shelf description, handoff to Corvin, glow reveal) but is handled only once (the handoff). The border inscription is introduced late (mid-story) as convenient prophecy rather than early seed. It does not constrain a choice or enable tactics; Corvin is persuaded by Elara's words, not the postcard itself. The glow at closure is ornamental, not causally active. Swappable with any inspirational object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is named in the opening third and recurs as thematic label throughout. It shapes the ending's reported outcomes (peace gardens, truces) but does not alter on-page options or tactics in a dramatized scene. The concept is told as philosophy rather than tested in a choice with cost. Present in closure frame (legend, final image) but as echo, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the contradiction between shyness and persistence with visible cost. The handoff to Corvin could occur without this trait. Elara's behavior (publishing nothing, sending words like seeds) is told in summary rather than shown in a beat where shyness constrains and determination compensates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears in three beats (opening setup, nightly ritual, late-narrative continuation) and establishes the spatial niche where readings occur. The action enables the wind-carried lullabies but does not itself create a turn or narrowing. Removing it would require rewriting the transmission method, giving it moderate structural role. Present in closure legend but as setting echo, not decisive action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (shell acoustics, off-key wind, half-sung lullabies) and recurs in the autumn-night beat and ending legend. It transmits the poems but does not constrain attempts or force tactical adaptation. The townsfolk hear dreams, the group sings, and the legend endures—all outcomes, no problem-solving. Mechanics are vague (how does wind carry melody to dreams?); the method reads as magical convenience rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell houses Elara and amplifies her voice but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Spatial details (spiraled chambers, nacreous shelf, moss-lined niche) are scenic. The acoustics enable transmission, giving the setting functional presence in two beats (setup, nightly ritual), but it remains backdrop. Corvin's archive exploration is summarized without altering stakes. Missing closure participation as active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Centuries of longing" appears in the opening, the postcard inscription, and the ending as thematic phrase but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The story spans Elara's lifetime in summary with no tracked urgency. The autumn night is one moment; "years passed" compresses without pressure. Time is ornamental, not a constraint that narrows tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated three times (opening, mid-story summary, late collective alchemy) but never dramatized as conflicted choice. Elara's insomnia and solitude are backdrop, not friction that forces a tradeoff. The desire drives her routine (nightly readings) but no on-page beat shows her weighing pain's cost against beauty's reward. Told-only, label-level presence without choice architecture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is a recurring phrase (four mentions) used to label tone rather than modulate it under pressure. It appears in moments of gladness (opening description, autumn-night surge, shell hum, ending legend) but does not shift or charge the final image with new weight. The tone remains static dappled-melancholy across the arc. Functional as atmospheric label, but lacks dynamic range or closure intensification.</comment>
