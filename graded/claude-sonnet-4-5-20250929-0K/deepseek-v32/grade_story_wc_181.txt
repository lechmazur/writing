<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's trajectory from bewilderment to acceptance is legible but relies heavily on a single bathroom epiphany that feels unearned—no prior micro-choices build the realization that "asking is the answer." Interior voice veers into abstract philosophizing ("nonlinear inheritance meant knowledge arrived in fragments") without embodied contradiction or struggle. The cameo activation and visions provide exposition rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The ending renunciation (sustaining wonder vs. solving mystery) lands thematically but lacks visible cost because Aris was already performing the task.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring motifs (orchard, cameo, logbook) and a cadence shift at the bathroom breakthrough. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the forbidden knowledge reweights as "the asking itself"—but the cost remains abstract and conceptual rather than felt or visible on the page (no tactic change, no foreclosed option). The bathroom turn is asserted rather than built through prior pressure, weakening the "because/therefore" even under an accumulative reading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly rendered with synaptic blooms and pulsing light, and the pistachio shell cameo carries tactile detail (cold, smooth). The bathroom as a site of breakthrough is spatially anchored but feels arbitrary—sterile walls "focused his mind" without prior setup. Micro-setting qualifies (cameo, orchard bloom) and the cameo constrains a choice (pressing it triggers visions), lifting the score above mid-band. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aris presses the cameo and receives visions, but this resolves immediately without complication or trade-off. The bathroom realization feels like a shortcut rather than a pressure point; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Coincidence (cosmic chance inheritance) sets up the cameo rather than protagonist agency driving escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase is present but the cost at closure is conceptual, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: inheritance as network, questions over answers, the orchard as a library of doubt. The bathroom epiphany risks becoming a thematic statement ("the asking itself") but is anchored to the cameo's activation. The final image—cameo on pedestal, orchard blossoming—offers resonance without moralizing. However, the piece edges into philosophizing ("forbidden knowledge was not a secret to own, but a process to join") that borders on thesis articulation rather than embodied discovery. No clear counter-reading or ambiguity remains at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, maintains stable distance. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("brightened disquiet," "simply complicated") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak—Aris notices in generalities (blossoms, light, whispers) without idiosyncratic bias. The phrase "brightened disquiet" recurs as a motif but reads ornamental rather than psychologically grounded. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Numerous paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "perpetual blossom-light" / "eternal, astral light"; "simply complicated" appears three times without fresh context; "between the first and last page" recurs four times mechanically. Template cadence runs ("He spoke... he retreated... He returned... He placed") stack without variation. The phrase "brightened disquiet" appears five times, shifting from fresh coinage to tic. Stock metaphors ("library of lived questions," "beacon of luminous uncertainty") pile up in the final third. Figurative density in low-pressure transit beats (orchard description, logbook references) slows momentum. These artifacts pervade but do not obscure causality, so penalties route here. Applying baseline −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for synonym churn, and −0.5 for stock metaphor strings in the final third totals approximately −1.8, but capping cumulative non-closure artifact penalty at −1.5 per guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard premise and nonlinear inheritance offer a fresh synthesis, and the bathroom-as-portal is a non-obvious detail. However, the emotional arc (bewilderment → epiphany → acceptance) follows a familiar template, and the core insight (questions matter more than answers) is a well-worn trope in speculative meditation. The pistachio shell cameo and synaptic blooms provide specificity, but the piece does not transform the "cosmic librarian" or "eternal question" archetypes in a way that feels indispensable. The bathroom turn is memorable but not structurally necessary—the same realization could occur at the orchard's heart. No bold risk that heightens stakes; the ending settles into safety rather than confronting ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris makes two on-page decisions: speaking into the cameo (which fails) and pressing it against the bloom (which succeeds). The bathroom retreat is observation leading to realization rather than a constrained choice. "Bewildered" is asserted at the start and resolved at the end, but the arc is told more than shown through micro-choices. Swappable with "hesitant keeper" or "uncertain steward" without major edits. Present in setup, middle (cameo use), and payoff (acceptance), meeting two gates, but causal pressure is low. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (acceptance stance) +0.7, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental "bewildered" label −0.3 yield ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears in four beats: initial holding, inquiry attempt, bathroom realization (mental reference), bloom activation, and final pedestal placement. It is handled on the page, its blankness is thematically charged, and it gains Aris's etched face at closure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (etched face, pedestal) +1.2, specificity (pistachio shell, blankness as mirror) +0.5, cost connection (personal imprint required) +0.4. No major frictions. Total ~6.8; the cameo is essential but does not drive a live choice with felt trade-off, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is named repeatedly and shapes the cameo's passage ("not from parent to child, but across random generations"). It appears in setup (heirloom description), middle (bathroom epiphany about fragments), and payoff (logbook entry, future inheritors). However, it functions more as theme than stake—no on-page choice hinges on inheritance being nonlinear vs. linear. Early signal +0.5, three thematic beats +1.0, closure linkage (future inheritors, network) +0.8, but swappability (could be "timeless" or "cyclical" knowledge) −0.6 and summary-only integration −0.5 yield ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" is stated three times (orchard task, truth, duty) but never constrains an on-page action or enables a tactic with visible cost. It is a label describing the paradox of tending infinite branches in finite space, yet Aris's daily work is not dramatized. Setup +0.3, thematic echo in middle and end +0.6, but label-only use −0.6, swappability (could be "paradoxical" or "contradictory") −0.5, and no causal pressure −0.8 yield ~3.8, capped at 3.8 per swappability guidance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Inquire" drives two beats: speaking questions into the cameo (fails) and pressing the cameo against the bloom (succeeds, triggering visions). The bathroom breakthrough is reflection rather than inquiry. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (visions shape acceptance) +0.9, causal pressure (inquiry method changes) +0.7. But the action is conceptually swappable with "seek" or "commune" −0.5, yielding ~5.7. Inquiry shapes attempts but does not redefine options with felt cost, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method appears in one beat: the bathroom retreat and sterile-wall epiphany. Setup is absent (no prior bathroom use or hint), development occurs mid-story, and payoff is referenced in the logbook ("bathrooms can be portals") but not shown. Late first appearance (second third) −0.4, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (logbook entry) +0.5, ornamental mention (portal claim) −0.5, and resolves a problem it did not create (the epiphany) −0.7. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; total ~4.9 without the cap, so 4.6 applies, but rounding to 4.9 for one-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard is present throughout: Aris tends it, the blooms hold knowledge, the central bloom activates the cameo, and the orchard nods in agreement at the end. Early signal +0.6, three beats (tending, bloom activation, final nod) +1.4, closure linkage (blooms pulse brighter, agree) +1.0, causal pressure (bloom enables visions) +0.8, specificity (synaptic, luminous) +0.5. But the orchard does not pressure a choice with cost—it provides exposition (visions) rather than constraining tactics. Subtract −0.4 for postcard layering in non-pressure beats. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" recurs four times, framing the logbook and Aris's stewardship window. Setup +0.3, thematic echo in middle and end +0.6, closure linkage (logbook entry) +0.5. But the timeframe is vague (no ticking clock, no deadline pressure) and does not alter tactics or tighten decisions. Swappable with "during his tenure" −0.6, label-only −0.4. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; actual ~3.6 fits. Rounding down: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is stated early and sustained through the cameo inquiry and bloom activation. Setup +0.5, two beats (cameo attempts) +0.9, closure linkage (forbidden knowledge reweighted as asking) +0.9. But the pursuit is frictionless—no cost trade-off dramatized, no competing want (e.g., safety vs. knowledge). Told motivation without visible want/fear conflict −0.6, summary integration −0.4. Total ~5.4. The realization lands but the pursuit itself does not create a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears five times, framing Aris's emotional state from start to end. Setup +0.5, recurs in middle and end +0.8, closure linkage (settles into steady glow) +0.7. But the tone is static—disquiet neither modulates under pressure nor charges the final image with fresh tension. It is described rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm. Label-only use −0.5, ornamental repetition −0.3. Total ~4.7. The phrase is present but does not shape how pressure reads on the page.</comment>
