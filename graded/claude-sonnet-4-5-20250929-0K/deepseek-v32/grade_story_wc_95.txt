<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation ("turn questions into destinations") is stated but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. His mechanical arm functions as stage dressing rather than embodied constraint. The tin card's personal history is told, not enacted through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Elara enters too late to establish relationship pressure; their "lifelong dialectic" exists only in exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal-Situational hybrid; orientation anchors by line 1 (who/where/when). The sundial decode provides causal machinery, but the reversal—duel to shared journey—lands abruptly without visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The closure reads as mutual discovery rather than a choice that alters stakes. Cost is conceptual (philosophical reconciliation) but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, sundial, and scattered papers establish controlled disorder early. The half-painted sundial constrains the decode action and charges the departure. Spatial choreography (circling, blade meeting stone, card clattering) remains clear. The setting enables rather than pressures; no environmental feature forces a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is framed as philosophical conflict, but the duel pauses without visible cost when the card falls—a truce without forfeiture. The sundial's coordinates are revealed via statement, not earned struggle. The resolution grants both characters their goal (archive access together) with no dramatized trade-off or narrowed option. One tightening (duel-to-journey shift) occurs but lacks an on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Turn questions into destinations" is repeated as a thematic claim rather than emergent from conflict. The needle card's symbolic weight (unbroken thread) is stated by Elara, not discovered through image. The ending offers partnership as answer without ambiguity or felt complexity. The sundial cipher and the atrium's "dignified chaos" gesture toward theme but resolve into tidy agreement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Alistair. Psychic distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated but uniform across stress levels; no rhythm modulation under duel pressure. Dialogue ("Your punctuality is as expected") reads formal but lacks subtext or goal pursuit—lines declare rather than evade. Elara's voice mirrors Alistair's register without distinction. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paragraph rhythm varies; sentences open cleanly. Minor template cadence: "His eyes drifted… His mind… His rival…" across three beats. The phrase "diplomatically fierce" recurs identically (Alistair's attribute, then Elara's tone) without variation—synonym churn. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks. Information density is moderate; many lines advance setting or action. "Dignified chaos" appears three times with diminishing specificity. Deduct −0.4 cumulative for template stems and label repetition in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise (philosopher-duelists decode sundial to find archive) is functional but reads as prompt assembly: mechanical arm, tin card, coded sundial, glass atrium stack without organic synthesis. The duel-to-partnership turn is signaled early and unfolds predictably. "Diplomatically fierce" is used identically for both characters, flattening distinction. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; emotional beats follow expected arcs. Swappability test: names and setting could change with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Alistair appears throughout; his philosophical trade and duel stance frame the opening. The mechanical arm is mentioned in five beats (resting, flexing, hydraulics in riposte) but functions decoratively—no choice hinges on its limits or capabilities. His decision to reveal the sundial's coordinates and lower his blade are key turns, but neither is constrained by his specific attributes as dueling philosopher. Present in closure (departure) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Danish tin card appears in four beats: withdrawn and examined (tactile anchor), falls during duel (pause catalyst), identified as Elara's token, handed back at closure. The card triggers the truce and is named as a symbol of unbroken connection. Its return charges the final exchange. However, it resolves a thematic question it did not help create earlier; its pledge history is told, not enacted. Two gates solid (setup, closure participation); middle beat is reactive rather than enabling a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hidden overture" is decoded from the sundial and revealed as an invitation to journey rather than duel. It shapes the ending's reframe but is delivered via summary ("The hidden overture was now clear") rather than enacted pressure. Introduced at the ~60% mark when Alistair calculates; does not constrain earlier tactics. The concept reweights the premise at closure but arrives through explanation. Cap for late arrival (after 40%) at 4.6; lift +0.6 for closure linkage and thematic charge to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is stated as Alistair's attribute and then applied identically to Elara's tone—label repetition without distinct embodiment. No on-page moment where this trait constrains a choice or forces a visible trade-off. The dual application flattens rather than sharpens character. Mentioned but not dramatized. Cap for ornamental use and swappability at 3.8; small lift for dual textual presence to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fencing appears in six beats: solo practice motions, Elara's entrance with foil, blades meet, whirlwind duel, parry-and-pivot, desperate riposte, then lowered blade. The action drives the middle sequence and the pause (card fall) triggers the turn. The duel itself does not resolve the conflict—revelation does—so fencing is essential to structure but not to closure logic. Strong beat involvement and causal role in the turn; not indispensable to the ending (coordinates could be revealed another way).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial introduced at ~35%, described as cipher, then decoded to yield coordinates. Alistair's calculation is summarized ("he calculated, his mind translating angles into instructions") rather than shown. The method shapes the middle reveal and is named at closure ("the sundial's angles point northeast"). Two gates: middle development (decode action) and closure participation (Elara's acknowledgment). Missing early setup; introduced after first third. Cap for late arrival at 4.6; lift +1.8 for causal linkage and closure specificity to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Glass atrium with brook, vines, stone table, gravel path established in opening lines. The setting hosts all action, provides the sundial centerpiece, and witnesses the departure. Spatial choreography (stone floor pivot, card clattering) is clear. The brook's "quiet" bookends the piece. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics; the setting enables rather than pressures. Three gates present; strong setup and closure participation; causal role is atmospheric rather than tactical. High functional integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"While waiting" frames the opening; Alistair waits for Elara, who arrives midway. Time is marked by light shift on the sundial ("As the light shifted, he calculated"). The duel and conversation occur in continuous real time. Waiting ends explicitly at closure ("their waiting ended and their travel began"). The timeframe shapes pacing and the sundial's function but does not tighten a decision or create tactical urgency. Two gates solid (setup, closure); middle use is scenic rather than pressuring. Lift for thematic charge in final line.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations" is stated twice: once as Alistair's framing motivation, once as closing exchange. The desire drives the archive quest conceptually but is not tested by conflicting wants on the page. No moment where this motivation forces a visible cost or trade-off. The needle card and sundial serve this motive thematically but do not dramatize friction between want and obstacle. Three gates present (setup, middle thematic claim, closure echo) but told rather than enacted under pressure. Lyric reprise lifts score within the told-only band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is named three times: atrium description, duel sequence, resolution sentence. The tone coheres as formal restraint amid potential violence. Diction remains elevated throughout; no modulation during the duel's physical peak. The oxymoron charges the setting and ending image but does not shift with pressure. Coherent across beats and integral to thematic closure; however, static application (no tonal turn that reweights the stake). Strong thematic fit but not dynamically deployed.</comment>
