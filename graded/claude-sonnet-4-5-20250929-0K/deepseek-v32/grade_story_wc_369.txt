<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's interior is concrete and character-specific: his "quiet obsession" over years of listening shapes his method. The healing-scar detail is embodied but remains ornamental—it does not constrain a choice. The vision at the yew tree arrives without prior micro-choices that dramatize internal conflict; the protagonist witnesses rather than struggles. The final "sharing the witness" reads passive, an acceptance that forecloses no live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas achieves his goal ("quantified sorrow…gently faded to zero") through witnessing, reweighting his method from mapping-to-release to listening-for-letting-go. The "pin is heard" moment functions as a micro turn that realigns the scattered dreams, teaching Silas the missing key. Cost is implied—years of listening, the shift in method—but the final image does not make a felt sacrifice or foreclosed path undeniable on the page. The accumulative lens holds; the sextant reading spike and the vision at the tree create one meaningful deepening, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, moonlight's "cool tingle," and the labyrinth below are vividly anchored early. The broken sextant and the yew tree function as micro-settings that constrain Silas's method and deliver the closure vision. Sensory selection reflects urgency: during the pin's "metallic ping," silence is foregrounded; moonlight charges both the healing and the dream-mist visibility. The tower-to-labyrinth descent is spatially coherent and the yew tree's gnarled bark is handled tactilely in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—releasing the labyrinth's absorbed sorrows—is signaled early. The "pin is heard" micro turn tightens by revealing that mapping alone is insufficient; listening for "moments of letting go" narrows tactics. The sextant spike and the rush down the stairs create accumulative pressure. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is passive witness rather than renunciation or decision with visible cost; Silas "simply stood, sharing the witness," and the sorrow fades without a dramatized trade-off or foreclosed alternative on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing without judgment as release—emerges from the yew's vision of the astronomer and guard rather than assertion. The "mundane miracle" frame recurs purposefully at open and close, charging the final zero-reading. "Quantified sorrow" risks prompt-echo abstraction but remains grounded in the sextant's mechanical clicks and the mist's visual presence. The ending offers a resonant answer (witnessing completes the release) without a stated moral. Minor slip: "what trees witness" is told as obsession but the vision sequence remains slightly expository rather than fully enacted choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance tightens cleanly during the pin moment and the yew vision. Perceptual signature is specific: Silas notices pruning scars, tarnished brass, dream-mist patterns. Diction ("stormlit," "bramble-choked alcove," "pearlescent light") fits a poetic maintenance-worker idiom without register drift. No dialogue. The vision sequence uses free-indirect knowing ("he saw…he saw") that compresses centuries without head-hopping. Minor template cadence in the yew-vision beat ("He saw…He saw…") but it reads purposeful, rhythmic rather than artificial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high: "the astronomer's broken sextant…its brass tarnished, its index mirror shattered. It was useless for navigating by stars, but he had found another use for it" economically establishes prop history and repurposed function. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language ("dream-mist," "quantified sorrow") recurs but remains legible and purpose-driven. The pin's "metallic ping" and the vision's "knowing" are vivid and concise. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—broken navigational tool repurposed to measure emotional echoes, moonlight-triggered healing, labyrinth as repository of regrets—feels specific and non-obvious. The "pin is heard" turn is fresh: a tiny mechanical release becomes the key to aligning scattered dreams. Risk: the accumulative, contemplative frame with a passive witness-protagonist in a lyric fantasy register. The yew-vision particulars (astronomer weeping, guard's dropped pin) avoid stock emotion and lend the premise lived texture. Swappability test passes: mapping quantified sorrow via broken sextant in moonlight is integral, not skin over a generic plot.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his goal (release labyrinth sorrows) frames all beats. He handles the sextant, takes readings, rushes down the stairs, and places his hand on the yew. However, his final act is passive witness rather than a decision that alters tactics with cost. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (witnessing completes the goal) +1.0, but passivity at closure and lack of visible choice-driven cost cap the score. Late transformation without prior micro-choices under pressure limits causal pressure credit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph two (history, mechanics), paragraph three (Silas picks it up, points it, takes readings), paragraph five (dial spike), and is implied present at closure (dial fades to zero). Four beats, early signal, causal pressure (its spike reveals the alignment), closure linkage (the zero-reading confirms release). Specificity: broken index mirror, tarnished brass, clicking gears—irreplaceable details. Minor friction: the final fade-to-zero is asserted rather than shown as a tactile reading moment. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" is named in paragraph three, operationalized via sextant readings (7.3 units, 2.1 units), and the spike/alignment moment in paragraph five. At closure, the dial "gently faded to zero," completing the arc. Two beats (reading, spike, fade), early signal, closure linkage. However, the concept remains slightly abstract—a label for the mist rather than a mechanic that forces a tactical trade-off. The cost (years of listening, method shift) is told, not shown as a choice constrained by the quantified measure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" appears once in paragraph one: the pruning scar aches by day, softens in moonlight. The trait is embodied and specific but does not constrain or enable any later choice. It enriches atmosphere and Silas's relationship with moonlight but could be removed without altering plot, stakes, or closure. Present by setup gate, absent from middle development and closure participation. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Deconstruct the labyrinth's hold" is stated as Silas's goal in paragraph three and frames his charting method. The rush down the stairs and the hand-on-bark vision enact discovery of the hold's source (the yew absorbing sorrows). The pin-moment turn teaches him that mapping must pair with listening. Two beats (goal stated, vision enacted), early signal, closure linkage (the zero-reading confirms deconstruction succeeded). However, "deconstruct" is abstract; the mechanics (witness = release) remain told rather than shown as a costly choice. Swappable with "release" or "resolve" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is introduced paragraph three, demonstrated via sextant readings and wax-tablet notation in paragraph four, and reweighted in paragraph five when mapping alone proves insufficient—listening for the pin completes the method. Three beats, early signal, causal pressure (the spike shows dreams aligning), closure linkage (the method succeeds when witness is added). Mechanics are shown on the page: sextant measures mist, tablet records units. Minor friction: the shift from mapping to listening+mapping is asserted in Silas's realization rather than tested through a failed attempt with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tower is anchored immediately ("stormlit tower…presided over [the labyrinth's] heart"), provides moonlight that enables sextant readings, and the stairwell channels the pin's sound. The descent in paragraph six uses the tower's spatial structure. Closure occurs at the yew in the labyrinth below, making the tower a launch point rather than the ending's setting. Setup and middle development gates met; closure participation indirect (the tower's height and stairwell funnel the pin sound). Solid integration but the labyrinth-heart and yew do heavier lifting at closure. "Stormlit" and "pearlescent light" charge atmosphere without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pin's "metallic ping" arrives at paragraph five, exactly when "absolute quiet" makes it audible—time contracts to a hinge moment. The timeframe tightens Silas's realization ("The sound was a key") and propels the immediate descent. Early middle placement, causal pressure (the sound triggers the spike and the alignment), closure linkage (the pin's release is echoed in the guard's vision, completing the thematic circuit). Specificity: "the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor" is irreplaceable. The beat is dramatized, not summarized. Strong integration; the timeframe constrains perception and drives the turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" is named in paragraph two as Silas's "quiet obsession" grown over years. It frames his unofficial work and is paid off in the yew-vision paragraph six, where he sees the astronomer and guard and understands the tree "holding these silent stories without judgment." Setup and closure gates met; middle development is implicit (the mapping method serves the goal). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No visible friction between desire and cost on the page; Silas's discovery arrives as vision-gift, not earned struggle. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Mundane miracle" appears in paragraph one (the healing scar) and paragraph seven (closure: "another mundane miracle, complete"). The tone is consistent: quiet, wonder-tinged pragmatism pervades the sextant's mechanics, the dream-mist imagery, and the yew-vision sequence. The oxymoron "mundane miracle" charges both ordinary details (moss-clogged drains, whetstone) and numinous moments (moonlight healing, quantified sorrow) without tonal whiplash. The final line recharges the opening frame, creating a purposeful envelope. Tone modulates subtly with the storm/moonlight shift and the pin's silence but never breaks voice. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
