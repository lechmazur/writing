<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Aris's motivation is clearly signaled early and shapes his actions throughout, but his interiority remains somewhat abstract—"calmly inventive" and "methodical patience" are asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to distribute copies is causally earned, but the emotional stakes feel muted; we see his duty transform but don't witness genuine internal conflict or cost in the moment of decision. The piece would benefit from showing him wrestle with fear, doubt, or the weight of potential consequences rather than operating with untroubled competence.</comment>

<comment>The causal lens holds cleanly: blackout → archive access → transcription → distribution plan. Orientation is anchored early (Fort, Aris, blackout, his role). The closure—Aris returning to his post with hidden pages—functions as Charged Poise: options are crystallized (he will distribute the truths) and the revolutionary stakes are reconfigured, though the felt cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial mechanism opens the archive, narrowing his path forward.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The luminous Fort, the half-painted sundial, and the bronze quill holder all function as tools that constrain and enable Aris's choices. The blackout removes the usual light-lock mechanism and forces reliance on the sundial's coded grooves, and the quill holder's hollow interior becomes essential for concealing transcriptions. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action—twilight geometry, spark-traces, the scratch of nib on paper—and the Fort's return to light at the end charges the final image by hiding the sundial's code again.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution by revealing historical truth—is signaled early and drives Aris's actions throughout. The blackout provides the tightening: it removes the usual barrier and creates urgency. The cost, however, is more conceptual than visceral; Aris operates with calm competence rather than visible risk or tradeoff on the page. A stronger score would require on-page friction—fear of discovery, a near-miss, or a sacrifice that alters his tactics in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between the Keepers' monopolized light and Aris's effort to illuminate hidden truths—"two lights" is earned rather than stated as thesis. The sundial, quill holder, and spark-cradle motifs recur with reweighted meaning at closure: the Fort's sterile light returns and "hides its codes once more," while Aris carries a "warm" cylinder of transcribed fire. The final image offers a resonant answer—revolution as patient dissemination rather than violent rupture—without moralizing, and the piece resists neat resolution by keeping the outcome open.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Aris; distance remains consistent and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register—"winking hush," "held breath," "cradle of sparks"—that fits the tale's quiet, deliberate tone. However, some diction choices feel slightly ornate for the POV's urgency ("bestowal," "methodical patience"), and the narrative voice occasionally tilts toward exposition ("His true motivation, long nurtured") rather than embodied perception. Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for a solitary intrigue.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is generally clear with high information density—most lines advance action, setting, or stakes. However, several beats carry mild overwriting: "the tone of the evening one of winking hush" is abstract, and "silent revolution" appears three times without fresh variation. The phrase "cradle of sparks" recurs but shifts meaning, which is purposeful, yet clusters of elevated diction ("resonant click," "sterile light") in the final third slow momentum slightly. No outright loops or template cadence, but tighter compression would elevate propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—using a blackout to access forbidden archives via a sundial's hidden code—offers a fresh synthesis of light-based worldbuilding and quiet resistance. The combination of flint-and-iron sparks, coded grooves, and a quill holder as secret vessel feels specific and earned rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (dutiful sentinel becomes revolutionary) follows a familiar trajectory without surprising inflection, and the final image, while resonant, is somewhat anticipated. The piece commits fully to its concept and avoids safety-hedging, but lacks a bold risk or non-obvious turn that would push it into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Aris, the vigilant lock sentinel, drives every key turn: he moves through the Fort, decodes the sundial, ignites sparks, opens the archive, transcribes records, and plans distribution. His role is essential to the story's logic and closure—without his specific position and access, none of the intrigue occurs. Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, and direct shaping of the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The bronze quill holder appears in at least four beats: carried for comfort, used to store flint and iron, holds the hidden nib and ink, and finally conceals the transcribed pages. Its hollow interior is causally essential—sparking the lock and smuggling the revolution's "fire." Early setup, repeated functional use, and it charges the final image ("warm, full of a fire"). Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"The cradle of sparks" is introduced at the sundial's gnomon, where Aris strikes flint and iron to trace the coded grooves and unlock the archive. It recurs in the final paragraph as a metaphor for the revolution ("its first cradle of sparks now carried safely"). Setup and closure participation are present, and it enables the central action, but mid-story it functions more as method than recurring stake-shaper. Solid causal role, lyric reprise, but not indispensable across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted early ("He was calmly inventive, his mind already turning the crisis into opportunity") and reflected in his use of the sundial and quill holder, but the trait is more labeled than dramatically tested. We see competence rather than visible cost or tradeoff tied to this specific attribute. Functional but could be replaced with "resourceful" or "patient" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Intrigue is the dominant action: Aris decodes the sundial, unlocks the archive, reads forbidden records, transcribes truths, and plans to distribute them in public spaces. Every major turn traces to this action, and the ending's stakes (silent revolution via shared knowledge) depend entirely on it. Early framing, sustained pressure, and closure linkage. Removing intrigue would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The coded angles in the half-painted sundial are introduced early, explained as Aris's key insight ("the missing paint was not neglect, but a code"), and their mechanics matter on the page: he traces their geometry with twilight, strikes sparks in the grooves, and the spark-map leads to the physical lock. The method is specific, causally essential, and irreplaceable—no generic lockpick could substitute. Strong setup, mid-story use, and direct enablement of the archive breach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The luminous Fort at twilight provides both the inciting condition (unexplained blackout removes light-locks) and a constraining resource (last ember of twilight lets Aris trace the sundial's geometry). The Fort's spatial details—central archive, antechamber, western wall—anchor action clearly, and the return of luminescence at the end hides the sundial's codes again, charging the closure image. Early setup, causal pressure on tactics, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The unexplained blackout is the inciting event, removes the usual light-lock barrier, creates urgency ("the blackout was his signal to begin"), and brackets the entire action—Aris finishes transcriptions "as the first faltering flicker" returns. Time pressure is legible: he must work before power is restored. The blackout's end resets the Fort's defenses, adding stakes. Early signal, sustained constraint, and shapes the ending's timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The desire "to spark a silent revolution against the Keepers" is stated early and drives every choice: accessing the archive, reading forbidden records, transcribing truths, and planning distribution. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through internal friction—Aris operates without visible doubt or cost in the moment. Strong causal role and closure linkage, but the want-versus-fear tension remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"Winking hush" is named once early ("the tone of the evening one of winking hush") and reflected in descriptions like "practiced silence," "soft scratch of nib on paper," and "quiet nod of understanding." The tone is coherent and modulates appropriately—tension without panic, resolution without fanfare—and the final image of Aris as "a mask of quiet duty" reinforces it. However, the phrase itself is somewhat abstract and does not recur with reweighted force at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
