<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or internal conflict. Her "earnestly studious" nature reads as a static label without embodied contradiction—she performs the same ritual at dawn with no friction, mistake, or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The emotional progression is flat: she begins contemplative, remains contemplative, and closes contemplative, with no layered or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Agency is absent; she executes a procedural task without a choice that forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens but never delivers a meaningful cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with cost. Orientation is established (who, where, when by ~120 words), but the ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing: Elara "descended, carrying the textures" is a spatial move without consequence or reweighted meaning. The closure beat simply resets to the initial state ("she would return"), creating a loop rather than a legible before/after with felt or conceptual cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent lamp are visually rendered and spatially coherent, but they function as static backdrop rather than constraint or resource. The setting does not pressure a single choice or alter tactics; Elara performs her ritual unimpeded. The final image ("mountaintop bonsai forests waited") is descriptive repetition without reweighted charge. Micro-setting (lamp, workbench, notepad) is present but ornamental, never shaping an action with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to collect temporal textures—is stated early but never faces opposition, complication, or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the lamp hums, she charts, she records, she descends. Coincidence does not complicate; luck does not intervene; there is no escalation under any lens. The ending resets to the initial condition without a trade-off, loss, or foreclosed path. Pressure is declared ("the pivotal moment when night yielded to day") but remains abstract and untested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (time, history, empathetic reconstruction) is announced through exposition rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. "Invented histories were not falsehoods but empathetic reconstructions" is a meta-commentary that replaces scene work. The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighted resonance; it loops back to "tomorrow, after the town went silent, she would return," a stasis without cost. Subtext is minimal; every symbolic element (gilded-leaf, bonsai, fluorescent hum) is explained on the page, leaving nothing for inference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent (she notices textures, hums, light). However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("empathetic reconstructions of possible pasts," "incandescent restraint") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("believed she could," "felt a surge") dull immediacy in several beats. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains steady but does not modulate with pressure because no pressure exists. Voice is coherent but generic, lacking the idiosyncratic rhythm or lexicon that would distinguish this focalizer under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Her motivation was simple yet profound" / "Her method was precise"; "The bonsai forests seemed to breathe" / "The blooming labyrinth stood as a witness"; "She had collected another layer" / "enriching her invented histories" restate the same concept across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without payoff: "gilded-leaf," "blooming labyrinth," "temporal textures," "incandescent restraint" stack decoratively. Sentence openings repeat ("Elara [verb]" x6; "The [noun]" x5). Momentum stalls in mid-section expository blocks that summarize rather than advance. Apply −1.0 for loops and scaffold spread, −0.4 for template cadence, cap reduced by cumulative artifact presence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—a stationer collects time-textures via dawn-lamp-hum—is conceptually inventive but executed through static ritual rather than dramatized transformation. The ending loops to the opening without fresh inflection or earned reversal; "she would return" negates any sense of change. Transformation test fails: swap "time-textures" for "dream-fragments" and the emotional arc (none) and plot (unchanged stasis) remain identical. No bold risk or unconventional perspectival choice heightens stakes; the piece ornaments a premise without testing it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the charting ritual, but her choices are procedural (switch lamp, mark notepad) without alternatives or cost. No key turn traces to her agency; she completes the task as planned and descends. Observation-only beats dominate; no decision alters tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The notepad appears in beats 3, 11, 14, 17, 23, 30, 43—handled repeatedly. However, it remains a passive repository: she opens it, marks it, closes it. No evolution in its use or reweighted meaning at closure; the "battered binding a record of countless dawns" is static description. Present across beats but never constrains a choice or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Invented histories" is named and explained (lines 18–19) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elara imagines monks' hands and a bustling market, but these are summary reconstructions without friction or cost. The concept is thematic echo, not causal driver; swappable with "collected memories" or "recorded dreams" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is declared (line 2) and echoed ("Her earnestly studious approach," line 37) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No trade-off between studiousness and speed, risk, or social connection. Label-only; no visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Refract" is the named action, defined (line 16), and repeated (lines 10, 15, 21, 40, 46). It shapes the middle ritual beats—she refracts dawn hum into textures—but the action itself is effortless and unopposed. No turn depends on refraction failing or succeeding differently; easily swappable with "transmute" or "distill." Present and functional, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The lamp-hum method is signaled early (line 9) and its mechanics detailed (lines 12–15, 20, 29). It structures the middle beats as she charts fluctuations. However, the method never encounters resistance or surprise; it works as expected, then stops. The hum shapes one sequence but not a turn or cost; mechanics are procedural rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is established early (lines 1, 5–6) and anchors spatial continuity. It provides atmosphere ("gnarled trunks," "blooming") and houses the workbench, but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Postcard-level description; the setting waits passively rather than complicating or enabling tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" opens and closes the piece, framing the vigil. However, the timeframe imposes no urgency or tracked deadline. Dawn arrives on schedule; Elara completes the task without time constraint. The silence is ambient context, not a ticking clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the textures of different times" is stated (line 4) and reiterated (lines 22, 31, 33). It explains why Elara performs the ritual, but the story never dramatizes friction between want and cost, or conflicting desires. Told and static; no on-page moment where collecting competes with safety, rest, or another stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is named once (line 26) and modeled in the prose's measured pace and declarative syntax. Tone is coherent and stable—calm, contemplative—but does not modulate with pressure because no pressure exists. The final image ("And the fluorescent lamp at dawn would hum again") echoes the opening without tonal shift or charge. Static mood; no cadence break that reweights the stake.</comment>
