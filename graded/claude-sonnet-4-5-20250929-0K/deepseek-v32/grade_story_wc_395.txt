<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation (finding where deleted files go) is clear and philosophically rooted, driving her investigation. Her final choice to lie and hide the truth shows internal conflict with visible cost. However, the embodiment of her emotional state relies on stock phrases ("mind screaming," "physical weight in her chest") rather than character-particular manifestations. The supervisor Kael remains functional but one-note, present only to deliver threat without distinct pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain: pattern discovery → tracing to Voyager → excavating the truth → threat from Kael → decision to bury it deeper. Orientation anchors (archive keeper, digital necropolis, century-past social network) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Aris preserves truth by internalizing it, with the cost legible in her "brightly attentive silence" becoming a grave. The drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; the because/therefore linkage holds through the investigation, and the final image reweights her opening question about deleted files.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is vivid ("frozen river of thoughts," "data-morgue," "digital necropolis") and provides the investigative terrain. The commander's poem and the embroidered patch anchor the mystery with tactile specificity. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; spatial choreography (cold corridors, terminals, buried zones) does not constrain a key choice. The recurring numbers and metadata details are atmospheric but do not alter Aris's tactics—she moves through the archive without environmental friction shaping her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expose or protect the truth—is signaled early and escalates through discovery, threat, and final choice. The tightening is visible: Aris moves from curiosity to possession of proof to survival calculus. The cost is clear: she saves the truth by becoming its sole keeper, accepting silence and professional risk. However, the escalation is largely linear; Kael's threat arrives as external pressure rather than a reversal born from Aris's prior choices, reducing agency in the peak turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—what happens to deleted memories and the cost of bearing witness—emerges organically from the investigation and closure. The final image ("they went into the keepers who chose to remember") answers the opening question without moralizing, reweighting the archive from necropolis to living grave. The commander's poem, the patch, and the sensed absence function as motifs that accumulate meaning rather than ornament. The piece resists tidy resolution: the cold case is "not solved, but no longer alone," embracing meaningful ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-limited on Aris with controlled distance. Diction is generally voice-consistent ("brightly attentive gaze," "silent ghost in the machine"), though some phrases drift toward elevated register ("fractured story," "terrible truth") during peak beats. Kael's dialogue ("Some memories are best left formatted") carries subtext and threat efficiently. However, perceptual signature is not strongly character-particular; Aris's way of noticing reads competent but not idiosyncratic, and the prose rhythm does not modulate distinctly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear with purposeful compression in places ("pulsed softly across the echo of forgotten songs"). However, several patterns reduce density: paraphrase loops appear ("The official record showed... The corporate line was..." restate the same cover-up; "a void that hummed louder" then "sensed absence" recycle the same concept). Template cadence runs through expository beats ("It was a string of numbers... She dismissed it... she saw them again"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh particulars ("frozen river," "digital tomb," "silent ghost"). Filter-verb stacks ("felt the sensed absence," "seemed satisfied") dull immediacy in key moments, triggering the Q7 artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—corporate simulation of a failed mission preserved in social archive—offers a moderately fresh angle on memory-keeper and cover-up tropes. The synthesis of digital archaeology, missing-persons mystery, and the philosophical question about deletion is specific enough to avoid pure template. However, the execution follows familiar beats: pattern discovery, buried truth, corrupt supervisor threat, protect-by-hiding choice. The ending image ("deleted files go into the keepers who choose to remember") is thematically apt but not startlingly original; the transformation of tropes remains competent rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris appears throughout and her choices (trace the pattern, excavate the data-morgue, lie to Kael, hide the truth in personal cache) create key turns. Her role as memory keeper is causally essential: her access and motivation drive the investigation. Introduced immediately, present in all major beats, and her final decision to internalize the truth rather than expose it shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The patch is mentioned twice: in the commander's diary poem (as clue to the hidden story) and implied in the final personal cache. It serves as evidence differentiating the true mission from the simulation, but is not handled on the page or used to constrain a tactical choice. Its meaning does not visibly shift between appearances; it remains a static artifact rather than a charged object that evolves under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cold case (Voyager crew's disappearance and fate) is the investigation's target, signaled early and shaping all middle beats. Aris's discovery that the mission was a corporate cover-up and the crew's true fate is the story's causal spine. The concept defines the dominant stake and alters her options at closure: expose versus protect. It is causally indispensable and drives the final choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is applied as a descriptive label in the opening ("brightly attentive gaze") and reprised in the closing image ("brightly attentive silence"). However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait colors Aris's professional manner but does not create friction or tactical consequence; it functions as atmospheric characterization rather than a choice-shaping attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris's lie to Kael ("It was just a historical curiosity... Nothing of value was found") is the climactic action that resolves the threat and defines closure. The decision is dramatized in scene with interiority ("her mind screaming") and immediate consequence (Kael's acceptance, Aris's return to her terminal with new burden). Removing this action would eliminate the story's moral calculus and the Earned Stasis closure. The lie is causally necessary, redefining her relationship to the truth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (11-23-37) appear across multiple beats: first as glitch in the nostalgia reel, then in metadata (timestamps, user IDs, color codes), and finally as coordinates leading to the data-morgue. The pattern drives Aris's investigation and shapes her method of discovery. The numbers are signaled early, constrain her path (she must decode them to find the truth), and their mechanics matter: they are the breadcrumb trail from simulation to reality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The social network archive provides the investigative arena and the thematic resonance (preserved thoughts, forgotten songs, frozen river of memory). It supplies the raw material (crew feeds, metadata, encrypted diary) that Aris examines. The setting is introduced immediately and revisited in the data-morgue excavation and final image of cheerful feeds continuing to play. However, the archive does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as terrain rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as atmospheric refrain in two beats (opening reel, final image of Voyager feeds playing). It contributes to tone and thematic texture but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The phrase evokes temporal depth (a century past) but does not impose a deadline or clock that shapes Aris's tactics. It is poetic coloring rather than a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris's desire "to find where deleted files go" is introduced immediately as her "silent ghost in the machine" and "philosophical itch" driving the obsession. The question is dramatized through her investigation and answered in the closing image: "they went into the keepers who chose to remember." The motivation conflicts with her survival (hiding vs. exposing creates cost) and is causally essential to both the investigation and the thematic closure. It is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" is introduced early ("the sensed absence, a void that hummed louder than any stored memory") and modulates through discovery (the crew's vanishing), threat (Kael's menace), and closure (the absence now "a physical weight," "a silent, enduring record"). The tone charges the final image, converting absence into presence through Aris's witness. It is coherent through turns and essential to the story's emotional architecture.</comment>
