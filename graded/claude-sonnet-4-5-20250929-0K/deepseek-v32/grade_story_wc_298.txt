<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "patch holes in her soul" is stated repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "fiercely gentle" attribute appears as a label without constraining any on-page action or revealing internal conflict. Her confession and the card's dissolution feel declared rather than earned through prior struggle, and the final "whole once more" reads as an unearned epiphany. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("dusky resolve," "reckless idealist") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story offers no clear inciting incident, escalation, or on-page decisive change—Elara descends, confesses, and leaves "whole," but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The burned card crumbles and a pristine Star appears, yet this shift is purely symbolic and occurs without tactical pressure or stakes alteration. Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where she is, and why she's there remain abstract until well past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern break, nor situational crystallization is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard imagery—tree roots snaking between bones, half-lit corridors—is vivid and consistently rendered, establishing a coherent atmosphere. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: Elara moves through it without spatial challenges, resource scarcity, or environmental pressure that alters her choices. The chamber with the solitary tree and the glint of the Star card feels staged for symbolic delivery rather than discovered through goal-directed action. Sensory detail is somewhat selective but tilts toward visual catalog over embodied, POV-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to patch holes in her soul"—is announced but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma or reversal. No meaningful tightening occurs: Elara seeks, finds a card, confesses, and the burned card conveniently crumbles without resistance or trade-off. The pristine Star card's appearance is coincidental, not earned by protagonist agency, and the resolution ("whole once more") delivers no visible cost or foreclosed path. Pressure remains static throughout, with no escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—reclaiming bartered destinies and mending fractured selfhood—is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars: "to patch holes in the soul," "inlaying meaning everywhere," and the final "whole once more" are abstract declarations. The burned Wheel crumbling into ash and the pristine Star appearing feel like symbolic conveniences rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior events. The confession scene could dramatize moral calculus or emotional friction, but instead it summarizes regrets without on-page struggle. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "To patch holes in the soul, she learned, was to accept both light and shadow."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping, and the voice carries a consistent elevated, slightly archaic register ("dusky resolve," "trammeled her spirit"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing reads interchangeably with many fantasy protagonists, and diction ("fiercely gentle," "reckless idealist") leans on stock phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. The prose maintains clarity and distance control, but syntactic patterns repeat (many sentences begin with "She" or "The") without purposeful variation. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "patch holes in her soul" appears verbatim or near-verbatim six times; "dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning everywhere," "bartered destinies," "tree roots snake between bones," and "within the glow of half-lit corridors" recur mechanically without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs appear frequently ("She + [verb]" structures across consecutive sentences). Mixed metaphor: roots "cradled" a skeleton, then a card "glint[s]" among them—the spatial logic is unclear. Stock metaphors ("holes in her soul," "fractures within") appear without fresh inflection. These artifacts dull momentum and flatten the closure beat, triggering cumulative Q7 penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—descent into a symbolic underworld to reclaim a lost self via tarot symbolism—closely matches widely used fantasy-quest and soul-journey templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The burned Wheel of Fortune crumbling and the pristine Star appearing are familiar tarot-redemption beats. Elara's journey from "reckless idealist" to "whole once more" follows a predictable arc with no fresh inflection or risk-taking that heightens stakes. The catacomb orchard imagery is vivid but does not generate surprising tactical or thematic consequences.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character "reckless idealist" is labeled early but Elara's choices on the page do not demonstrate recklessness—she moves carefully, brushes past arches gently, and sits to reflect. The idealism is told ("driven by the need," "once led her to believe she could control fate") but does not create on-page turns or tactical alterations. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears early (setup), is felt warm in her pocket (middle touch), and crumbles to ash at the ending (closure participation). However, its function is purely symbolic—it does not constrain tactics or enable a choice under pressure. The card's transformation is declared rather than causally earned by Elara's actions. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" is mentioned repeatedly as backstory context but never dramatized as a present stake or on-page choice. The original bargain and its mechanics remain abstract; no scene shows Elara renegotiating or confronting the terms with cost. The concept echoes thematically but does not shape tactics or options in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears as a label four times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Elara's touch is described as "fiercely gentle" when brushing past a bony arch and when calming her heart, but no trade-off or tactical consequence follows. The attribute is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears twice: once describing how the fortune-teller's act "trammeled her spirit," and once when Elara "trammeled through the undergrowth." Neither instance drives a major turn or redefines options—the first is backstory summary, the second a navigation verb. The action is swappable with "constrained" or "moved" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is mentioned five times as a description of Elara's interpretive stance but its mechanics are never shown or tested. The method does not shape her attempts or tactics—she simply sees convergences and speaks truths without the "inlaying" process altering outcomes. Present across beats but functionally decorative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones is established early, described across multiple beats, and returns in her memory at closure. The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance, but does not constrain choices—Elara navigates it without spatial challenges, resource limits, or environmental pressure that alters tactics. The chamber with the solitary tree is staged for discovery rather than fought for. All three gates present, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" recurs as a spatial descriptor but does not function as a timeframe. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure tightens decisions. The phrase establishes ambient lighting across beats but does not alter moves or constrain duration. Present but not operative as time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To patch holes in her soul" is stated early and repeated throughout, anchoring Elara's motivation at setup and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction between wants and costs appears. Her confession and the card's dissolution are declared outcomes, not earned struggles. Present in all three gates but summary-dominant.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" appears early and recurs across beats, establishing a consistent tonal register of shadowed determination. The tone modulates slightly from initial resolve to "clear determination" at closure, and the prose maintains coherent atmosphere. However, the shift is stated ("dusky resolve had transformed") rather than enacted through rhythm or image that charges the final moment. Setup, middle, and payoff present; modest tonal evolution.</comment>
