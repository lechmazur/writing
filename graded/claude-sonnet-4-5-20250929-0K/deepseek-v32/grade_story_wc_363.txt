<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Althea's motivation (carrying a message to Carver) is clear and singular, but her interiority reads largely in label-only abstractions: "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice," "wistful." The sacrifice itself—feeding her life-line into the Loom—arrives late and is summarized rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Carver's brief appearance at the end lacks agency; he's a passive recipient rather than a second pressure point. The piece tells us Althea is sacrificing but does not dramatize internal conflict or show her weighing competing goods in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through lyric accretion (orchard, Loom, amber bead, jigsaw pieces) toward a closure image where Althea's sacrifice completes and the orchard is saved. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Althea is gone, but the Loom continues and the orchard is whole—a renunciation with visible cost. Orientation is delayed; "who" (Althea as keeper) arrives ~80 words in, "where" (orchard in bamboo forest) ~20 words, but "when" (perpetual twilight, time's unraveling) remains vague throughout, warranting a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The causal chain (finds jigsaw pieces → melts into chronological shards → uses amber as shuttle → weaves her own life-line → message sent) holds, but the mechanics of "raveling silence" and the outer world's "frayed tapestry" are never concretely anchored, leaving the stakes abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard, bamboo forest, great Loom, and ancient pine are vivid and specific. The amber bead with fossilized firefly is a strong micro-setting object that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography is vague—where Althea stands relative to the Loom, the pine's location, how the jigsaw pieces "melt into shards on the moss"—and the perpetual twilight becomes a static backdrop rather than evolving with the story's pressure. The body as setting is absent; Althea's translucence at the end is told, not shown through embodied sensation. The setting constrains choice minimally; the Loom resists, but we never see Althea navigate physical or spatial obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (send a message to Carver) is signaled early and unified. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a single meaningful tightening: the Loom resists, the silence creeps back, so Althea draws her own life-line into the weave. This is one on-page reversal that narrows options and forecloses survival—sufficient for this length and lens. Cost is visible in the final image: "Althea was gone, her sacrifice complete." However, the middle beats (seeking threads, finding jigsaw pieces, collecting amber) are presented as summary rather than pressure; the story compresses gathering steps into a single paragraph without showing obstacles or trade-offs along the way.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (love, sacrifice, and the cost of preserving memory across impossible distance) emerges through the amber bead, the woven message, and Althea's choice to feed her essence into the Loom. The final image—orchard saved, silence now a "contented hush"—resonates without stated moral. However, the piece leans on prompt labels: "latent sacrifice," "impossible distance," "raveling silence" are repeated as thematic shorthand rather than arising organically from concrete action. The jigsaw puzzle as "fragments of lost time" and the amber as "anchor against unraveling" are rich particulars, but the story tells us their symbolic weight rather than letting them accumulate pressure through recurring, reweighted use.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Althea throughout; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, fairy-tale register ("wistful loom spinner," "fraying tapestry," "breathless effort") that is consistent and purposeful. Psychic distance is stable, though the narration occasionally drifts toward distant summary ("Each day, Althea worked"). Diction is elevated but mostly fits the mythic tone; "stoically sparkling" appears twice as a label rather than an embodied observation, reducing specificity. The final shift to Carver's POV is clean and brief, ending on Althea's closure image. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The voice reads singular and intentional, but relies on repeated abstract phrases that flatten texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is mostly controlled, but the piece suffers from patterned artifacts that dull momentum. "Stoically sparkling" appears twice as an unearned descriptor; "raveling silence" and "unraveling" recur in synonym loops without added pressure ("raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry," "unraveling force," "unraveling channels"). Template cadence runs appear: "Her motivation was singular… Her love, Carver… Her search… This, she knew…" stacks identical stems across four consecutive paragraphs. The final third carries these artifacts into closure beats ("The raveling silence roared… the unraveling channels of time"), warranting a −1.2 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Several sentences summarize rather than show: "Each day, Althea worked" compresses what could be a beat of pressure. Information density is uneven; the jigsaw-puzzle beat and amber-collection beat are vivid, but the Loom's mechanics remain vague.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—weaving reality on a Loom to send a message across time—offers a fresh angle on the separation-and-sacrifice archetype. The amber bead with fossilized firefly is a specific, memorable anchor. However, the emotional arc (protagonist sacrifices self to save beloved/world) is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; Althea's choice is presented as inevitable rather than internally contested. The jigsaw puzzle as medium is inventive but arrives and resolves in a single paragraph without complication. The outer world (human flea market, aging Carver) feels generic; the orchard and bamboo forest are vivid but not deeply particular to voice or setting. The story commits to its lyric, mythic register but does not take risks that heighten stakes or surprise within that frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Althea (wistful loom spinner) is present throughout and her choices create the key turn: she draws her life-line into the Loom and completes the weave. Setup is immediate (first paragraph). Middle development: she seeks threads, finds jigsaw pieces, collects amber—these are summarized gathering steps rather than pressure choices. Payoff: her sacrifice at closure is central. The character drives the ending, earning ~5.0–6.0 eligibility. However, "wistful loom spinner" is a label applied early but not embodied in distinct speech, gesture, or micro-choice; "wistful" and "stoically sparkling" are told traits rather than shown texture. She could be replaced by a generic "devoted keeper" with minor edits to flavor text. Causal pressure is present but the character's specificity is low, capping near 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tree sap amber bead appears in beat 1 (collected from the pine), beat 2 (used as shuttle in the Loom), and beat 3 (blazes, materializes in Carver's palm at closure). Setup early, middle development (enables the weaving), and payoff (charges the final image and carries the message). Three beats, causal pressure (without it the message cannot anchor), closure linkage (it drops into Carver's hand, delivering the memory). Specificity is high: the fossilized firefly, the glow, the warmth. Cost connection is visible: Althea's life-line is woven through it. Minor friction: the bead's mechanics (how it "blazes," how it "materialized") are summarized rather than shown step-by-step. Strong integration overall, but the swappability test is borderline—a similar talisman could serve with edits. Placing at 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "raveling silence" (core concept) is introduced early as "the raveling silence that steadily unpicked the world's edges" and recurs throughout: it creeps back when the Loom resists, it "roared in protest," and at closure it becomes "no longer a raveling, but a quiet, contented hush." Setup present. Middle: the silence is an obstacle Althea must overcome by feeding her life-line. Payoff: the final transformation (raveling → contented hush) reweights the concept. However, the concept is presented largely as atmospheric threat rather than a force that alters Althea's tactics on the page; she never negotiates with it, and its mechanics remain abstract. It functions as theme and setting mood more than a causal driver of choices. The reweighting at closure is thematic rather than tactical, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band. Capping near 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears twice as a descriptor (Althea's tears, the amber bead) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It is a label for tone and appearance, not a trait that shapes choice. Setup: mentioned in paragraph six and again at the climax. Middle development: absent. Payoff: the amber "stoically sparkling" at closure is decorative rather than causal. The attribute could be removed or replaced with "glowing" or "shimmering" without altering plot or stakes. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait. Ornamental use, capping at 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears in the penultimate paragraph: "The great mechanism, with a sound like a sigh of peace, began to recommence." Setup: the Loom's halting is implied when Althea works it. Middle: the Loom resists and must be fed Althea's life-line to continue. Payoff: the Loom's recommencement signals the orchard's salvation and the success of Althea's sacrifice. The action is central to closure—without it, the ending would read as failure. However, the action itself is passive (the Loom begins to recommence on its own after Althea's breath) rather than an active choice by the protagonist. The mechanics are vague: who or what causes the silver threads to weave themselves? The action redefines the orchard's state and confirms the sacrifice's success, earning mid-to-high integration, but the protagonist's agency in the recommencement is unclear. Placing at 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" is the method Althea discovers to repair the tapestry. Setup: she finds the pieces in the human world (paragraph eight). Middle: the pieces melt into chronological shards, which she weaves into the Loom. Payoff: the method enables the weaving that allows the message to reach Carver, who later encounters the same jigsaw box. The method is signaled early in the story's second half, its mechanics (cardboard → chronological shards) are specific, and it shapes the central attempt. However, the method is summarized in two sentences rather than dramatized; we never see Althea choose jigsaw pieces over other options, and the mechanics are told rather than shown. The method is essential to the plot but could be replaced by a similar "fragments of time" device with minor edits. Placing at 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" is present from the opening sentence. Setup immediate. Middle: the orchard houses the Loom, the ancient pine (source of amber), and the gnarled apple trees (planted by Carver). The orchard is the spatial anchor for all of Althea's work. Payoff: "The forgotten orchard was saved, its tapestry whole." The setting is essential to framing the story and supplies the pine/amber resource. However, the orchard does not pressure choices; Althea never navigates its layout under constraint, and the bamboo forest is mentioned only as a boundary Carver crossed. The setting is vivid but functions more as backdrop than as a force that alters tactics. Micro-setting elements (the Loom, the pine) do more causal work than the orchard itself. Placing at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" (timeframe) appears in the opening sentence and recurs as "perpetual twilight," "raveling silence," and the outer world's "frayed tapestry." Setup immediate. Middle: Althea works "each day," but the passage of time is vague—no clock or deadline tightens her choices. Payoff: the timeframe is central to theme (time unraveling, message sent across centuries) but does not constrain Althea's tactics on the page. She never races a deadline or loses stamina as time passes. The timeframe is atmospheric and thematic rather than a live pressure. It is present throughout but does not shape decisions with cost, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band. Capping at 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To carry a message across impossible distance" is stated explicitly as Althea's motivation in paragraph four and drives every action: seeking threads, collecting amber, weaving her life-line. Setup early. Middle: the motivation shapes all gathering and weaving beats. Payoff: the message reaches Carver at closure, fulfilling the goal. The motivation is coherent and central. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we do not see Althea weigh the message's importance against survival or other goods. The "impossible distance" is told as a fact rather than tested on the page. The motivation is essential but lacks friction between competing wants, capping it below the high band. Placing at 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" appears as a label in paragraph seven and is acted upon in the climax when Althea draws her life-line into the Loom. The tone (sacrifice, loss, love across distance) is coherent and modulates through the gathering, resistance, and final choice beats. Setup mid-story as a label. Middle: the tone tightens as the silence creeps back. Payoff: the sacrifice is completed and the tone shifts to "quiet, contented hush." The tone charges the final image. However, "latent sacrifice" is an abstract label rather than an embodied texture; the piece tells us the sacrifice is latent rather than showing Althea suppress or negotiate it. The tone is present and purposeful but relies on declaration more than dramatic embodiment. Placing at 5.3.</comment>
