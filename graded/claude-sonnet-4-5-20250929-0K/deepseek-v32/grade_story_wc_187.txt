<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is sustained and consistent—preemptive nostalgia, stewardship drive—but remains largely reflective rather than contradictory under pressure. The vision at the granolith offers a micro-turn, yet the decision to transcribe feels more like dutiful enactment than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible personal cost. Embodiment is present (kneeling, palm on crystal) but emotions are labeled more than dramatized through bodily contradiction. The final identity-resculpting is asserted rather than shown through a choice that alters her stance or forfeits something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (stormlit observatory, Elara, forecourt). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's act of transcription reintroduces silenced memory, and the granolith's shadow reappears, signaling recovery with conceptual cost (she must reintroduce pain). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—whispers build density, shadow metrics calibrate, vision crystallizes—and the final image reweights the archival task. Cost is conceptual and felt (the danger of willful forgetting) but not materially tested against a personal trade-off on the page, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (jeweled droplets, conductive veins, stormlit pulses). The forecourt functions as micro-setting: whispers anchor memory-work, and the vanished shadow signals rupture, constraining Elara's response. The environment charges the final image (shadow reappearing across the forecourt) and the setting details—quartz staircase, obsidian spire, granolith—guide her calibration beats. Spatial choreography is clean and the world logic (crystal lattice storing memory) remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stewarding collective memory against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the granolith's shadow vanishes, revealing deliberate forgetting. The vision provides escalation: Elara sees the community's erasure and acts to restore the silenced record. However, the act of transcription faces no on-page resistance or cost that narrows her options; she simply writes and the shadow returns. One meaningful deepening occurs (conjecture crystallizes into understanding), but the price is conceptual rather than a live trade-off or forfeiture that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—identity sculpted from inherited memory, the danger of willful forgetting—emerges organically through Elara's calibration work and the vision of erasure. The final image (shadow reappearing, weight of recovered stories) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: honest self requires complete collective memory. Preemptive nostalgia and the fluid-sculpture metaphor enrich subtext. The vision's urgent voice and the granolith inscription provide non-literal thematic anchors. However, "identity subtly resculpted by the act of reclaiming" in the final line leans slightly toward summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's filter emphasizes memory, resonance, and temporal calibration. Vocabulary is controlled (summer-quill, granolith, conductive ink) and syntax modulates with the deepening hush. No dialogue. "Preemptively nostalgic" and "quiet conjecture" anchor voice specificity. Minor register drift: "collective memory stream rupture" and "preservation was not enough" feel slightly editorial in peak beats, but remain within the archival idiom. Psychic distance is consistent and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious with high figurative density: "fog had become solid," "jeweled with droplets," "deepening hush of resonance," "fluid sculpture." Sentence openings vary and spatial choreography is clear. However, several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "These were not echoes of the present, but fragments of collective memory" immediately restates the established forecourt function; "The core concept of her work was the stewardship of collective memory" recaps the stated motivation. Template cadence in the monument-examination sequence: "She moved to... By measuring... This data helped..." Figurative density in the vision and closure beats remains elevated but comprehensible, avoiding muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—archivist measuring monument shadows to anchor collective memory whispers above a fog-floor—is genuinely fresh and synthesizes archival stewardship with fantasy physics. The vanishing shadow as rupture signal is non-obvious. However, the vision delivery (palm-on-crystal → urgent voice shows erasure) and the transcription-restores-shadow resolution follow familiar fantasy-restoration logic without additional friction. Elara's internal arc (conjecture → understanding → act) is linear and the emotional specificity (preemptive nostalgia) is stated more than it constrains on-page choices. The world-building particulars (summer-quill, granolith) add texture but the core turn does not transform prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat: descends, walks, measures, conjectures, kneels, transcribes. Setup: early. Development: calibration and vision constrain her response. Closure: transcription drives shadow recovery. However, most beats are observation and reflection; the sole agency-driven turn is the transcription choice, which faces no on-page resistance. Cost is conceptual (must reintroduce painful history) but not a personal forfeiture that alters her options. Two distinct beats (measuring, transcribing) with closure linkage lift the score, but lack of conflicted choice caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt appears in setup (descends onto it), is used in multiple beats (walking triggers whispers, kneeling on it delivers vision), and charges closure (shadow reappears "across the forecourt"). The rain-slicked surface enables the whispering mechanism and the clear fog-window signals rupture. Three gates met, with causal pressure (whispers anchor memory-work) and closure linkage. Specificity: the crystal lattice storing memory is irreplaceable. However, the forecourt itself is passive infrastructure; Elara acts upon it rather than wrestling with its constraints, keeping it shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collective memory is the story's engine: whispers are fragments of it, shadow metrics anchor it, the vision reveals its erasure, transcription restores it. Setup: early ("collective memory, stored within the crystal lattice"). Development: calibration and rupture discovery constrain tactics. Closure: "collective memory, in its entirety, was the only true material" articulates the stake and the shadow's return demonstrates restoration. Three gates met with causal pressure and closure participation. Cost is conceptual (deliberate forgetting vs. honest identity) and legible. This exact concept drives the arc and cannot be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Preemptive nostalgia appears in setup ("already mourning moments that had not yet passed") and returns mid-story ("dreading the day she would only remember the work of remembering") and subtly in closure ("her own identity subtly resculpted"). However, it remains an emotional coloring rather than a constraint that alters a choice with visible cost. The trait enriches voice and theme but does not force a trade-off or enable a tactic on the page. Two lyric reprises with thematic linkage but no causal pressure caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conjecture appears in setup ("Her action was one of quiet conjecture"), development ("Elara conjectured that identity itself was not a static carving"), and climax ("Her conjecture crystallized into understanding"). Three gates met. The crystallization moment drives the transcription choice. However, "conjecture" could be replaced with "interpretation," "synthesis," or "analysis" with minimal structural change; the specificity of the action is less critical than the content of the realization. Causal role in one major beat (vision → understanding → act) with closure linkage but swappability keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Shadow examination is signaled early ("examining shadow lengths at monuments"), executed in development ("measuring the precise angle and length of its shadow," "recorded the shadow metrics"), and pays off at closure (vanished shadow signals rupture, restored shadow confirms recovery). Three gates met with causal pressure: the method anchors temporal registers, and shadow absence/presence drives escalation and resolution. Two distinct beats (obsidian spire measurement, granolith discovery) with closure linkage. Specificity: shadow-as-memory-integrity marker is purpose-built for this world. Strong integration but the method itself is not wrestled with under stress.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory is anchored early (title image, "above the clouds, the summer-quill archivist...worked alone") and frames all action. The storm's silent flashes power the dome, the forecourt is the work site, and the solid fog provides the clarity-window that signals rupture. Setup and development: the setting enables memory-work and discovery. Closure: "stormlit sky pulsed," "observatory" in final paragraph. Three gates met. However, the observatory is backdrop; Elara does not wrestle with spatial constraints or use its resources tactically beyond the existing infrastructure. Atmospheric pressure is strong but physical constraint is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "after fog becomes solid" is established in setup ("The fog had become solid"). The solid fog is present throughout (floor beneath, window to world below) and the clear fog at the granolith signals the memory rupture. Two gates (setup, development via rupture signal) but no explicit closure participation beyond ambient presence. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; "after" is a state, not a ticking clock. Logical consistency but no causal pressure or tactical constraint. Functional but replaceable with "during the storm" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to sculpt identity from experience") and reprised at closure ("identity subtly resculpted by the act"). The vision dramatizes the danger (malformed identity from deliberate forgetting) and the transcription enacts the stewardship. Three gates met with thematic linkage. However, the desire is told and reflected upon rather than conflicted in a choice with visible cost. Elara's want (preserve memory) does not clash with a competing need or fear on the page; she simply acts on understanding. Setup, thematic development, and closure echo but no on-page friction caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tone—deepening hush—is introduced early ("deepening hush of the environment"), sustained ("profound, deepening hush settled"), and charges closure ("filled not with emptiness, but with the weight of recovered stories"). The tone modulates coherently: soft chorus → urgent voice → profound hush. Sensory specificity (thickening resonance, air listening) and cadence control support the accumulative pressure. Three gates met with clear modulation and closure participation. The hush reweights the final image, transforming silence from absence into presence. Strong tonal integration across beats and ending.</comment>
