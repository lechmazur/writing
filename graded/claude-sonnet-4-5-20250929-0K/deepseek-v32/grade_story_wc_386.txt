<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior voice is consistent and her professional expertise anchors her choices, but her motivation remains told rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The decision to "weave the truth" into the collective unconscious at closure feels unearned—no on-page struggle or cost dramatizes why she must act now or what she risks. Linnea's presence in the ice is evocative but serves as exposition vehicle rather than applying genuine pressure to Elara's stance. The final act of projection lacks visible personal cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (shrine, ice, Elara's purpose). The causal lens wobbles: Elara's weeks of dream analysis are summarized rather than shown, and the climactic "weaving" of truth into the collective stream is asserted without mechanics or on-page resistance. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing (the captain's name cleared, Linnea at peace), but the cost is implied off-page rather than felt in the moment—no visible trade-off or renunciation alters Elara's options. The piece ends with atmospheric resolution but lacks the sharp before/after that undeniable cost would provide.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with consistent sensory anchoring: candle-refracted light, sharp blue silence, ice as fossil medium. Spatial choreography is clean (altar, ice walls, Elara's placement), and the environment charges the closure image when the ice windows become lenses for truth projection. The melted snow globe on the altar gains physical presence and emotional weight, functioning as both relic and thematic anchor. The "borrowed starlight of a hundred candles" is evocative and recurs to close the piece, reweighting the opening image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing the captain's name and granting Linnea peace—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is shallow: Elara asks "How?" and Linnea immediately provides the answer ("the windows"), removing genuine constraint. No visible obstacle tests Elara's method or forces a trade-off; she simply "focuses her will" and succeeds. The piece reads situational-to-accumulative rather than causal, yet even under that lens the final act lacks felt cost or a tightening that narrows options. Closure is conceptually clean but lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging pure truth from wreckage emerges through specific images (melted globe, ice as memory, the ship's turn) and avoids overt moralizing. Linnea's revelation that the captain turned toward the iceberg to save others is a strong thematic reversal, reweighting blame into sacrifice. The final image—truth projected through ice windows, globe holding "perfect, silent frost"—offers resonant closure without summary. However, the piece leans slightly toward affirming the premise rather than deepening it with ambiguity or counter-pressure; the truth is purely redemptive, the ending purely peaceful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's professional idiom ("nexus," "triangulate," "anchor point") and tactile attentiveness to ice, silence, echo. Linnea's voice in the ice is appropriately otherworldly ("the voice the sound of distant crevasse"). Diction remains character-bound with no register drift. A minor slip: "weaves truth carefully" in paragraph two shifts to past tense mid-sentence ("she weaves") when the frame is present-tense narration, briefly disrupting tense consistency. Otherwise, voice modulates well under pressure and the final image sustains tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with vivid specificity ("fractal patterns shimmered," "luminous, blue silence") and purposeful rhythm. However, several loops and near-duplicates reduce density: "not in the air, but in the ice itself" echoes the structure of earlier not/but constructions; "windows of connection" appears three times with identical phrasing. The phrase "borrowed starlight" recurs purposefully but "a hundred flickering flames" / "a thousand candles" inconsistency introduces minor continuity noise. Opening and closing images are strong, and no major artifacts obscure the closure beat. Information density is solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer premise is fresh and the glacier shrine setting offers a non-obvious spatial anchor. The method of triangulating spirits via collective dream cameos is inventive. However, the emotional arc and resolution follow a predictable trajectory: spirit reveals buried truth, protagonist projects truth to world, peace achieved. The captain's selfless turn is a strong reversal but the frictionless execution at closure reduces ingenuity. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but the final act lacks the surprise or complication that would elevate it into higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the story and makes the final decision to project truth, but her choices lack on-page friction or cost. She asks questions and receives answers; the climactic act is described as effort ("focusing her will") but encounters no resistance. Present across setup, middle exposition, and closure, but her agency at the ending is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in three beats: discovered in Linnea's coat (setup), placed on the altar and identified as "garden" (middle), and holding "perfect, silent frost" at closure. It carries thematic weight (memory of home, ruin transformed) and charges the final image. However, Elara does not handle or use it to solve a problem; it remains symbolic rather than tactically active. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Windows of connection shape the premise (shrine as nexus, ice walls as lenses) and provide the mechanism for the climactic act when Elara projects truth "through the windows." The concept constrains the setting choice and enables the resolution. Signaled early ("perfect windows of connection") and returned with causal force at closure. Removing this exact concept would require a different resolution mechanism, making it essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is described in paragraph two ("threading their confessions... without pulling too hard") but this trait is never tested on the page. Elara does not face a moment where pulling too hard or too gently creates visible cost. The attribute is label-only; her method at closure ("wove the truth") echoes the phrase but does not dramatize the careful threading as a constraint or enable a specific tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expose" drives the ending when Elara projects the captain's true motive into the dreaming world, clearing his name. The action is signaled as her crystallized purpose midway ("She must expose this truth") and executed at closure. However, the act is summary rather than scene: we see her focus will and the result, but not the mechanics or resistance. Present in setup (implicit goal), middle turn (explicit purpose), and closure, but could be replaced with "reveal" or "share" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dream analysis is the method that leads Elara to the shrine (weeks of coastal-town dreams pointing north). It is expository setup and explains her arrival but does not shape on-page tactics or create a constraint during the climactic scene. Signaled early and causally functional for arrival, but absent from middle and closure beats. Functional but not irreplaceable; other methods (visions, maps, spirit summons) could achieve the same setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is established early with vivid sensory detail and returns with causal force when its ice walls function as lenses to project truth. The setting constrains the story's logic (why this remote location) and provides the enabling resource for closure (windows as projection medium). Present in setup, charged throughout via ice-as-medium imagery, and integral to the resolution mechanism. Removing the shrine would break the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "salvage something pure" is stated early and reappears at the midpoint when Elara identifies the captain's courage as "the pure thing." It frames her purpose and is resolved at closure when "the pure thing salvaged at last." However, the desire is more thematic declaration than dramatized friction; Elara never struggles between salvaging and abandoning, or chooses this mission over another. Present across setup, middle crystallization, and closure, with consistent pressure, but lacks on-page conflict between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight establishes tone in the opening ("borrowed starlight of a hundred flickering flames") and returns in the final paragraph ("under the borrowed starlight of a thousand candles"), reweighting the image with closure peace. The tone—elegiac, luminous, reverent—coheres throughout and modulates appropriately when Linnea's presence intensifies ("the ice grew colder"). The reprise charges the ending and the specific phrase is irreplaceable for its semantic echo (borrowed light = mediated truth). Minor numeric inconsistency (hundred/thousand) slightly weakens precision.</comment>
