<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to serve the ghost is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "driftingly alert" trait appears as label-only without constraining action. Internal conflict is absent; Lyra moves smoothly through each glyph without competing impulses or visible cost to her own stakes. The final contentment feels unearned because no personal path was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through three glyph-stampings with mounting storm intensity. Orientation anchors arrive late (~line 7 clarifies the floating island context). Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost "integrated and whole"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Lyra's state at the end is unchanged, and no visible price lands on the page. The "new, quiet song" in the penultimate beat gestures toward change without dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, storm timing, and mossy tiles create vivid spatial grounding. The flower press bolt plate is handled tactilely across multiple beats, constraining Lyra's stamping actions. However, the "floating island's machinery" and "arcaded walls" remain generic; specific sensory detail (temperature, sound texture, tile resistance) would deepen immersion. Micro-setting (tile, plate, pigment bed) does charge the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulating the ghost's needs—is signaled early and tightens through three glyph attempts as the storm accelerates. The timeframe between lightning and thunder narrows options, creating escalation. Yet the protagonist faces no trade-off or decision that forecloses a path; each glyph succeeds without complication. The ghost's transformation happens to Lyra rather than through a choice she makes. Cost is asserted in theme but not enacted in tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of communion and "tinkersong wonder" emerges from the encoding ritual and the ghost's manifestation. The final image of Lyra descending with a new song offers conceptual resonance. However, the story borders on thematic statement ("messages sent and received") rather than letting image do the work. The ghost's loneliness is told rather than inferred, and the "story fully told" line moralizes the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Lyra notices hum, mist, glyph-glow). Diction is elevated and controlled, fitting a bardic register. Filter verbs ("knowing," "felt") cluster in the opening third but do not obscure clarity. The phrase "tinkersong wonder" as narratorial label rather than Lyra's thought creates mild distance inconsistency. No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent but somewhat formal under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully; rhythm accelerates during the storm sequence. Several paraphrase loops appear: "unspoken needs" recurs without reweighting (lines 3, 13, 19, 30). Template cadence in the storm beats ("Another lightning flash; Lyra worked faster" / "The ensuing lightning strike") flattens propulsion. Stock phrasing: "formless voice a cascade of chimes," "world-ending crash." High figurative density in non-peak beats (line 2 "driftingly alert, a state between dreaming") without payoff. Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The graffiti-encoding-as-communion premise offers a fresh synthesis of street art and ghost story. The timeframe constraint (lightning-to-thunder) is specific and shapes tactics. However, the "ghost in code" and "floating island" lean on familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. Emotional arc is generic: loneliness → articulation → peace. The balladeer's voice and lute are set up but never used, a missed opportunity for earned contrast.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present in every beat and performs the encoding action. She is labeled "seldom-heard balladeer" but this trait does not constrain choices or create friction—her voice/song is abandoned. She acts but does not decide under competing pressures; the ghost's needs drive her without internal conflict. Setup present, development functional, closure participates (she picks up the plate, forms a new song), but swappable with "artist" or "medium" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate is introduced early (line 6), used in three distinct stamping beats (lines 9–10, 16, 22), and picked up at closure (line 31) where it is noted as "now warm," reweighting its state. Its grooved surface enables the encoding method; removing it would break the ritual. Specificity ("cool, heavy," "iron," "grooves") is high. However, the plate does not constrain a choice—Lyra never struggles with its weight or limits—so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" is named (line 4), manifests (line 25), and is "integrated and whole" at closure (line 30). It shapes the dominant stake (articulation) and the glyphs respond to it. However, the ghost remains passive; it does not resist, evolve tactics, or complicate Lyra's work. The "code" aspect (machinery hum, lattice) is descriptive rather than mechanical—no debugging or interface problem. Setup solid, development limited (ghost is felt but does not act), closure linkage present but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is mentioned once (line 2) as label without demonstration. Lyra's senses are "tuned to the approaching storm," but this state does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. She works "faster" (line 16) and kneels (line 22) under pressure, but those are generic responses, not products of this specific attribute. Ornamental trait; swappable with "focused" or "attuned."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Encode" is the action Lyra performs in three beats (lines 10, 16, 22); the glyphs she stamps are the story's mechanism for communion. The encoding shapes the ghost's response (line 12 hum, line 18 phantom blooms, line 25 manifestation). Removing encoding would collapse the plot. However, the act itself is repetitive without escalation—each glyph succeeds without complication, so causal pressure is linear rather than sharpening.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Messages encoded in graffiti art, etched onto specific, mossy tiles" is introduced (line 5) and executed across three stamping beats. The method's mechanics (pigment bed, grooves, glyphs illuminate in sequence) matter to the ritual and distinguish it from generic "spell." Setup early, development solid (glyphs link in a chain, line 17), closure participation (glyphs fade to "pigment and petal dust," line 28). Specificity is high but the method could be replaced with another symbolic act (carving, painting) without fundamental loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "misty courtyard above clouds" anchors every beat; the floating island, storm, mossy tiles, and central tile bed are concrete. The setting's height and storm exposure create the lightning-thunder timeframe that tightens action. However, the courtyard does not constrain choice—Lyra moves freely, tiles are always accessible. It charges the final image (line 28 "still") and provides atmosphere, but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is signaled (line 8), used in three beats (lines 8, 16, 21), and tightens visibly ("interval...shortened to a single, held breath," line 21). It shapes Lyra's pacing ("worked faster," line 16) and creates urgency. The final strike (line 23) and silence (line 24) mark the closure moment. Removing this clock would flatten escalation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To articulate unspoken needs" is stated (line 3) and governs Lyra's goal across all beats. The ghost's needs are described (line 15) and answered (line 30). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through friction—Lyra never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices her own need. The motivation drives action but does not create internal conflict or visible cost. Setup early, development functional, closure participation present but not charged with personal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder, the joy of delicate, technical magic" is named (line 14) and echoed in the final paragraph (line 33). Tone is lyric and elevated throughout, modulating minimally—wonder persists even under storm pressure. The final image (clear sky, satisfied silence, line 35) sustains the tone. However, the tone is asserted by the narrator rather than embodied in Lyra's perception; her interiority does not shift texture under stress. Functional but not indispensable to closure.</comment>
