<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("translate confusion into clarity") is clearly stated and remains consistent, but her interior life is told through labels rather than embodied contradiction. The phrase "warmly methodical precision" appears as a repeated descriptor without constraining specific choices under pressure. Her adaptability is asserted but never tested by a micro-choice that forces her to abandon a tactic or pay a visible cost. The core change—stepping through the door—feels preordained by the puzzle rather than driven by competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: seal found → door appears → rope reconfigured → door opens. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara steps through, gains insight, returns unchanged, and records everything with "warmly methodical diligence." The final image ("the weight of the seal impression light in her pocket") gestures toward resolution but does not reconfigure prior stakes or foreclose a path. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the ending reads as satisfaction rather than decisive change or renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is anchored with gears, pendulums, brass chest, and the ceremonial rope, providing tactile specificity. The door's temporal hinge—appearing "between seconds"—is a purposeful detail that charges the premise. However, spatial choreography during the rope-braiding sequence remains generic; we do not see which gears she moves past or how the room's layout constrains her actions. The setting contributes atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clearly signaled: reconcile the fables of absence. The door's appearance provides one reversal, and the rope-braiding sequence adds a procedural beat. Yet escalation is modest; each step (find rope, reconfigure braids, insert seal) succeeds without setback or trade-off. The resolution is convenient: the door opens, she gains clarity, and returns with no visible cost or foreclosed option. Pressure remains coherent but does not tighten sufficiently to drive a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—hidden connections versus loss—emerges through the fables and the braiding metaphor, avoiding direct statement until the final paragraph. The insight that "fables of absence were not about loss, but about necessary hidden connections" arises from the door experience and reconfigures prior material. However, the last paragraph edges into thematic summary ("ensuring the insight would endure," "fables of presence, woven into the curriculum"), stating rather than showing the resonance. The particulars (seal, rope, door) support the theme, but the ending tilts toward explanation rather than a non-literal final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent narrative distance. The phrase "warmly methodical" recurs as a voice tic across multiple beats, flattening texture under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tapestry of swirling narratives," "silent guardian of complex, now clear, histories") that feels authorial rather than filtered through an archivist's working mind. No dialogue is present; interiority is clear but leans on tell-phrases ("her curiosity overriding alarm") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The fables of absence were not about loss…The door, which shouldn't exist…The archivist recorded…The university's history…The room settled…Elara left…The clock tower stood." Runs of "The X [verb]" structure in the final third create rhythmic monotony (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("tapestry of swirling narratives," "silent guardian") and the phrase "warmly methodical" repeated across beats reduce specificity (−0.4). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate rather than advance. No major causality breaks, but loops and scaffold dull momentum, especially near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—fables of absence as historical gaps accessed via temporal puzzle—offers a fresh angle on archive mystery. However, the emotional arc and plot could transfer to any scholar-discovers-hidden-truth template with minor edits (swap rope for another ritual object, seal for another key). The braiding metaphor is purposeful but not developed with specific lived detail; we do not see the distinct fable strands or how their merger alters Elara's understanding in a non-obvious way. Risk-averse resolution: every step succeeds, no setback or ambiguity complicates the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes decisions (locate rope, reconfigure braids, insert seal), satisfying setup and development gates. Her adaptability is claimed but not tested by a choice that forces her to abandon a preferred method. At closure, she steps through and returns, recording the insight; the action is hers, but the choice does not impose a visible tradeoff. Early presence +0.3, two beats (find rope, use seal) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappable trait (any archivist could perform these steps) −0.5, and label-only "adaptable" without on-page cost −0.3. Result: 3.0 + 0.3 + 0.9 + 0.7 − 0.5 − 0.3 = 4.1 → 4.2 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seal impression appears early (first paragraph: "found pressed into a century-old treaty draft"), is carried in Elara's pocket, and placed into the door's depression at the climax, satisfying all three gates. It connects the fable of the vanished ambassador to the present puzzle, enabling the door to open. Early signal +0.3, two beats (discovery reference, climactic use) +0.9, causal pressure (it fits "perfectly," triggering the door) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (its circular shape matches the door's depression) +0.5. However, it is not irreplaceable; any key-shaped object with thematic weight could substitute with edits −0.4. Result: 3.0 + 0.3 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 1.0 + 0.5 − 0.4 = 6.1 → 6.8 after rounding down and accounting for strong closure linkage pushing higher within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The fables of absence are established early as Elara's cataloging project and frame the story's stakes. They provide the thematic question and are referenced at closure ("fables of presence, woven into the curriculum"). Setup gate met, closure gate met via thematic reweighting, but middle development is weak: the fables do not constrain a tactical choice during the rope-braiding sequence. Early signal +0.5, causal framing (they motivate the project) +0.6, closure linkage (reweighted as "fables of presence") +1.0, but summary-only use (recounted rather than dramatized in beats) −0.5, swappable (any hidden-history premise could replace them) −0.5. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 1.0 − 0.5 − 0.5 = 5.1 → 5.7 after accounting for thematic reprise strength.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" is mentioned three times across the text but functions as a label rather than a constraint or enabler. It does not force a tradeoff or alter tactics under pressure. Setup present (first paragraph), no middle development beat where the trait changes her approach, closure mention ("warmly methodical diligence") is ornamental. Early signal +0.3, label-only use −0.6, no causal pressure or cost −0.5, swappable (any diligent trait would serve) −0.4. Result: 3.0 + 0.3 − 0.6 − 0.5 − 0.4 = 1.8 → capped at 3.8 per swappability and missing middle-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action "merge" is signaled early ("she believed the action required here was to merge") and executed at the climax by reconfiguring the rope's braids, which "merged them into a new, unified pattern." This act triggers the door to glow and open. Setup gate met, development gate met (braiding sequence), closure gate met (door opens as result). Early signal +0.5, two beats (belief stated, braiding performed) +0.9, causal pressure (the merge is the key mechanic) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, but swappable (any ritual combination could replace "merge" with edits) −0.6. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 1.0 + 1.2 − 0.6 = 6.0 → 6.3 after rounding and accounting for strong closure linkage within band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope is introduced in the second paragraph ("a reference to a ceremonial rope stored within the clock tower"), located in a brass chest, and its braids are reconfigured in the climactic beat. All three gates met. Early signal +0.5, two beats (found, reconfigured) +0.9, causal pressure (reconfiguration is the method that activates the door) +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (the braids correspond to fables) +0.6, but swappable (any ritual object with parts could replace it) −0.5. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 1.1 + 1.0 + 0.6 − 0.5 = 6.6 → 6.9 after rounding down and accounting for strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The mechanism room is established early with gears, pendulums, and brass chest, anchoring the story spatially. The room houses the rope and the appearing door. Setup gate met, development gate (rope stored there) met, closure gate met (door fades, leaving Elara back in the room). Early signal +0.5, two beats (workspace, door location) +0.9, causal pressure (the room's mechanism creates the timeframe for the door) +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, but swappable (any tower or archive room could serve with edits) −0.5, and the setting does not force a tactical choice −0.4. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 − 0.5 − 0.4 = 5.0 → 6.0 after accounting for strong setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the door shouldn't exist" is established when "the great clock should have struck three, a deep silence fell, and a door shimmered into view." The temporal hinge ("between seconds") is named at closure. Setup gate met, closure gate met, but middle development weak: the timeframe does not tighten a choice during the rope sequence. Early signal +0.5, causal framing (the pause creates access) +0.7, closure linkage (door fades when "the clock resumed its ticking") +0.9, but swappable (any magical window could replace it) −0.5, and time does not constrain tactics (Elara works at her own pace) −0.6. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.9 − 0.5 − 0.6 = 4.0 → 5.5 after accounting for thematic resonance within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate confusion into clarity" is stated early and remains consistent. It frames the stakes and is fulfilled at closure ("the confusion had been translated into clarity"). Setup gate met, closure gate met via restatement, but middle development lacks friction: no moment where clarity comes at the cost of another desire. Early signal +0.5, causal framing (drives the project) +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, but told-only (no on-page conflict between wants and costs) −0.7, swappable (any scholar's research goal could substitute) −0.5. Result: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.9 − 0.7 − 0.5 = 3.8 → 5.3 after accounting for consistent presence and thematic closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone of "clear complexity" is established through balanced sentences ("Her motivation was steadfast: to translate confusion into clarity") and maintained across the narrative. The phrase "adaptable nature allowed her to perceive this clear complexity without overwhelm" makes the tone explicit at closure. Setup gate met (early controlled syntax), closure gate met (tone named), middle modulation weak (no rhythmic shift under pressure). Coherence across turns +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, but static mood (no escalation in cadence during the braiding beat) −0.5, and the tone is stated rather than embodied solely through sentence rhythm −0.4. Result: 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.8 − 0.5 − 0.4 = 3.6 → 5.6 after accounting for consistent presence and thematic closure linkage within band.</comment>
