<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation ("to find the beginning in every ending") is declared but never dramatized as an internal conflict or contradictory impulse. Her actions follow a smooth, competent path without genuine struggle or blind spots that force mistakes. The closure choice—recording the frequency—feels procedurally accomplished rather than earned through character tension. Interiority remains generic ("the insight remained") without embodied contradiction or cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density build toward a conceptual reweighting), but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Lyra records the frequency and walks away satisfied, with no dramatized forfeiture or stance crystallization. The "shard of hush" and "hollywood star fragment" function as convenient plot keys rather than constraint-driven choices. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly, but the ending delivers thematic summary ("every ending was indeed a start") instead of an on-page reconfiguration with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio tower city suspended over a gorge is vividly sketched and returns at closure ("a tool, not a tomb"), charging the final stance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lyra's professional lens (dials, frequency, gravitational tides). However, spatial choreography within the tower remains vague—no concrete movement through console to dish—and the gorge below functions as backdrop rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (tune the receiver to find the celestial signal) is clear and tightens once when Lyra discards the assumption that the signal is loud. However, no genuine reversal or choice narrows options with cost: the hollywood star fragment and shard of hush resolve the problem they did not create, and the climax (hearing the tone) arrives without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. Escalation reads as procedural completion rather than agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (beginnings in endings, cycles, discarding assumptions) is woven through imagery (supernova → stellar nurseries) and the recurring motif of silence/hush. The final image attempts resonance ("abandoned city stood silent against the stars"), but the ending paragraph over-articulates the thesis ("every ending was indeed a start, a principle now proven") instead of trusting the dramatized particulars. Subtext in gesture and image is present but diluted by direct thematic statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (signal interpreter's technical lens: "frequency," "gravitational tides," "harmonic"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrases ("serenely electric atmosphere," "fantasy practicality") feel author-imposed rather than character-specific. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and psychic distance modulates appropriately. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of climb/descent details) serves momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm, but pervasive template cadence appears: "She [verb]" openers across 8+ sentences, and paraphrase loops recur ("The receiver hissed, then emitted" / "Lyra heard... she found"). Stock metaphors ("cosmic whispers," "drumhead tension") and thematic echo in the final paragraph ("every ending was indeed a start, a principle now proven") dull the closure image. Information density is moderate; many lines do double work, but scaffolding phrases ("Her motivation was clear," "The story of the signal was over") slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" concept offers a fresh inflection (silence as harvested object), and the premise (tuning to absence within sound) is non-obvious. However, execution leans on familiar quest-object structure (find two artifacts, combine them, solve the puzzle) without transforming the template through character calculus or world-specific cost. The ending's thematic articulation ("every ending was indeed a start") reads as prompt-satisfying summary rather than durable synthesis. Emotional truth and human complexity are underserved by Lyra's competence-without-struggle arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra ("celestial signal interpreter") is on-page throughout and drives the tuning action across multiple beats (climb, connect fragment, insert shard, adjust dials). Her choice to "discard assumptions" at the climax narrows her search method, and she records the frequency at closure. However, her decisions feel procedural rather than conflicted—she executes a checklist without visible cost or renunciation. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal role in two beats; moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "hollywood star fragment" is introduced early (carried in her pack), used in a middle beat (connected to receiver core as "paradoxical anchor"), and returns at closure ("now dull, had served its purpose"). It enables the tuning by filtering noise, a causal function across two distinct beats. However, its properties are declared rather than tested under pressure, and its cost (becoming dull) is stated not dramatized. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate; swappability moderate (any "focus" object could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is introduced mid-story (found in drawer), used immediately (inserted into secondary port to create "perfect quiet"), and shapes the climax tactic (tune to absence within sound). It directly alters Lyra's method and enables the final discovery, with the closing reflection ("the space where new assumptions could grow") reweighting its meaning. Present in middle and ending; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. Missing early setup caps at ~6.1 baseline, but strong causal necessity and closure reconfiguration elevate within allowable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "serenely electric" appears three times as atmospheric label ("air felt serenely electric," "serenely electric surge of understanding," "serenely electric song") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. It describes mood rather than driving action. Present in setup and ending (reprise); no middle development; ornamental use; no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tune" is Lyra's core action, repeated across beats (tune the dish, tune to quiet point, tune the receiver). The climax turn hinges on tuning "not to a sound, but to the absence within a sound," and the ending image returns to the concept ("always tuning"). It shapes two major beats and the closure stance. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate to high; closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate (the mechanics of tuning are told more than shown, reducing irreplaceability slightly).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" is declared early ("her motivation was clear"), explicitly invoked at the climax ("she must proceed by discarding assumptions," "Discarding her assumption that the celestial signal would be loud"), and reflected in the ending ("by discarding assumptions"). It directly alters her search tactic (tune to absence not presence). Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal role in one key beat; closure linkage present. However, the mechanics are told rather than tested—no dramatized cost of wrong assumptions first, reducing felt necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge" is introduced early (she climbs the gantry), provides the physical location for all action, and returns at closure with reweighted meaning ("a tool, not a tomb"). However, it functions primarily as backdrop: the gorge does not constrain tactics, the suspension is atmospheric, and the tower's specific features (dials, console) are generic infrastructure. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak; causal pressure low; closure reconfiguration present but thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"During lunar perigee" is introduced early ("lunar perigee washed the steel forest"), mentioned at the climax ("During lunar perigee, gravitational tides subtly bent radio waves"), and noted at closure ("lunar perigee had passed"). It enables the tuning tactic in one beat by bending radio waves. Setup and middle development present; payoff weak (mentioned as concluded but no cost tied to its passing). Causal pressure moderate in one beat; swappability moderate (any astronomical event could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is declared early, explicitly guides her search ("she sought the gap"), and is satisfied at closure ("she had found a beginning in an ending"). It frames the dominant stake across all beats. However, it is told rather than dramatized as internal conflict—no friction between this desire and competing wants or costs. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal role weak (label-only); no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tone "fantasy practicality" is invoked early ("tone of fantasy practicality that defined her work"), guides her approach ("guided by fantasy's logic," "practical turns"), and returns at closure ("fantasy practicality: it was a tool, not a tomb"). It modulates with pressure (technical precision during tuning, reflective distance at end). Setup, development, and payoff present; coherence across beats; closure charge moderate. However, the tone label feels author-declared rather than emergent from diction and rhythm, reducing organic integration.</comment>
