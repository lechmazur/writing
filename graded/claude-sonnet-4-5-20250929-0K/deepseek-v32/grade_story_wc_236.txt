<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is established through loss (scentless world, profession stripped) and her present craft demonstrates embodied attention (fingers tracing bronze, reading silence). The visiting woman's grief is mapped concretely, but Elara's response feels more witnessing than active contradiction—her calm remains stable throughout without genuine internal conflict testing her own unresolved healing. The shared vulnerability moment works, yet the protagonist's arc reads as facilitator rather than undergoing pressure that forces a foreclosing choice. Backstory anchors present stance but doesn't tilt a micro-choice that alters later options within this scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through shared grief, polishing ritual, and fog-to-light progression. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the screw reweighted from tool to talisman, Elara's smile a "quiet tremor" that integrates rather than repairs). The cost is conceptual and felt: both women accept incompleteness rather than fix it. Orientation is clean early (shop, morning fog, Elara kneeling). One minor slip: the ending restates theme ("some things are never truly repaired, only integrated") in near-authorial voice when the image already carried it, creating a small redundancy that slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vivid and purposeful: "cave of whispered ticks and liquid sighs," clocks dripping to mark time's passage, bronze reservoir under Elara's fingers. The fog pressing "like a held breath" mirrors emotional suspension and lifts at closure, bracketing the encounter. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's touch-and-sound perception (scentless world forces alternate senses). The screw's tarnish and gleam, the workbench ritual, and the clocks' steady rhythm all ground choices. Micro-setting constraint: the shop's repair context enables the polishing act that reweights the object, charging the final exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the woman's need for symbolic repair/memory honoring, secondary for Elara is her own incomplete healing. The woman's trembling hands and frayed voice establish urgency, and Elara's choice to polish rather than restore function is a meaningful reweighting. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening occurs when Elara shares her own loss, modulating the interaction. However, the escalation is gentle—no true reversal or foreclosed option; Elara's polishing decision feels inevitable from the setup without a competing impulse testing her. Cost is present but oblique: both accept brokenness, yet the protagonist's agency reads more as witnessing than a choice that narrows her own path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (integration over repair, witnessing grief, occluded clarity) emerges organically from the screw's journey, Elara's sensory loss, and the water clocks' relentless drip. The final image—screw as talisman, fog lifting, Elara returning to bronze—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One small slip: "some things were never truly repaired, only integrated" in the penultimate paragraph states the theme when the prior beats and ending image already embodied it, adding a −0.3 thematic echo. The closing lines recover well, keeping the piece from didacticism, but that one articulation slightly undercuts full trust in the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature (touch, sound, "spaces between words") is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but natural ("Tell me," "It doesn't need to clamp anything. It just needs to be held"). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative register. One register slip: "map emotional terrain," "humanize the grief," "occluded view" recur as near-prompt language, nudging into abstract diction that feels less Elara's idiom and more authorial. These terms don't fully break voice but create a slight distance at peak moments, preventing full immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied rhythm; strong images ("fog pressed like a held breath," "canyons of loss, rivers of fear"). However, several patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("occluded view," "maps emotional terrain," "humanize" appear multiple times in close proximity without new meaning); near-duplicate phrasing in the final third (e.g., "ordinary miracles" stated three times, "trembling calm" / "quiet tremor" / "tremor beneath her calm" recycled). Template cadence in the ending paragraphs: "She had learned… She had humanized… She knew…" runs across four sentences. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems that dull momentum in the closure zone, plus minor −0.2 for metaphor register drift ("canyons of loss, rivers of fear" reads slightly elevated). Total artifact penalty ~−1.0, preventing high-band entry and disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (water clock repairer who lost smell, honoring a grief-object rather than fixing it) offers a fresh synthesis. The screw-as-talisman turn and Elara's sensory deprivation as method are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional beats follow a familiar "broken person helps broken person" template, and the resolution (acceptance, integration, witnessing) is a well-worn path in literary short fiction. The water clocks and anosmia details provide texture, but the arc itself does not transform the premise in hindsight; swap the occupation and object, and the emotional logic remains largely intact. No proximity echoes or safety hedging, but insufficient boldness to lift into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (aromatherapist who lost smell) is seeded early, and her sensory deprivation informs her perceptual signature (touch, sound, "spaces between words"). However, her anosmia does not constrain a key choice or tactic on the page; it colors her worldview but doesn't block or enable the decision to polish the screw. She could perform the same witnessing and polishing without this trait. Functional background detail, swappable with "jeweler with damaged vision" or similar. Caps: missing middle development constraint, introduced descriptively but not causally active → cap 4.6. Present in setup and thematically in closure, but no beat where the trait narrows options → score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw appears when the woman places it on the counter (~20% mark), drives the central beat (Elara polishing it), and returns gleaming in the woman's palm at closure, reweighted from tool to talisman. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Two distinct beats: placement/story-telling, polishing ritual. Causal pressure: the screw's history and worn threads motivate Elara's choice to honor rather than restore. Closure linkage strong. Swappability low—its obstetric origin ties to the stillborn daughter's story and charges the "hold not clamp" line. Minor friction: the screw is handled more than used; Elara polishes it but we don't see her examine the threads or test fit, keeping interaction slightly abstract. Score 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" appears as label twice ("read between the lines of her silence," "reading between the lines" in final paragraph) and shapes Elara's interpretive stance—she infers the woman's grief from trembling hands and frayed voice. This perceptual method enables the polishing choice (honoring unspoken need). Present in setup (her repair method), middle (reading the woman's silence), and closure (continues to read between lines). However, the mechanics remain vague; we don't see Elara notice a specific contradiction or omission that she must decode—she simply listens to the told story. The concept is more theme than tactic. Gates: setup, middle interpretive move, closure echo. Causal role modest. Score 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is stated as Elara's method ("she began to read… map the emotional terrain—the canyons of loss, rivers of fear") and recurs in the ending. It colors her perceptual approach but does not constrain or enable a discrete action with cost; she maps the woman's grief and responds with polishing and shared story, but the mapping itself is descriptor rather than active choice-point. Present by mid-scene, thematically in closure, but no beat where this trait forecloses an option or provides a unique resource. Lyric reprise from early to late reweights slightly. Gates: setup, thematic closure presence; missing middle constraint. Swappable with "reads emotional states" or "intuits pain." Score 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Humanize" is Elara's goal ("sought to humanize the pain," "she had humanized the grief, not by fixing it, but by witnessing it"). It frames her choice to share her own loss and polish the screw with ritual care rather than dismiss or clinically repair. Present in setup (her repair ethos), drives the middle beat (speaking of her own loss, polishing), and returns at closure. The action is tied to major turns but reads somewhat abstract—"humanize" could be swapped with "honor," "witness," or "validate" with minimal edit. Causally relevant but not irreplaceable. Gates: all three. Specificity medium. Score 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is named twice (once mid-scene, once near end: "understanding through occluded views, finding clarity in what was not directly seen"). The fog metaphor supports it, and Elara's method (perceiving via touch/sound, reading silence) exemplifies it. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in beat-specific problem-solving; we don't see her try one interpretation, fail, then adjust via the occluded method. Present thematically throughout, but no distinct beat where using this means (vs. direct questioning) alters the tactic. Gates: setup (her sensory loss), thematic middle and closure presence; missing a discrete middle choice where occluded perception unlocks something direct perception couldn't. Score 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Water clock repair shop is anchored early ("within the hush of morning fog, she knelt in the water clock repair shop"), provides sensory texture (bronze reservoir, ticks, liquid sighs), and houses the workbench where Elara polishes the screw. The clocks mark time throughout ("water clock on the wall marked the hour with a soft gurgle"), creating atmosphere and thematic resonance. The setting enables the repair/ritual but does not constrain a choice (Elara could perform the same act elsewhere). Micro-setting qualification: the workbench and tools are present but not detailed enough to show how their properties shape her method. Gates: setup, middle (workbench use), closure (shop's calm and clocks' drip frame final image). Pressure modest; resource/constraint role medium. Score 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" anchors time in the opening line and recurs: fog presses early, lifts at closure ("morning fog had dissolved into light"). The fog-to-light arc brackets the encounter and supports tone, but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—time feels dilated rather than tracked. No on-page clock pressure or deadline; the water clocks measure abstractly rather than countdown. The woman's urgency is declared but the scene unfolds at contemplative pace. Gates: setup, thematic closure payoff; missing middle time-constraint that alters tactics. Swappable with "early morning stillness" or "dawn quiet." Score 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is Elara's stated aim ("she worked to unveil ordinary miracles," "continued to unveil ordinary miracles" at closure). It motivates her choice to polish the screw and frame it as honoring rather than fixing—an ordinary miracle. Desire is present and consistent but not dramatized with friction; Elara does not face a competing want (e.g., efficiency, refusal, doubt) that tests this motivation. Gates: setup (her ethos), middle (polishing as miracle-unveiling), closure (continues the work). Causal role clear but frictionless; no visible cost or tradeoff tied to pursuing this aim over another. Swappable with "to restore meaning" or "to witness pain." Score 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and controlled: "hush of morning fog," "whispered ticks," "quiet tremor," "trembling calm" recur throughout, modulating with pressure (woman's frayed urgency, Elara's steady ritual, shared breathing). The oxymoron "trembling calm" appears three times in slight variation, charging key moments without becoming static. Tone supports accumulative pressure and charges the final image ("quiet tremor in her calm"). One minor note: near the ending, tone briefly tilts toward exposition ("some things were never truly repaired") before recovering in the last lines. Coherent across beats, modulates with the encounter, and the ending image ("shop trembled with a calm that was both fragile and enduring") lands the tone with cost. Score 7.8.</comment>
