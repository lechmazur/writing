<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arlo's acoustic perception is embodied through specific action (the bowl, the listening, the matched violin tone) and his motivation to "find beauty in the unfinished" drives the core choice to dive and play. The grandmother's backstory about the "world-song" feels purposeful, anchoring his present understanding of the trapped hum. Internal contradiction is light—he moves from perception to solution without visible struggle—and the final choice (playing the note, breaking the seal) arrives smoothly but lacks a felt cost or renunciation that would elevate to high 8s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story holds a single POV across one continuous evening sequence with clear spatial anchoring (hull, rowboat, wreck, greenhouse hatch, return). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard is liberated, the hush gains "counterpoint," and Arlo builds a fire to translate the new song—an image that reweights the opening silence with conceptual and sensory cost (the world remains "unfinished" but now sings). The causal chain is clean: perception → bowl listening → dive → matched tone → seal break → release. One meaningful tightening (the "frail rhythm" escalating to the seal-breaking note) is sufficient for this length, and the ending supplies felt resonance without explicit loss, qualifying as Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and hull-home are vividly particular and constrain Arlo's method: he must row, lower the bowl through a corroded pipe, and aim the violin's vibration through water. The final image—fire on the deck, new song swelling from below—charges closure by marrying setting detail (the wreck-ringed bay) with the thematic release. Sensory hierarchy (citrus scent, the "deep breath" groan, leaf-whisper) reflects urgency and reflects the POV's acoustic focus, and spatial choreography (rowboat, hatch, surface) remains clear across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unbinding the trapped orchard's "fruitless song"—is signaled early and tightens when Arlo hears the "desperate, rising hum." His agency (dive, play the matched note) drives the resolution, and the seal-break supplies a visible outcome. The greenhouse's waterlogged confinement is a credible constraint, and the release (warm air, insects, buds) offers a felt shift. Missing is a trade-off or visible price paid by Arlo himself; the liberation happens without personal cost or renunciation, capping entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the "chronic hush" holding "stifled echoes," the grandmother's teaching that songs "get stuck," and the final counterpoint between silence and the orchard's renewed chorus. The ending offers a non-literal answer—beauty is found "by helping it to finish itself"—without a stated moral, and the fire/water pairing (bonfire tradition, sunken song) reweights the opening loss with quiet resonance. The story resists tidy resolution (the hush persists, now with a companion song) and avoids thematic echo or prompt-like language in the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and acoustically attuned: "thick tapestry of stifled echoes," "the magnificent simplicity of a single intention." Distance remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping, and diction stays within a poetic register appropriate to the narrator's sensibility. The prose occasionally leans ornamental ("a single greenhouse, ringed by skeletal ships, singing again into the dark") without obscuring causality, and perceptual signature—hearing "not just sound but the memory of sound"—is character-specific. Filter verbs ("he heard," "he knew") are sparse and voice-motivated, and the final reflection ("he listened, and it was enough") lands cleanly without thesis-stating.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (the bowl's dual role, the pipe mechanic, the matched tone), and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language clusters in some beats ("thick tapestry," "private symphony," "fruitless song") but remains coherent and does not muddle peak action (the dive and violin sequence are clear). Minor register drift: "magnificent simplicity" and "delicate chorus" edge toward elevated diction but stay within the established lyric voice. Sentence openings vary, and the final image (fire, song, listening) integrates earlier motifs without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The post-fire setting, sunken greenhouse, and acoustic unbinding offer a specific synthesis—combining ecological loss, sensory perception, and musical agency—that feels fresh. The violin-as-key and the bowl-as-listening-tool are purposeful rather than ornamental. The emotional arc (listening → understanding → liberation) is recognizable but grounded in particular detail (corroded pipe, matched pitch, warm citrus air). The piece does not take structural risks beyond its lyric accumulation, and the grandmother's teaching borders on a wisdom-keeper trope, though her phrasing ("the note that is trying to be born") integrates thematically rather than as a checklist flourish.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlo appears in every beat: he listens via the bowl, dives to the hatch, plays the matched tone that breaks the seal, and builds the closing fire. His choices—lowering the bowl, swimming down, selecting the pitch—drive all three turns (discovery of the hum, the seal-break, the fire translation). Causal pressure, beat involvement (four distinct actions), and closure linkage (he plays the liberated song on deck) are all present. Cost is oblique (no personal sacrifice shown), capping the score shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bowl is used in two beats: lowered on a cord to hear the greenhouse (setup), then "now full of this new, living resonance" after the release (closure reprise). Its function as listening tool is specific and irreplaceable in method. It does not constrain a middle choice or apply visible cost, and the final mention is brief. Early signal, two-beat involvement, and closure reprise support mid-6s; lack of development pressure or cost caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "chronic hush" frames the opening ("that hush was deepest"), shapes Arlo's perception ("thick tapestry of stifled echoes"), and persists at closure ("not gone, but it now had a counterpoint"). It alters tactics: Arlo must listen for the note "trying to be born" within the silence. The concept drives the dominant stake (unbinding trapped sound) and reweights at the end (silence now coexists with song). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure integration justify low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" enables the bowl-listening and the matched-pitch solution; without it, Arlo could not hear "the memory of sound" or identify the seal-breaking frequency. The trait appears early ("hearing not just sound but the memory of sound") and constrains method (he must listen, then play). Cost is implicit (the skill demands patient attention) but not dramatized as a trade-off. Setup, development, and closure participation present; lack of visible on-page cost caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unbind" is named explicitly ("what he had to unbind"), drives the dive and the violin action, and delivers the climax: "the seal broke... the unbinding of sound." The action is irreplaceable—no synonym fits the story's logic of releasing trapped song. Early signal (the grandmother's teaching: "to unbind it, you must listen"), causal pressure (the hum compels the dive), and closure presence (the seal-break and the fire translation) are all strong. The final image recharges the concept ("helping it to finish itself"). Minor weakness: the unbinding itself is smooth, lacking a visible struggle or cost that would push into 8.8+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bonfire tradition appears in the backstory ("His family's tradition had been storytelling around a bonfire") and returns at closure when Arlo builds "a small fire on the deck" and plays the orchard's song instead of telling a story with words. Setup and payoff are present; the middle lacks development (the tradition does not constrain his dive or violin choice). The lyric reprise reweights the lost ritual with a new form (music over words), but the method itself (bonfire storytelling) does not shape tactics. Lyric-resonance allowance supports low-6s; lack of mid-scene use and causal pressure caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse and shipwreck ring appear in every beat: Arlo rows to the "central wreck that capped the greenhouse," lowers the bowl through the roof pipe, dives to the hatch, and the final image places the fire "above" the singing water, "ringed by skeletal ships." The setting supplies the core constraint (sealed hatch, waterlogged roots) and the resolution mechanic (water carries vibration to the dome). Spatial choreography is precise and the setting charges the ending. Early signal, three-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure charge, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the rainforest burned") anchors the world's state and the "chronic hush" that motivates Arlo. It appears early and recurs in the grandmother's memory and the closing image (the hush "now had a counterpoint"). The fire's aftermath does not tighten a live deadline or alter tactics within this evening's sequence; it provides thematic context rather than causal pressure. Setup and thematic closure reprise are present; lack of escalation pressure or cost caps at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation—"to find beauty in the unfinished"—is stated early and dramatized in action: he rows nightly to listen, interprets the greenhouse hum as beauty "trying to live," and unbinds it. The final line ("He had found the beauty by helping it to finish itself") directly ties the desire to the closure without being a mere restatement. Friction between want and cost is light (he acts without visible sacrifice), but the motivation drives every choice. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage justify high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone—"magnificent simplicity"—is established via the prose's lyric restraint, the single-note violin solution, and the phrasing "the magnificent simplicity of a single intention." It modulates appropriately (quiet observation → decisive action → resonant closure) and charges the final image (modest fire, deep song, listening). The piece avoids overwrought drama, maintaining coherence through pressure. Strong tone control and closure charge support mid-7s; minor ornamental drift in some figurative clusters prevents higher bands.</comment>
