<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation ("to give names to nameless fears") anchors his actions, and the backstory of allowing a soul to pass unreaped provides a wound that charges the ritual. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("His heart, a weight of centuries") and summary-level grief rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final act of folding the atlas page registers as endurance with cost, but the choice feels predetermined rather than tested by competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through scattered light refracting fears into crystals, building density toward the final image of the folded page enclosing temporary forms. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (reaper, observatory, dusk, after finding recordings). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the ritual acknowledges sacrifice rather than merely collecting it—but the cost remains largely told ("His heartbreak remained") rather than shown as a tangible forfeiture. The Cost Proof Test is borderline: the line "the first stars appeared… distant and intimate all at once" offers thematic resonance, but no sentence makes the price of this act unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early with concrete detail (marble table, prism on podium, high dome). The prism and scattered light constrain the method of crystallization, and the atlas page serves as the receptor surface for the named fears. Sensory detail is filtered through the reaper's purpose (colored rays, glistening forms), and the setting's twilight progression marks the ritual's temporal boundary. The micro-setting (prism, light, page) directly enables the closure action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to name nameless fears and thus acknowledge sacrifice. The ritual deepens through the crystallization process (Abyssong, Silenthea), each named fear a small tightening. However, no reversal tests the reaper's commitment; the process unfolds without opposition or internal friction that forces a trade-off. The cost—that the crystals "would sublime with the dawn"—lands as information rather than a felt price that alters his stance. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present but the pressure never narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the act of naming transforms harvesting into acknowledgment. The "echo of sacrifice" integrates through the crystallization ritual rather than overt statement, and the final image of enclosing temporary crystals offers quiet resonance. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary ("the echo of sacrifice had been acknowledged, not just collected"), and the closing epiphany ("no longer echoing, simply remembering") tips into abstraction. The piece resists moralizing but flirts with theme-stating in its final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with perceptual signature shaped by the reaper's duty and loss. Diction remains controlled ("monuments to forgotten watchings," "unnatural geology"), and the voice modulates subtly from grieving observer to active ritualist. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing ("dusk bled across the sky," "violet gloom") that reads more decorative than character-specific. Free indirect access to the reaper's interiority is clean, but the final paragraph's summary cadence ("simply remembering") flattens voice under pressure rather than tightening it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "The fears swirled like fog, formless and choking" is restated in "nameless fears" and "give names to nameless"; the concept of "echo" recurs without added pressure across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence: "First came… Next, the fear of… Each named fear dropped…" in the crystallization sequence. Filter verbs ("knew," "looked upon") appear at closure beats, dulling immediacy. Overwriting: figurative language ("weight of centuries," "bled across the sky," "violet gloom") clusters in the opening and closing without pattern-teaching. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—a reaper naming fears through light refraction—synthesizes grief ritual with crystallography in a non-obvious way. The atlas page with sea monsters as substrate for crystallized fears is specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc (heartbreak → penance → fragile peace) follows a familiar template, and the story does not transform this pattern through lived detail or moral complexity that resists summary. The "forbidden mercy" backstory reads as a stock motivator. Within-category, the piece commits to its premise without gimmickry, earning mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper is present throughout and drives the ritual from start to finish. His decision to crystallize fears creates the story's action, and the backstory of allowing a soul to pass unreaped charges his motivation. However, no on-page choice tests or alters his course; the ritual proceeds without friction. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (finding recordings, angling prism, folding page; +1.4), closure linkage (he encloses crystals; +0.9). Swappability penalty: the reaper's grief could be replaced by another figure's penance with minor edits (−0.6). Label-only interiority (−0.3). Base ~3.0 + 2.8 − 0.9 + adjustment = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atlas page with sea monsters is signaled in paragraph eight, handled when lifted into scattered light, and reappears at closure when folded to enclose crystals. It serves as the receptor surface for named fears, grounding the ritual in tangible form. Setup gate (~40% mark; borderline), development (enables crystallization; +0.9), closure linkage (encloses crystals; +1.2), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (provides substrate; +0.8). Late first appearance (−0.4). Base ~3.0 + 3.8 − 0.4 + adjustment = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "echo of sacrifice" is invoked early ("an echo of sacrifice he was ordained to collect") and charges the reaper's motivation throughout. The concept shapes his need to name fears and reappears at closure ("the echo of sacrifice had been acknowledged"). However, it remains largely thematic rather than constraining on-page choices; no tactic shifts because of it. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (motivation, crystallization, closure summary; +1.4), closure linkage (acknowledged in penultimate paragraph; +0.9), causal pressure (motivates ritual but does not narrow options; +0.5). Thematic rather than tactical (−0.5), summary-only at closure (−0.3). Base ~3.0 + 3.4 − 0.8 + adjustment = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The attribute "echoes forgotten phrases" is dramatized on the page: the reaper speaks ghostly voices ("Remember the price," "The light will not hold") during the ritual, and these echoes crystallize into named fears. The trait enables the crystallization method and returns at closure ("The forgotten phrases ceased their echo within him"). Early signal (paragraph eleven; +0.5), two beats (speaking phrases, phrases ceasing; +0.9), closure linkage (phrases laid to rest; +1.0), causal pressure (enables naming; +0.9), cost (phrases exhausted; +0.4). Base ~3.0 + 3.7 + adjustment = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Crystallize" is the story's central action: the reaper uses scattered light to give solid form to nameless fears, and the ritual produces sapphire-like shards (Abyssong, Silenthea). This action defines the plot's method and payoff. Early signal (paragraph eighteen; +0.6), three beats (intention, first fear, second fear; +1.4), closure linkage (crystals enclosed in page; +1.3), causal pressure (transforms echoes into tangible forms; +1.2), specificity (unique mechanics; +0.6). Base ~3.0 + 5.1 + adjustment = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is introduced midway ("to work through scattered light") and immediately dramatized: the reaper angles the prism, fractures the beam, and plays colored rays over the atlas page to enable crystallization. The method shapes the ritual's execution. Setup at ~60% (−0.3), development (prism angling enables crystallization; +1.1), closure linkage (light fades as sun sets, ending the ritual; +1.0), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (light is the medium of transformation; +1.0), specificity (prism mechanics matter; +0.5). Base ~3.0 + 4.5 − 0.3 + adjustment = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "ancient observatory at dusk" is anchored in the opening line and provides both setting and temporal frame. The prism on the central podium and the high dome with open roof enable the ritual by admitting sunlight, and dusk's progression creates a ticking clock. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (arrival, prism use, stars appearing; +1.4), closure linkage (first stars frame final image; +0.8), causal pressure (sunlight required; +0.7), cost (ritual must finish before full dark; +0.3). Postcard phrasing ("dusk bled across the sky"; −0.3). Base ~3.0 + 3.9 − 0.3 + adjustment = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After finding the old recordings" is stated in paragraph four and motivates the ritual, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions. The recordings provide content (pleas, final words) but no urgency; the reaper could perform this ritual at any moment after discovery. Setup (+0.4), one beat (motivation; +0.4), swappability (timeframe could be "after centuries of grief" with no structural change; −0.7), summary-only (told rather than dramatized; −0.5). Missing development and closure gates cap at 2.8, but lyric-resonance allowance applies (recordings appear at closure when page is placed upon them; +2.0 allowance). Base ~3.0 + 0.8 − 1.2 + 2.0 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To give names to nameless fears" is stated explicitly in paragraph six and drives every beat of the ritual. The motivation is consistent and shapes the reaper's actions (angling prism, whispering phrases, naming Abyssong and Silenthea). However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, and no cost tests his commitment. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (declaration, naming Abyssong, naming Silenthea; +1.4), closure linkage (motivation fulfilled; +0.9), causal pressure (drives ritual; +0.8). Told-only (−0.6), no friction (−0.4). Base ~3.0 + 3.7 − 1.0 + adjustment = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Distant intimacy" is embodied throughout: the reaper is spatially and temporally removed from the dead yet performs an intimate ritual of naming. The tone is signaled early ("shared secret with the dead, yet framed by an uncrossable distance") and modulates subtly as dusk deepens, holding coherence through the closure image ("distant and intimate all at once"). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (ritual framing, crystallization, final stars; +1.4), closure linkage (final line crystallizes tone; +1.4), causal pressure (tone shapes perception of cost; +0.6), specificity (paradox charges final image; +0.5). Base ~3.0 + 4.6 + adjustment = 7.3.</comment>
