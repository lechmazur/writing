<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a label-only sentimentalist throughout; no contradictory impulses act in scene, no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Her motivation ("to share light without using fire") is stated and restated but never tested by a competing desire or cost that would force her to choose between them. The gear-ancestors receive more interior weight than Elara's present struggle. The "troubling serenity" is declared but never embodied through action or perception that degrades under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (lyric structure, pattern-taught recurrence, cadence modulation). Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when). However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elara's transit proceeds without obstacle—she "paused" at a void, consulted the gear, adjusted sonar, then "emerged" into the clearing. The closure image pools light and spreads it, but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the mission was always feasible and completes as planned. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Elara gave up, risked, or lost to achieve shared illumination.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly rendered through sensory selection (luminescent gas, ionized petals, radiant clearing) and the sonar-ping method concretizes navigation in the void. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or force a tactical trade-off. The "dense cluster of ionized petals" appears, Elara adjusts sonar, and she passes through without cost or difficulty. The gear and sonar qualify as micro-setting tools but are used to solve rather than complicate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: reach the core and share light without fire. Yet no meaningful tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens. The sonar distortion/void could have forced a choice between speed and safety, or between fidelity to the ancestors' method and her own sentiment, but Elara simply recalculates and continues. The gear "approximated infinity to show that even voids were part of the cycles"—an insight that resolves tension rather than escalating it. No on-page trade-off or foreclosed option; the final image is achievement without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical infinity and light-without-fire emerges through image and recurrence, not direct statement—positive. The gear and ancestors provide historical weight. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it states the mission fulfilled and cycles renewed in nearly declarative summary. "In the end, the troubling serenity was not a burden, but a balance" and "And so, the cycles continued" are thematic echo statements that replace earned resonance. The final third drifts into sermonizing ("a testament to the approximation of infinity") rather than a charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (sonar echoes, luminescent clouds) but uniform across emotional beats—no modulation under pressure. Diction elevates into abstraction ("approximation of infinity," "generational tapestry," "empathetic waves") that reads more like exposition than Elara's lived thought. The prose lacks rhythmic variance or character-particular syntax; sentence stems recur ("She [verb]," "The gear [verb]," "Elara [verb]"). Filter verbs ("watched," "remembered," "felt") stack without voice motivation in the final passage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across most paragraphs without taught pattern or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "to share light without using fire" recurs five times with minimal variation; "generational patterns" and "approximation of infinity" loop through summary rather than fresh detail. Stock metaphors (falling petals as time, light as knowledge) lack specificity. The scaffold is visible: nearly every paragraph begins with Elara's name or a definite article, creating drumbeat monotony. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("across the quiet sigh of falling petals" repeated in final lines), triggering the −1.7 artifact deduction and 9+ disallow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core synthesis—sentimentalist navigator using sonar and relic gear in a nebula—has promise, but execution defaults to template lyricism: light/dark, memory/future, acceptance/burden. The transformation test fails: replace "nebula garden" with "ancient forest" and "sonar" with "echolocation," and the emotional arc (journey → obstacle → acceptance) persists unchanged. "Troubling serenity" and "quiet sigh of falling petals" are poetic but generic. No bold risk or non-obvious angle elevates the premise beyond the prompt checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but makes no choices that alter tactics; she observes, remembers, adjusts sonar when prompted by data, and achieves her goal as planned. Label-only sentimentalist; no on-page decision under competing pressure. Missing middle development (no choice constrained by the trait) and closure participation (she "watched" rather than acted at the end). Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; late −0.3 for ornamental trait label.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The gear is cradled (first beat), consulted when the void appears (second beat), and extended as a conduit in the clearing (closure beat). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the gear's mechanics are abstract ("approximates infinity," "calculations aligning") and it solves rather than complicates—each use removes friction. Swappability moderate: another relic-tool with memory/data function would serve similarly. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability −0.6, ornamental abstraction −0.5, and resolves-without-creating −0.6 yield mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Generational patterns are discussed throughout (nebulae birth stars, cycles repeat) and frame Elara's mission, meeting setup. They inform the sonar + gear method (middle development) and are invoked in the final paragraph (closure participation). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the concept remains thematic backdrop; it does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page. The void's "temporary absence" insight deepens understanding but does not alter Elara's tactics. Swappability high: "eternal cycles" or "cosmic memory" would function identically. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.4, but summary-only −0.7, theme-claim-only −0.3, swappability −0.7 lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The attribute "approximates infinity" is assigned to the gear and mentioned six times, meeting setup and appearing in closure lines. However, it functions as a label for what the gear does rather than a constraint or enabler of action with cost. No on-page trade-off (e.g., accuracy vs. speed, finite data vs. infinite pattern) tied to approximation. Missing middle development as a causal pressure. Late first functional mention (void scene, past midpoint) −0.3, label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.3, no cost −0.4, cap at swappability 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Transit structures the entire narrative: Elara begins in the nebula garden, moves through the cluster, and emerges at the core. Setup immediate, middle beats involve navigating the void and cluster (development), and the final clearing marks arrival (payoff). All three gates met. However, transit is continuous and uncontested; it does not redefine options or force a sacrifice. Swappability moderate: "journey," "passage," or "descent" would serve with minor edits. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability −0.6, no causal pressure −0.4 yield upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced early ("soft pulses that painted the void"), used to navigate the void (middle beat), and fades in the clearing as the mission shifts to resonance (closure participation). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Mechanics matter: focused beams map the cluster, demonstrating method specificity. However, sonar never fails or imposes cost; it provides data that the gear then interprets without friction. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (fade-out) +0.5, specificity +0.4, but resolves-without-creating −0.7, no cost −0.4 yield upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is present throughout, meeting setup and closure participation. Gas clouds, ionized petals, and the radiant clearing provide vivid setting. However, the garden does not pressure choices; Elara moves through it without spatial constraint or resource scarcity forcing a trade-off. The "dense cluster" could have imposed cost (e.g., sonar attenuation, time delay) but is overcome by adjustment. Early signal +0.6, closure presence +0.5, two distinct locations (garden span, core clearing) +0.9, but postcard-description mode −0.7, no choice constraint −0.6 yield mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" recurs throughout and is present in the final lines (setup and closure participation met). However, time remains vague and untracked; no clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. Elara pauses, adjusts, and emerges with no sense of duration or deadline. The phrase functions as lyric decoration rather than a story constraint. Missing middle development (no time-driven choice). Early signal +0.4, closure presence +0.4, but vague/untracked −0.8, ornamental −0.6, cap at 2.8 for missing development, raised slightly by closure lyric reprise to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to share light without using fire" is stated in the opening and restated throughout, meeting setup. It informs her method (sonar + gear instead of ancestor's "fire") in the middle and frames the final image (soft luminescence vs. burn). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the motivation is never tested by a competing desire or cost; no on-page moment where speed, efficiency, or safety tempts her to "use fire" or abandon the mission. Told-only friction (ancestors scarred the cosmos) but no present-tense conflict. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only −0.8, no on-page friction −0.7, summary-only −0.5 yield mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone "troubling serenity" is signaled early ("beauty held in a troubling serenity") and invoked at closure ("the troubling serenity settled into a peaceful acceptance"). Setup and payoff met. The oxymoron is apt for the nebula's dual nature (beauty/sorrow, joy/loss). However, tone remains static across beats; no modulation under pressure when Elara encounters the void or navigates the cluster. The final shift to "peaceful acceptance" is declared rather than charged through image. Early signal +0.5, closure presence +0.7, coherence +0.4, but static mood −0.6, declared shift −0.5 yield low-5s.</comment>
