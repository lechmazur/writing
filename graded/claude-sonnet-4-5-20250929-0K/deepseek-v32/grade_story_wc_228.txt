<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and his artistic motivation tracks consistently, but the transformation arc feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The "intimately aloof" trait is mentioned twice but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—it remains label-only. The revelation scene ("slow, dawning clarity") arrives through contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final peace reads as delivered rather than wrestled from prior causality. The painter's choice to leave the shell on the pedestal carries thematic weight but lacks the felt cost that would elevate the arc into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when); the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a single meaningful deepening when Elian discovers the cave and painted shell. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he leaves the shell and returns home with newfound peace—but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally legible on the page. The wrong-turn complication and cave discovery feel convenient rather than earned by prior choices, and the tightening is modest: the narrative accumulates atmosphere and symbolic weight but does not narrow options or raise stakes with undeniable pressure. The final image reweights prior material, satisfying the lens, but lacks the persistent constraint or felt price that would push this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave is vividly rendered with bioluminescent walls, still water, and crystal formations; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's painter's eye. The cave setting constrains his physical access (tide turning, entrance submerging) and charges the final choice to leave the shell, meeting the 9+ quick test for environment shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (quay → cliffs → ledge → cave mouth → cavern → pedestal). Minor deduction: the quay itself is mentioned but never shown on the page with specificity that would ground Elian's decades of work there, and the "obscured entrance" arrives via coincidence rather than motivated search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find a truth worthy of his ultimate canvas"—is signaled early and remains coherent, but pressure does not escalate meaningfully under the Accumulative lens. The cave discovery and painted shell deepen understanding without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off with visible cost. Elian's agency is passive (he stumbles into the cave via wrong turn, contemplates, paints, leaves)—the sequence reads as witness rather than protagonist driving reversals. The final act of leaving the shell carries thematic resonance but lacks the felt price or foreclosed path that would meet the 8+ guardrail. No antagonist or live conflict tests his commitment; the transformation is internal and contemplative, fitting the lens but lacking escalation with undeniable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the painted shell, the still pool, the turning tide all embody "temporary eternity" without overt statement. The final image—Elian walking home with the memory as a "sacred interlude"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of capturing the ephemeral. Minor deductions: the phrase "temporary eternity" appears twice in on-page narration (second paragraph: "temporary eternity," fifth paragraph: "temporary eternity framed by stone"), edging toward thematic echo, and the closing lines ("The promise was kept, not in stone, but in the fleeting, perfect language of water and light") veer close to moralizing summary. The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces complexity, but the final paragraph's accumulation of abstract nouns ("revelation," "interlude," "echo of eternity") tilts toward assertion rather than trusting the prior image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (painter's eye marveling at detail, "intimately aloof passion"). Diction remains within Elian's plausible lexicon with minor slips: "sacrament," "sacred interlude," and "conceptual" phrasing in the final third read slightly elevated for a solitary painter mid-revelation. No dialogue is present (correctly, given the solitary scene). Psychic distance is controlled, and free indirect style is clean. Minor penalty for modest register drift in the closing paragraph ("the quiet revelation of that underground world," "fleeting, perfect language") that edges toward essayistic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries multiple line-level artifacts. Paraphrase loops: "hidden promise" (paragraphs 1, 5, 10), "intimately aloof" (paragraphs 1, 6—label recycled without new pressure), "temporary eternity" (paragraphs 4, 6—conceptual redundancy). Template cadence in paragraph 10: "He walked home... The memory of the cave... The promise was kept..." (three consecutive summary stems). Stock metaphors: "breath stolen," "heart anchored," "deeply drawn clarity," "echo of eternity." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 4: "realized," "felt," "understood" across four lines. Final-third artifacts ("sacred interlude," "echo of eternity," "language of water and light") dull the closure image with abstract phrasing. Apply patterned-artifact pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for filter stack; total deduction ~−1.1, landing score in mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeking truth discovers painted artifact in hidden cave—is familiar (quest-for-meaning template) and not transformed through non-obvious synthesis. The painted shell as mise en abyme (artwork within artwork) is a well-worn device; Elian's realization about ephemerality reads as the expected thematic payoff rather than a surprising inevitability. Specificity is present in the cave's bioluminescence and crystal ceiling, but the emotional arc and symbolic logic follow predictable beats: search → discovery → contemplation → peaceful return. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece plays it safe within literary-fiction conventions. Derivative premise guardrail applies: template plot without strong transformation suggests mid-band placement; no proximity echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choice to leave the shell on the pedestal shapes the closure image. Setup: established in opening lines. Development: his decision to venture east and enter the cave drives the middle, though the cave discovery is via wrong turn (coincidence) rather than agency. Closure: leaving the shell is an active choice with thematic cost (letting go). Two beats (venture east, leave shell) with modest causal pressure. Swappability: another artist-seeker would function similarly with minor edits. Deductions for passive discovery and modest irreplaceability place score in mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: painted seashell introduced at end of paragraph 3 (~40% mark, late but within tolerance). Development: Elian retrieves it, studies its detail, and it catalyzes his revelation about transience (paragraph 4–5). Closure: he places it back on the pedestal in paragraph 9, completing the sacrament. Three distinct beats (discovery, contemplation, return) with causal and thematic pressure. The shell's painted quay detail is specific and irreplaceable, charging the final image. Late introduction (−0.3) and modest mid-scene use (contemplation is interior, not physically dramatized action) prevent higher score, but closure linkage and specificity earn solid 7-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "temporary eternity" named explicitly in paragraph 4. Development: the concept is thematized in paragraph 6 ("temporary eternity framed by stone") but does not constrain tactics—Elian paints because he always paints, not because this concept changes his options. Closure: the theme echoes in the final lines but remains abstract. The concept shapes the story's theme but not its stakes or on-page choices. Label-only presence without causal pressure or cost caps score at functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setup: "intimately aloof" introduced in paragraph 1. Development: repeated in paragraph 6 ("intimately aloof passion") but never constrains or enables an action with cost—it remains a descriptive label. Closure: absent. The trait describes Elian's manner but does not shape his choices or tactics. No visible tradeoff or friction tied to this attribute on the page. Ornamental use with no causal work places score in low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: Elian's decision to "finally act" on his hidden promise in paragraph 1 frames the quest. Development: the cave discoveries and painted shell "reveal" the truth he sought (paragraph 5). Closure: the revelation is complete and he returns home transformed. The reveal is central to the thematic arc and shapes the ending's charge. Two gates (setup, closure) with thematic causal pressure. Deductions: the reveal is passive (he finds, he realizes) rather than earned through active pursuit, and the mechanics are coincidental (wrong turn). Swappability test: another form of revelation (mentor, vision, different artifact) could serve similarly. Mid-6 band for thematic presence without irreplaceable causal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: wrong turn onto "treacherous, shale-strewn ledge" in paragraph 2 leads to the cave entrance. Development: the method delivers the hidden oasis (paragraph 3) that catalyzes the revelation. Closure: not present in ending. The wrong turn is signaled and its result (cave discovery) is essential to the plot, meeting two gates. Deduction: the mechanics are coincidental rather than earned—Elian "missed the worn path" without prior choice pressure that would make the error feel inevitable. The oasis is hidden and wondrous but does not constrain tactics beyond tidal urgency. One major beat (discovery) with modest causal necessity places score in mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: cave entrance discovered in paragraph 2; cavern detailed in paragraph 3. Development: the cave's bioluminescence guides Elian inward, the still pool reflects the crystals, and the natural pedestal holds the shell—all environmental features that shape his experience and choices. Closure: the turning tide forces his departure (paragraph 9), and the cave memory "breathes through every stroke" in the final paragraph. Three beats (entry, painting, departure) with spatial and temporal constraint (tide). The cave setting is irreplaceable and charges the final image. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure with environmental pressure on tactics earns high-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup: "after the mirror cracks" anchors the story's temporal frame in the opening paragraph. Development: not tracked—no sense of hours passing or urgency tied to the timeframe. Closure: the cracked mirror is revisited thematically in paragraph 10 ("now seemed not a warning, but an invitation") but does not constrain decisions. The timeframe provides a symbolic before/after but does not tighten tactics or choices on the page. Two gates (setup, thematic closure callback) with no developmental pressure place score at functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "hidden promise he had made to himself years prior" introduced in paragraph 1. Development: the promise is invoked in paragraph 5 ("His hidden promise had been to find a truth") and again in paragraph 6 ("serving only the promise"). Closure: paragraph 9 declares "The promise was kept" and the final paragraph reinforces it. The motivation frames the quest and is present at closure, but the promise itself is told rather than dramatized—we never see the moment of making it or the friction between competing wants. Three beats (setup, invocation during painting, closure declaration) with thematic but not causal pressure. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake but lacks on-page friction or visible cost tied to keeping versus breaking the promise places score in mid-6 band.</comment>
