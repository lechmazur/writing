<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is declared (cure loneliness) but his interior life remains thin and generic. The "desperately jocular manner" is told repeatedly ("forced smile," "thin veneer") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. The woman's laugh "cutting through his jocular desperation" and the candle exchange offer a moment of texture, but the arc from hollow ache to "genuine amusement" reads as summary rather than earned transformation with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("foundational disaster," "existential dread") and the final softening lacks the friction and foreclosed options required for credible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the gathering, rumor chains, and token exchanges, culminating in a final image of the moon rock on a map. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the station transforms from transit/goodbye to connection hub), but the cost remains abstract: no on-page price is legible in the final beat. The story teaches its pattern early (rumor, reciprocity, fragment passing hand to hand), yet the ending dissolves loneliness through collective buzz without a visible forfeiture or trade-off. The orientation is clear by ~50 words (Aris, station, moon rock), and the lens holds, but the closure image ("warm from many hands," "paper weight for new plans") asserts change rather than charging it with undeniable pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station is anchored early with vivid, selective detail: iron ribs strangled by ivy, platform as command center, maps pinned under geodesic stones. The setting recurs across beats (ticket booth, platform, pigeons) and the ivy-clad station becomes a symbol of transformation by the end. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop rather than active pressure. The moon rock's "pitted surface" and warmth from many hands offer micro-setting texture, and the station's spatial choreography (crowd, booth, platform) remains coherent, lifting the score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cure loneliness—is signaled early and pursued through rumor chains and the contact festival. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: people arrive, tokens exchange, conversations spark, the mayor's envoy offers support. Yet no single tightening choice narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The woman's candle and Aris's moon-rock exchange are gestures of reciprocity, not decisions under pressure. The story deepens through accretion (more people, more tokens, sustained effort agreed upon), but the cost remains implicit—no visible price is paid that alters later tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—reciprocity and connection as antidote to loneliness—emerges organically from the moon rock's passage, token exchanges, and the station's transformation. The final image of the rock as "paper weight for new plans" and "polite anarchy reigned" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo: "the cure for loneliness required sustained effort" and "loneliness found its antidote in reciprocity" articulate the thesis rather than trusting the dramatization. The moon rock's shift from talisman to warm communal object and the station's arc from transit to gathering carry thematic weight, but the ending restates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly to Aris throughout; psychic distance is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent, slightly elevated register ("clandestine by necessity," "geodesic stones," "polite anarchy"). The single line of dialogue—Aris's speech about the moon rock—feels natural and advances plot, though brief. Perceptual signature is present (logistician's mapping networks, crowd facilitation) but thin; the narration does not modulate rhythm or diction under pressure. No head-hopping, and filter verbs ("he believed," "he saw," "he felt") are used sparingly. The voice is competent and clear, but lacks the rhythmic control or compression under stress that would elevate into the high 7s or beyond.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and syntax are mostly clean, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is moderate; most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: template cadence runs ("Through improbable rumor chains" opens three paragraphs; "Bound by reciprocity" opens three sentences), paraphrase loops (paragraphs 10–11 restate the rumor-chain mechanism; paragraphs 27–28 echo the festival's spread), and stock metaphors ("thin veneer," "the cure," "polite anarchy" as refrain). The closure beat—moon rock on map, polite anarchy reigned—is not obscured, but the loops and stems dull momentum in the middle third. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops across multiple paragraphs, plus −0.2 for stock metaphor strings ("foundational disaster," "contact festival"), totaling roughly −0.8 in Q7, with artifacts touching multiple beats but not the final image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—disaster-relief logistician treating loneliness as disaster via rumor chains and a contact festival—offers a fresh angle on familiar material (loneliness epidemic, community gathering). The moon rock as astronaut's gift and reciprocity engine provides a specific, non-obvious synthesis. However, execution trends toward the median: the emotional arc (hollow ache → genuine amusement) and plot structure (plan, gather, succeed) follow predictable beats without bold risk or surprise. The "polite anarchy" tone and ivy-strangled station are vivid but do not transform convention. The transformation test is borderline: swap rumor chains for social media and the arc holds. No close echoes of famous lines, but the piece does not push into surprising territory or embrace moral complexity beyond "connection cures loneliness."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris (elusive disaster-relief logistician) is present throughout and his actions—greeting, facilitating introductions, offering the moon rock, agreeing to city support—drive the gathering. However, his choices do not create key turns; people arrive via rumor chains (method), and the festival's success feels inevitable rather than contingent on his decisions. He is active but not decisively so; the plot could proceed with a generic organizer. Present by first paragraph (setup ✓), shapes middle facilitation (development ✓), and agrees to future gatherings at the end (closure participation ✓), but the final agreement is reactive rather than transformative. Functional but replaceable; his occupation flavors the premise without constraining choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moon rock fragment is introduced in paragraph 4, handled on-page (Aris feels its pitted surface, holds it up, passes it to the woman, it returns warm), and reappears in the final beat as paperweight on the map. It constrains the woman's exchange (bound by reciprocity, she gives the candle) and catalyzes the chain reaction of token-sharing. The fragment's warmth from many hands reweights its meaning from lonely astronaut's gift to communal symbol. Present early (setup ✓), enables middle exchange (development ✓), and charges the final image (closure ✓). Causal pressure moderate (+0.9 for two distinct beats: woman's exchange, final paperweight), closure linkage strong (+1.2), specificity solid (+0.5: pitted surface, astronaut origin). No major frictions; late first touch (paragraph 4, ~15%) applies −0.2. Rounds to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reciprocity is signaled early (paragraph 5: "core concept that bound his network") and dramatized in the woman's candle-for-moon-rock exchange and the mayor's envoy offering city support in exchange for advice. The concept shapes the token-passing cascade and the final agreement, altering tactics (people share rather than hoard). Present by first third (setup ✓), enables middle token exchanges (development ✓), and the envoy's exchange participates in closure (closure ✓). Causal pressure moderate (+0.7: narrows tactics to mutual aid), closure linkage present (+0.8: envoy exchange), but swappable with "mutual aid" or "gift economy" with minor edits (−0.6). Rounds to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is introduced in paragraph 6 and repeated in paragraphs 13, 23, and 25. It flavors Aris's greeting ("bow and a forced smile," "joke about lost luggage and found souls," "joke about bureaucratic red tape") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The woman's laugh "cutting through his jocular desperation" is an effect, not a tradeoff. The trait is told ("desperately jocular manner," "thin veneer over desperation") rather than embodied in contradictory action. Present early (setup ✓), mentioned in middle jokes (development weak), and noted softening at the end (closure participation weak). Label-only use (−0.6), summary-only (−0.3), no cost tied to trait (−0.5). Caps at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in paragraphs 8, 16, 21, and 24. The action—spark a cascade of human contact—is the story's central engine: Aris catalyzes the festival, the moon rock catalyzes the token chain, the gathering catalyzes a movement. The word itself is decorative, but the action it names drives the arc. The woman's exchange and envoy's offer are catalyzed by Aris's facilitation. Present early (setup ✓), drives middle exchanges (development ✓), and the final paragraph frames the station's revival as a catalyzed movement (closure ✓). Causal pressure high (+1.3: enables multiple beats), closure linkage solid (+1.0), but "spark" or "ignite" could replace with minor edits (−0.5). Rounds to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rumor chains are signaled in paragraph 3 ("method was rumor, woven through improbable chains") and recur in paragraphs 10, 17, 27, and 29. They explain how people arrive and how news spreads, but the mechanics remain vague; we do not see a rumor passed or a chain link dramatized. The method shapes the setup (people drawn by whispers) but does not constrain middle choices. Present early (setup ✓), mentioned as background cause (development weak), and credited in final paragraphs (closure participation weak). Ornamental use (−0.7), summary-only (−0.5), swappable with "word of mouth" (−0.5). Rounds to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The disused railway station is introduced in the opening line and recurs throughout: platform as command center, ivy, ticket booth, pigeons on the platform, station's revival. It provides the gathering's location and symbolic transformation (transit/goodbye → connection hub). The ivy and iron ribs charge the opening image, and the station's hum at the end signals change. Present immediately (setup ✓), supplies the gathering space (development ✓), and the final image places the moon rock on a map at the station (closure ✓). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is backdrop rather than pressure. Causal pressure minimal (+0.3), closure linkage moderate (+0.8), specificity solid (+0.6: ivy, iron ribs, platform, booth). Rounds to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When the story changes" (timeframe) appears in paragraphs 9 and 23. The concept frames the arc (absence → presence, planning → happening), but no live clock tightens decisions. The festival occurs "today," and the story shifts from setup to event to aftermath, yet time remains vague and untracked. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical. Present mid-first-third (setup ✓), noted as shift in paragraph 23 (development weak), and implied in final paragraph's "sustained effort" (closure participation weak). No causal pressure (time does not narrow options), ornamental use (−0.7), late signal (~35%, −0.3), swappable with "turning point" (−0.6). Rounds to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Aris's motivation—"to find the cure for loneliness"—is declared in paragraph 2 and recurs in paragraphs 8, 26, and 32. It drives the festival's conception and Aris's facilitation, and the final paragraph asserts fulfillment. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no scene shows Aris wrestling with cost or doubt. The woman's laugh moment offers friction (real connection cutting through desperation), but the arc from hollow ache to genuine amusement is summary. Present early (setup ✓), drives middle facilitation (development ✓), and closure asserts cure achieved (closure ✓). Causal pressure moderate (+0.8), closure linkage strong (+1.0), but summary-only (−0.5), told motivation (−0.4). Rounds to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is introduced in paragraph 10 and recurs in paragraphs 11, 28, and 33. It describes the festival's tone (no schedules, kindness as currency, chaotic courtesy) and the final state. The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond repetition. The piece teaches the concept early and holds it, but the tone feels declared rather than enacted in rhythm or diction. Present early (setup ✓), frames middle event (development ✓), and final line repeats it (closure participation ✓). Label-only use (−0.6), ornamental mention in closure (−0.3), swappable with "organized chaos" (−0.5). Rounds to 4.8.</comment>
