<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (hushing guilt over misreading a baby's cry) is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains abstract and diagnostic ("dissonance of old guilt") rather than embodied. The revelation that the cry was "a simple hello" and her intervention caused loss is told flatly without dramatized contradiction or mistake visible in the present action. The final integration of guilt into her "life's constellation" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered images and motifs building to a final reconfiguration). Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the meteor hush reweights the lab's purpose and Elara's guilt. However, orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~180 words of metaphor-dense setup ("constellation tattooist," "resonance chambers," "time folding")—triggering a −0.4 penalty. The tethering process provides one meaningful deepening, but the cost (placing amber in the drawer, releasing the sound) is more symbolic than felt; no tactical option is visibly narrowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly rendered with "humming banks," "main resonator," and the amber glowing under diffuse light. Micro-setting (the amber, the antique escritoire) charges the final image. Yet the setting functions primarily as backdrop for metaphor rather than constraining choice: Elara's process (activating amber, tattooing constellation) unfolds without spatial friction or resource limits. The insect turning to face her at the end is evocative but does not alter her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: silencing the haunted firmware and hushing guilt. The tethering process provides one tightening when time folds and past/present overlap, forcing Elara to work faster. Agency is present (she activates amber, tattoos constellation), but the escalation is more textural than tactical—no live resistance forces a trade-off. The "chain of events leading to loss" is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost remains abstract. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow options with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: guilt as integration rather than erasure, sounds released into silence, time's fragility. The amber and meteor hush function as charged motifs that shift meaning across the arc. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct statement ("some sounds are meant to be heard only once, and then released") and the baby's cry resolving as "a simple hello" feels too neat—emotional complexity is smoothed rather than deepened. The conceptual cost (accepting error without fixing it) is legible but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and metaphor-dense ("constellation tattooist," "meteor hush"), lending distinct texture. Distance control is consistent, though the high register ("dissonance," "temporal echoes") occasionally drifts from grounded perception into elevated abstraction. The piece teaches its ornate idiom early and sustains it. Psychic distance narrows effectively when Elara sees the superimposed winter night, but the final lines ("she realized that hushing guilt did not mean erasing it") tip toward tell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("skin-like membranes stretched across resonance chambers," "meteor hush," "time had begun to fold in on itself"), creating atmosphere but occasionally obscuring causal linkage—how exactly does touching amber with a needle produce silence? Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The guilt stemmed from... She possessed the rare attribute... Now, amidst... Her breakthrough came..." (four consecutive scaffold openers). Paraphrase loop: "to hush the dissonance" / "she must use the amber to tether the cry" / "The tethering required her to bind the sound" restates the same action. Deductions: −0.6 for template stems, −0.3 for loop, total −0.9 routed here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustics, time-folding, and guilt redemption through constellation tattooing is specific and non-obvious. The amber as anchor and the haunted firmware are fresh inflections on the "scientist seeking redemption" template. However, the emotional arc (misread cry → discovery of true meaning → peace) follows a familiar trajectory, and the final reconciliation arrives without bold risk or counter-intuitive turn. Transformation is present but moderate; the premise could support sharper stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices (activating amber, tattooing constellation, placing amber in drawer) drive the tethering process and the ending. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (breakthrough, tethering), and closure (placing amber, finding peace). Two distinct beats of active decision. Causal pressure: her actions enable the meteor hush and silence the firmware. Cost is conceptual (accepting guilt as memory) but tied to her agency. Swappability is low; the tattooist role shapes the metaphor and method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber appears early (setup), is activated in the middle beat (silver needle touch produces meteor hush), and returns charged at closure (warm, pulsating, insect facing Elara). Three functional beats. It enables the tethering and produces the sound that translates the cry. The insect's shift at the end reweights its symbolic role. Cost: placing it in the drawer closes the chapter. Specificity is high (insect, resin, first cry); removing it would break the tethering logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early and provides atmospheric pressure (ghostly baby cries loop in background). It reacts during the tethering (projecting shadows) and falls silent at closure. However, its role is reactive rather than causal—it does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a choice. The firmware is more thematic echo than active stake-shaper. Swappable with any persistent auditory haunting. Present across beats but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ability to translate baby cries is Elara's defining trait and the source of her guilt (she failed once). It pays off at closure when the amber lets her hear the cry's true meaning ("not a cry of pain, but of greeting"). Two beats: past failure (backstory) and present revelation (ending). The skill enables the final insight and shapes her motivation throughout. Cost: her error caused loss. However, the trait is not tested or constrained in the present scene—she does not translate a new cry under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tethering structures the entire arc: Elara seeks the method (letters), performs the process (activates amber, tattoos constellation), and achieves closure (time snaps back, firmware silenced). Three beats. The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot. It defines her tactics and the turning point when past/present overlap forces her to work faster. Cost: the tethering binds the sound permanently, foreclosing other options. Specificity is high (constellation mapping frequencies).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The handwritten letters in the antique escritoire provide the tethering method, appearing early (breakthrough beat) and framing the solution. They enable the process and the escritoire returns at closure (amber placed inside, drawer closed). Two beats. However, the letters' mechanics are vague—how do they describe tethering?—and they function more as convenient exposition than constraint. Swappable with any knowledge source (book, mentor, memory). Present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory frames every beat: humming banks, main resonator, worktable, diffuse light. It provides the tools (amber, needle, resonator) and reflects the stakes (lost sounds, time folding). The setting is specific (constellation mapping, firmware) and atmospherically coherent. However, it does not constrain choice—Elara's actions unfold without spatial friction or resource limits. The lab is vivid backdrop rather than active pressure. Micro-setting (amber on worktable) charges the final image slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Time folding is introduced early, escalates at the tethering beat (past/present overlap visibly), and resolves at closure (time snaps back). Three beats. The timeframe creates urgency ("She saw glimpses of that winter night superimposed on the machinery") and forces Elara to work faster. However, the mechanics are abstract—what triggers the folding? what stops it?—and the temporal pressure is more atmospheric than tactical. Cost: the overlap causes haunting but does not foreclose options. Specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Guilt over the misread cry is Elara's singular motivation, stated early and driving every choice: seeking redemption, interpreting the letters, performing the tethering. It is dramatized in the overlap beat (she sees herself, younger and frantic) and resolved at closure (guilt hushed into manageable memory). Three beats. The motivation shapes tactics and charges the final image. Cost: accepting the error without erasing it. Friction between wanting peace and confronting the past is present but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Meteor hush appears late (middle beat, when amber is activated) and defines the closure atmosphere (profound silence, peace). It modulates tone from haunted dissonance to calm and charges the final image ("The meteor hush lingered"). Two beats. The tone is coherent and supports the Accumulative lens. However, "meteor hush" as a phrase is poetic but vague—what does it sound like? feel like?—and its function is more label than lived texture. Present and purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>
