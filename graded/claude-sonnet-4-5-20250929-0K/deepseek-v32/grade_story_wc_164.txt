<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marin's motivation is stated early but never genuinely tested on the page—she collects foam, reads glyphs, and arrives at her insight without any contradictory impulse or foreclosed path. The "vanished path" backstory is invoked but remains abstract; no embodied struggle or micro-choice under pressure emerges. Interiority relies on summary labels ("puzzled," "peaceful") rather than contradictory feelings acting simultaneously. The final smile and rest feel awarded rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: glyphs and whispers layer toward a thematic realization. Orientation is clear early (who, where, what). However, closure hinges on a told epiphany ("paths disappear not because they are erased, but because they transform") with no on-page decisive change, renunciation, or felt cost—Marin simply writes her discovery and rests. The realization does not foreclose an option or reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it announces theme rather than dramatizing reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The iridescent geode cave is vividly anchored and atmosphere is consistent (cheerful gloom recurs). The crater glass and sea-foam are handled across beats, and spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics—Marin's process unfolds without spatial friction. The setting remains a backdrop rather than a pressure source, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never escalates under genuine pressure. Marin encounters a contradictory glyph (sailor's determination vs. her conjecture of regret) yet resolves it via internal musing rather than a forced choice or trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; the "fading glyphs" time pressure dissipates the moment she writes her insight. Agency is notional; the resolution is delivered by reflection, not a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, transience, new beginnings) emerges clearly from recurring images (sea-foam, scattered seeds, iridescent light). The final paragraph, however, cycles through explicit thematic statements ("paths disappear so that others may appear") that replace scene pressure with moralizing. The piece avoids embodied, non-literal resonance at closure. Subtext in the early beats (crater glass mechanics, migrating bird) functions well, but the ending lands as thesis rather than earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable and legible. Diction is consistent with a lyric-fantasy register, and perceptual signature (foam, glyphs, whispers) is coherent. However, sentence stems recur heavily ("She would," "The…," "Marin…") creating template cadence, and key beats rely on filter verbs ("realized," "knew," "thought") that dull immediacy. No dialogue is present. Voice remains functional but lacks rhythmic control under pressure and shows minor scaffold patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clarity is high and grammar clean, but the prose exhibits multiple artifact patterns: paraphrase loops (e.g., paragraphs 26–27 restate "paths disappear to make way for new journeys" and "dissolve into new beginnings"), template cadence runs ("The…" openers cluster heavily), and stock metaphors (sea-foam vanishing, seeds as beginnings) without fresh specificity. Information density drops in the final third where summary restates theme. These artifacts touch the closure beat, preventing high-band entry and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb and artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—emotions transliterated into glyphs, seeds from a migrating bird whispering memories—offers surface novelty but develops via familiar meditation-and-epiphany structure. The central insight (paths transform rather than vanish) feels generic and could apply to any loss narrative with minor edits. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material; the ending restates theme rather than transforming prior particulars. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the template is recognizable and untransformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marin collects foam, reads glyphs, and conjectures across multiple beats (setup, middle, ending). However, her actions do not create key turns—she observes and reflects without making a decision that narrows options or incurs cost. The character is present and active but her choices do not alter trajectory; swappable with a generic researcher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Crater glass is introduced early, used in multiple beats (transliterates emotions, shows glyphs, casts rainbow patterns at the end). It constrains her method (she must use it to read foam) and appears in the final image. However, it does not evolve in function or meaning—it remains a static tool. Strong beat involvement and closure presence, but low irreplaceability and no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Missing pieces are signaled early ("gaps in the narratives"), shape the middle beat (sailor's glyph contradicts her conjecture), and the ending explicitly resolves the concept ("missing pieces were not lost, but integrated"). The concept drives the dominant stake and reappears at closure. However, it does not constrain tactics on the page—Marin's process does not change when gaps appear. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Transliteration is established early and used across beats (foam→glyphs, emotions→visible echoes). The attribute enables her method but does not constrain action with visible cost—she simply reads what appears. Functional and necessary to the premise, but swappable with any divination mechanism without altering the arc. No trade-off or friction tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conjecture is invoked early, recurs in the middle ("she conjectured that paths disappear…"), and the final insight is framed as the culmination of her conjectures. It shapes the narrative arc as her primary method. However, other methods (crater glass reading, seed whispers) do the heavy lifting; "conjecture" could be replaced with "analysis" or "synthesis" with minimal edit. Beat involvement and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The migrating bird's scattered seeds are introduced early, grow vines with whispering flowers used in the middle, and reappear in the final third ("The migrating bird would return, scattering more seeds"). The method supplements the crater glass by filling gaps the foam missed. However, it does not shape attempts—Marin does not adjust tactics when seeds arrive or fail. Three gates met; causal pressure and cost are low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The iridescent cave inside a crystal geode is anchored early, recurs as atmospheric detail ("cheerful gloom," crystals, light), and appears in the ending image. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—Marin's work would proceed identically in any quiet workspace. The setting is vivid but ornamental. Setup and closure presence earn mid-band; no development constraint caps at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "before memory fades" is invoked early and recurs ("Time was slipping away," "before the last glyphs dissolved," "before memory faded entirely"). However, it does not tighten decisions—the fading glyphs do not force Marin to choose between competing actions or accept a trade-off. The clock is mentioned but not tracked or enforced. Present across beats but does not alter tactics; no cost tied to the deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths disappear is established early via backstory ("she had once followed a path that vanished"), drives the dominant stake throughout, and the ending delivers the answer. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—Marin's process unfolds smoothly without friction between want and cost. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option tied to the pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom is invoked early, recurs across beats ("the cheerful gloom of the cave comforted her," "cheerful gloom embracing her"), and modulates slightly (cave "seemed to brighten" then returns to gloom at the end). The tone is coherent and charges the final image. However, it remains a static label rather than an embodied texture that shifts under pressure. Strong setup, recurrence, and closure presence; moderate specificity and cost linkage.</comment>
