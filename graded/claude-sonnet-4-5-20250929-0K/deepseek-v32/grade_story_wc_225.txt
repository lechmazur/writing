<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior life is established through concrete habits (fidgeting with thread, analyzing like chess endgames) and his guilt is embodied in the "trapped clock spring" metaphor. The arc from burdened to forgiven reads cleanly, but the epiphany "I forgive you" arrives without sufficient on-page struggle or contradiction—he navigates the mental labyrinth and speaks the words in a single beat. The productive fidgeting trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost; it remains decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of symbolic objects (labyrinth, tapestry) and returns to them with shifted meaning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Closure occurs on-page when Elian whispers forgiveness and the village unfreezes, but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no prior choice is visibly foreclosed, and the "woven hush" dissolves without resistance. The Resonant Reconfiguration reads more like a relief than a renunciation with price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (gleaming surfaces, frayed threads, thick stillness). Spatial choreography is clean across square and cottage. The tapestry's border constrains Elian's exploration and charges the final image when the labyrinth dims, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor slip: "distant thunder" recurs but does not alter tactics or choices; it remains atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elian connects the tapestry threads to his own arrogance, then navigates the mental labyrinth—a single deepening rather than escalating pressure. Agency is present (he chooses to engage, decode, forgive), but the resolution unfolds without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. The labyrinth "pulsing" and village "breathing again" read as external validation rather than a cost Elian pays.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than statement: the tapestry's frayed threads mirror regret, the labyrinth maps the mind. The final image of mended tapestry and dimmed labyrinth offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the forgiveness question. Minor slip: "fierce repose" is named twice in narration rather than arising purely from rhythm and image, and the final paragraph edges toward summation ("The past was a tapestry he had mended").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (chess-tutor lens: "analyzing a chess endgame," "each turn represented a decision"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "woven hush" and "fierce repose" recurring purposefully. Minor register drift: "winnow truth from memory" and "productive fidgeting" feel slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but remain within plausible interior lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("coiled inside him like a trapped clock spring"). Paraphrase loop at lines 32–34: "woven hush" named, then immediately re-explained as "the sound of his own paused life." Template cadence in paragraphs describing the labyrinth: repeated "The labyrinth's X" stems. Filter-verb stack: "seemed to correspond," "seemed to pulse." Information density is high in tapestry and labyrinth beats, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the departure. Deductions: −0.4 paraphrase, −0.3 template stems, −0.2 filter cluster = baseline ~7.8, reduced to 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor protagonist, time-frozen memory village, and tapestry-decoding is specific and non-obvious. The labyrinth-as-mind and threads-as-choices are fresh inflections on familiar self-forgiveness arcs. Risk: the symbolic landscape could feel allegorical, but lived detail (fidgeting, frayed edges, cool metal) anchors it. Swappability concern: the chess-tutor background could be replaced with another analytical profession without structural loss; the chess motif does not constrain a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's decision to enter the cottage, trace the tapestry, and navigate the mental labyrinth drives all major turns. His choice to forgive closes the story. Present early, active in middle exploration, and decisive at closure—all three gates met. Cost connection is weak: no visible tradeoff tied to his exile or chess background at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears in paragraph 8, is approached and sensed as key, pulses in sync with tapestry discoveries (middle beat), and is touched at closure when Elian places hands on it and it dims. Setup, development, payoff all present. It enables the mental navigation tactic. Swappability: another symbolic puzzle object could replace it with minor edits; the "platinum" material does not matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is named early and returns at closure when it "trembled and then dissolved." It shapes the atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter Elian's tactics—he decodes threads and navigates the labyrinth regardless. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than a pressure that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is mentioned twice: fingers fidget with thread (helps him think) and later "productive fidgeting became focused exploration." Both are label-only; no on-page cost or constraint tied to the habit. The trait could be cut without altering any turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears three times: winnow truth from memory (early intent), winnow threads (middle tapestry work separating joy/sorrow), and winnow past actions (mental labyrinth). The middle beat is most functional—sorting threads drives discovery. The action is signaled early and used at closure, but swappable with "sort" or "sift." Cost: the sorting itself does not foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is introduced when Elian realizes "the method presented itself" and executed across paragraphs 22–26, pulling loose ends and separating threads. The method enables the key discovery (his arrogance thread). Signaled early enough, used in the middle turn. Late closure linkage is weak—he returns to the labyrinth rather than the tapestry at the end. Swappability: another decoding method (reading symbols, listening) could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Time-frozen village is established in the opening lines, frames all action, and the unfreezing at closure is the story's decisive change. The setting provides the central constraint (nothing moves) and releases it (sound returns, village breathes). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The frozen state shapes Elian's realization that it is his memory given form.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in paragraph 4 and again at paragraph 37 ("During the next lull of thunder"). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elian's actions are contemplative, not time-pressured. The thunder remains a backdrop without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to forgive himself is stated early ("He had come here to forgive himself") and drives every choice: entering the cottage, decoding the tapestry, navigating the labyrinth, whispering "I forgive you." The desire is conflicted (remorse "coiled inside him") and the final act closes the arc. Cost friction: the forgiveness feels more like acceptance than a renunciation with visible loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named twice (paragraphs 15 and 44) and the tone of stillness-under-pressure coheres across beats. The oxymoron charges the final image ("a new silence—one of acceptance"). However, the tone is declared rather than purely embodied in rhythm and image; paragraph 44's explicit naming reduces its resonance. Modulation with pressure is present but modest.</comment>
