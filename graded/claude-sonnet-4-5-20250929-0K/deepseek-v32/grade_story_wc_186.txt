<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and specific (proving coincidences have meaning), rooted in his grandfather's last words. His retrocognitive gift is embodied through concrete sensory detail ("a shard of hush so complete it felt solid") and shapes his actions throughout. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by the accumulated pressure of years of charting stars and the specific alignment moment. Minor weakness: the emotional progression from despair to hope could show more contradictory impulses in the peak beat rather than a relatively smooth arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (custodian, tower, post-collapse world). The story follows a clean causal line: alignment triggers vision, vision reveals star path, path enables rekindling. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the beacon transforms from guide-light to meaning-signal, with the cost legible in "thistle-blown hope take solid form" against "endless night." The lens is causal with accumulative texture; both hold through closure without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass pavilion hums and vibrates under Elias's feet, constraining his physical interaction with the prism. The broken prism's fracture is tactile ("cool face," "hairline seam that glimmered") and becomes the mechanism through which the star path locks. Setting details are filtered through Elias's custodial familiarity (manuals, apparatus housing). The pavilion's hum deepening to chorus charges the final rekindling beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) is signaled early and tightens when the alignment arrives. The tightening is meaningful: Elias must reinterpret the prism's "shard of hush" as frozen instruction, then realign the apparatus following the ghostly trail. The cost is visible in the transformation—he assembles meaning from fragments but the beacon's new form acknowledges lost ships will never return. One clean escalation through protagonist agency under a causal lens with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (meaning from fragments, light from silence) emerges organically from the prism's fracture and Elias's retrocognitive visions without overt statement. The final image—"a defiant signal in the endless night"—reweights the entire premise: the beacon no longer guides but proves. "Thistle-blown hope" recurs with changed weight at closure. The story resists tidy morals; the new beacon is "different," quieter, acknowledging what's lost while asserting presence. The conceptual cost (no ships will come) charges the resolution without diluting thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("thistle-blown hope," "retrocognitively blessed") and matches the archival, custodial register. Elias's perceptual signature filters through his role: he notices star paths, manuals, mechanisms. Slight register drift in "consuming silence" and "profound and utter silence" (near-synonyms in quick succession) but not enough to break coherence. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean and internal thought formatting consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("silent ruins and overgrown metal," "luminous trail arcing"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "shard of hush so complete it felt solid" and "consuming silence" restate similar content within three paragraphs. "Thistle-blown hope" appears twice but the second use reweights it, so acceptable. Rhythm varies appropriately. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The closure image ("defiant signal in the endless night") is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of retrocognition, broken prism as frozen-time lock, and star-path mechanics feels fresh and organically integrated rather than checklist-assembled. The transformation of "coincidence" into "deliberate pattern" through a fractured (not healed) prism is a non-obvious synthesis. The post-collapse custodian premise is familiar but transformed through the specific technology (prism splits light) and the grandfather's constellation clue. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative ending (no dramatic confrontation, ships never return) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias drives every key turn: he charts stars for years, interprets the prism vision, fits the prism at the perfect alignment, reinterprets the fracture as lock, realigns the apparatus, and completes the rekindling. His choices create all beats and the closure unit. Early setup (paragraph 1), middle development (vision and reinterpretation), and closure participation (final alignment and beam) all present. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability high. Cost is tied to his years of effort and the transformation of his hope.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism appears in setup (paragraph 2: "broken crystal prism, fractured along a hairline seam"), drives the middle beat (vision of "shard of hush," reinterpretation as frozen instruction), and is the mechanism of closure (conducts light through fracture). Handled physically: Elias runs fingers over it, fits it into housing, looks through it, realigns it. The fracture's dual nature (break and lock) is specific and irreplaceable. Three distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage both strong. Removing it collapses the entire plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is introduced in paragraph 2 as the vision Elias receives from the prism. It constrains his understanding (he jerks back, confused) and enables the middle turn when he reinterprets it as "preserved time" and "frozen instruction." The concept shapes tactics: he must follow the ghostly star path through the fracture. Present in closure as the realization that silence was the key, not an obstacle. Causal pressure and specificity both strong. Removing this exact formulation would require significant rewrites to the prism's function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Retrocognition is established in paragraph 1 ("echoes of the past imprinted on objects") and enables two key beats: the prism vision (paragraph 2) and the star-path vision (paragraph 4). The trait constrains Elias—he sees the "shard of hush" instead of useful past images, creating friction. Cost is visible: "more curse than gift, a constant reminder of all that was lost." The ability is essential to interpreting the prism and completing the rekindling. Two beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Rekindle" frames the entire narrative goal from paragraph 2 onward. Every beat traces to this action: charting stars, interpreting the prism, aligning the apparatus, and the final rekindling. The action is dramatized on the page in paragraph 5 ("With a final, gentle turn, the star path locked into place. The broken prism flared"). Removing or swapping this action collapses the plot. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability high. The transformation (guide-light to meaning-signal) deepens the action's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tracking star paths" is signaled in paragraph 3 ("required aligning the prism with specific constellations on specific nights") and shapes Elias's years of preparation. The mechanics matter: he charts stars, matches them to diagrams, waits for the alignment. In paragraph 4, the star path becomes literal ("luminous trail arcing from the star, through the prism's fracture"). The method drives the final beat: "He realigned the entire apparatus, following the ghostly trail." Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Removing this method requires a different plot engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is introduced in paragraph 1 as the tower's foundation and recurs in paragraphs 4–5 as an active element: it hums when the prism is fitted, vibrates "in his bones," and the star path descends "into the core of the pavilion." The hum deepening to chorus is part of the rekindling sequence. The pavilion supplies the energy reservoir that enables the beacon's transformation. Setup, development, and closure participation present. Causal pressure moderate to strong; removing the pavilion would require rewriting the power source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The collapse is established in paragraph 1 ("after the collapse," "silent ruins and overgrown metal") and frames the world state: no sky-faring ships, only relics. It motivates Elias's isolation and his need to prove meaning. The timeframe shapes his years of preparation and the final choice: the new beacon acknowledges ships "would never come" yet signals anyway. Present in setup and closure; causal pressure moderate. The collapse could be replaced with another civilization-ending event without major rewrites, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This motivation is introduced in paragraph 1 ("he needed to prove that coincidences have meaning") and drives every choice: years of star-charting, waiting for alignment, interpreting the prism vision. Paragraph 4 explicitly dramatizes the friction: "It was the coincidence he had been waiting for." The final paragraph completes the arc: "He was stitching a coincidence... into a deliberate pattern." The motivation is conflicted (grandfather's words "had to be more than a dying man's ramble") and costly (years of seemingly futile effort). Setup, development, closure participation, and cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" is introduced in paragraph 3 as Elias's emotional state ("Hope felt thin and scattered, like thistle-blown hope, carried on a bitter wind") and recurs transformed in the final line: "Elias watched his thistle-blown hope take solid form, a defiant signal in the endless night." The tone modulates with pressure: despair in paragraph 3, cautious wonder in paragraph 4, quiet defiance at closure. Coherent through turns and charged in the final image. Early–final reprise with clear reweighting. Removing this exact phrase would not break plot logic, but it anchors the emotional arc and charges closure.</comment>
