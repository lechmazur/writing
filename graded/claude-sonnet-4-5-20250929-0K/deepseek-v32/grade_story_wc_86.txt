<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris is embodied through the warm drawer pull and her philosophical bent, and her motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is clear. However, the internal conflict feels muted—her thoughtful proposal flows smoothly without competing impulses acting simultaneously in the beat. The captain's single nod forecloses hostility, but the cost registers more as conceptual than visceral; we lack a micro-choice that reveals what Aris sacrificed or risked in this gesture beyond professional protocol.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through repeated mist imagery, the antique pull's handling, and moon-phase synchronization, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the captain says "I will consider the mechanism." Cost is legible—Aris plants a seed without certainty of return—and the closure reweights the opening "furrowed hush" from desolate to contemplative. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words). One tightening occurs when the captain pauses at the stone, crystallizing options without full resolution, which fits this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet, mist, and wind are vivid and recurring, and the brass drawer pull functions as micro-setting that constrains Aris's gesture—she places it "on the damp stone between them," a spatial decision that charges the final image when it remains there. Sensory selection (mist beading on the captain's brow, wind scouring stone) reflects urgency and filters through Aris's professional focus. However, spatial choreography of the prisoner midpoint exchange is sketched rather than precise, and the occupational detail (negotiator protocols) remains generic at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing another crossfire—is signaled early and tightens when Aris proposes the lunar-cycle observation exchange, a choice that narrows options from silent hatred to tentative thread. The captain's pause and conditional acceptance ("I will consider") constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is visible: Aris leaves the pull on the stone, a renunciation that may go unreciprocated. Agency is clear (her decision to introduce the gesture), though the prisoners themselves remain passive instruments rather than sources of friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the drawer pull (mechanisms for opening), moon synchronization (forces larger than war), and the temporal frame (between apology and forgiveness). The final image—pull left on the stone, "contemplative, not desolate" hush—reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the carpenter's wisdom and "recycling mistakes" are articulated rather than purely shown, and the lunar-observation proposal edges toward thematic thesis ("threads could weave a net to catch falling trust") rather than letting the image speak. The resonance is present but slightly over-explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited, and Aris's perceptual signature (philosophical framing, tactile focus on the pull's warmth) is distinct. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the captain's "I will consider the mechanism" carries subtext and advances plot. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose reflects Aris's thoughtful register without jarring shifts. The captain's dialogue is slightly generic ("Before we proceed, I have something for you" could be sharper), but no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks interrupt the flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance atmosphere or stake. "A silence etched with the memory of gales" and "a ghost in the mist" are vivid, though "furrowed hush" in the opener and "contemplative, not desolate" near the end edge toward poetic declaration rather than image. Minor scaffold appears: "her thoughts turning like the fog below" is slightly generic, and "the ritual was familiar, yet her heart thrummed" uses a common template. No paraphrase loops or heavy artifacts touch the closure beat, but density dips slightly in the middle exposition ("The agreed method for the exchange was synchronizing through moon phases…").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of antique drawer pull, moon-phase synchronization, and neutral-territory ritual feels specific and interwoven rather than checklist. The proposal of lunar non-military observations is a fresh inflection on prisoner-exchange tropes, and the carpenter's wisdom anchors universals in a concrete object. However, the "between apology and forgiveness" frame and the mist-shrouded parapet carry some genre familiarity, and the philosophical voice risks abstract elevation in places ("mechanisms for opening and closing," "we compartmentalize our lives"). The piece synthesizes its elements well but does not take bold structural risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout, makes the key decision to offer the pull and propose the observation exchange, and her choice alters the captain's stance ("I will consider"). Early signal, middle beat (placement of pull), closure linkage (her remaining on the parapet as others leave), and causal pressure are all present. The cost—leaving the pull, planting a seed without guarantee—ties directly to her role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique drawer pull appears in three beats: Aris finds it in her pocket (early), places it on the stone with explanation (middle), and it remains there at closure, reweighting the gesture. Its brass warmth and generational history charge it with specificity, and its mechanics metaphor shapes the conversation. Removing it would break the story's logic and symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Neutral territory is named, defines the parapet's function (enemies meet without violence), and enables the exchange. It shapes the opening setup and constrains the ritual, but does not alter tactics mid-scene or introduce friction—it is a stable condition rather than a complicating pressure. Present in all three gates (setup, middle function, closure setting) but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is asserted ("She was uncommonly thoughtful for a person in her line of work") and demonstrated through her philosophical reflection on hinges and handles. It enables her lunar-observation proposal, a choice others might not make. However, the trait is stated rather than discovered through a visible tradeoff, and no on-page cost (hesitation, misunderstanding by the captain) dramatizes the risk of being too thoughtful in a tense negotiation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Untether" is signaled early ("she intended to untether the process from its historical bitterness"), defines her action (releasing old protocol, introducing the gesture), and the captain's response hinges on it. The term is specific and irreplaceable—"break" or "change" would lack the nautical-anchor connotation. It appears in setup, drives the middle proposal, and the closure reweights it ("a subtle unknotting within"). Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Synchronizing through moon phases is named, explained ("The full moon had crested last night, meaning the window for the trade was this single, fog-shrouded hour"), and Aris invokes it in her speech ("We synchronize by the moon, a force that pulls tides and men alike"). It shapes the timing constraint and supports her lunar-observation proposal, but the mechanics do not alter tactics or create friction—it is a fixed rule rather than a complication. Setup and middle presence; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The storm-worn windblown parapet in mist is vivid, anchors the opening, and the damp stone becomes the site where Aris places the pull—a micro-setting decision that charges the final image. The mist and wind recur, modulating tone. However, the parapet does not constrain movement or supply a tactical resource beyond its symbolic neutrality; it functions more as atmosphere than pressure. Setup, middle anchoring, closure setting; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "between apology and forgiveness" is named in the opening ("she existed in the tense space between that apology and its potential absolution") and echoed at closure ("Between apology and forgiveness, she had planted a seed"). It frames the emotional arc, but does not tighten decisions or impose a ticking clock—the full-moon hour is the live constraint, not the apology-forgiveness span. Present in setup and closure; lyric resonance without middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To recycle mistakes into wisdom" is Aris's stated motivation, dramatized through her lunar-observation proposal (turning haste into patience). It drives her key choice and is tied to cost (planting a seed without certainty). However, the phrasing is abstract and close to theme-label; the motivation is told ("Her motivation was clear to her alone: to recycle mistakes into wisdom") rather than discovered through a conflicted micro-choice. Setup, middle enabling, closure restatement; moderate friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" opens the piece ("a silence etched with the memory of gales"), recurs ("The furrowed hush remained"), and modulates at closure ("it now felt contemplative, not desolate"). Tone is coherent through turns—quiet, weighted, philosophical—and the final shift charges the ending image. The phrase is specific and voice-driven, though slightly precious. Setup, middle atmosphere, closure reweighting; strong integration.</comment>
