<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her final shift from academic escape to active witness is earned through the telegram discovery. The internal contradiction between scholarly pursuit and emotional avoidance drives the arc. However, the closure moment leans heavily on summary ("She was sharing the burden now, with the page, with the memory") rather than showing the specific embodied cost of this shift. The sister Cora remains a narrative device rather than a felt presence whose loss compounds on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural moving toward Resonant Reconfiguration. The telegram discovery triggers reinterpretation of both stellar work and sister's death, landing in a journal-writing closure that attempts charged poise. Orientation is clean. The core weakness: the climactic realization ("solitude" vs "witnessed") arrives through linguistic reversal rather than pressure-tested choice, and the final writing scene tells the healing effect rather than dramatizing a concrete foreclosed path or visible cost in the present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory dome provides consistent spatial anchoring and the "soft green glow of her desk lamp" charges the translation moment. The pressed daylily-telegram functions as micro-setting, bridging past and present materially. The variable stars constrain her interpretive method throughout. Setting details reflect professional priority (stellar charts, telescope, logbook) without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions while processing unresolved grief—is signaled early and tightens when the telegram reframes both quests. One meaningful deepening occurs: the glyph reinterpretation that shifts "solitude" to "witnessed." However, escalation relies on intellectual reversal rather than a choice that narrows live options, and the writing-as-healing resolution doesn't foreclose a prior path with on-page cost—it opens a new one summarized rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shared-burdens theme emerges organically from the variable stars metaphor ("They pulsed in cycles of brilliance and darkness, a celestial acknowledgment that light is temporary and must be held by others when it fades") and the linguistic discovery. The daylily-telegram as material bridge between silence and language works well. The final image of the telegram beside the new chronicle offers resonance. Minor slip: "translate silence into language" and "map for human connection" veer toward stated thesis in the penultimate paragraph rather than remaining fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature favors celestial and linguistic particulars ("erratic stellar patterns," "rhythmic brightening and dimming"). Diction remains controlled and character-apt. The shift from scientist to sister in the writing moment is signaled and earned. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she finally grasped") cluster slightly in the reflection-heavy final third but remain voice-motivated and don't obscure pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the translation and telegram beats. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop: "shared burden" and cognates appear five times in the final quarter, creating thematic echo that borders on redundancy. The phrase "the burden was never meant to be carried in silence" followed two beats later by "sharing the burden now" and "The shared burden felt lighter" constitutes paraphrase churn that dulls the closure's specificity. No other artifacts touch the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial cartography, linguistic decipherment, and grief processing through variable-star metaphor is specific and non-obvious. The pressed-flower telegram as time-bridge artifact feels fresh. The transformation test passes: swapping names/places would collapse the observational frame. However, the "academic realizes emotional truth through professional work" template is widely used, and the piece does not fully escape it—the moral calculus remains fairly predictable once the glyph-shift is revealed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames expectation early, drives the glyph reinterpretation in mid-story, and makes the writing choice at closure. However, her chronicler role remains observational until the final beat; the lucid-dream aspect is never dramatized or constrained on the page—it's label-only. The decision to write the new chronicle is present but summarized rather than shown as a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in beat one (parcel arrival), is handled and read in beat two (yellow bloom, petal-stained words, Cora's message), and returns in the final image beside the new chronicle as a material bridge. Its pressed-flower state charges both past silence and present witness. The object constrains Elara's reinterpretation and shapes the closure image with visible continuity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shared burdens shapes the glyph reinterpretation ("solitude" vs "witnessed," "void" vs "shared") and the variable-star metaphor explicitly articulates it ("no one should glow or dim alone"). It alters Elara's understanding and motivates the journal-writing closure. However, the concept remains thematic—asserted in translation and metaphor—rather than tested through a tactical on-page choice with competing costs. It echoes more than it constrains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "heals with words" attribute is named late ("Elara possessed the rare attribute: she heals with words") and the journal-writing beat describes the sutured wound ("began to suture an old, internal wound"). However, this healing is told summary rather than dramatized with visible cost or trade-off in the present action. The attribute enables the closure gesture but does not constrain an earlier choice or force a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Witness" as action threads through the narrative: Elara witnesses variable stars, realizes the temple teaching is about witnessed burdens, and the final act is "retroactive witnessing" via writing. The word "witnessed" anchors the key glyph shift. The action shapes two beats (glyph discovery, journal writing) and charges the closure. However, witnessing remains largely internal and reflective; a physical dramatization of the act with tactical friction would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early as the decipherment method ("through variable stars, whose rhythmic brightening and dimming she believed held the syntax"), anchor the celestial metaphor at midpoint ("They pulsed in cycles of brilliance and darkness"), and frame the temple teaching. The method matters conceptually but is not tactically tested—Elara does not adjust her use of the stars under pressure or face a choice between competing stellar readings.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory provides spatial continuity, supplies the telescope and desk lamp that anchor key beats, and frames the midnight-solace tone. The dome's "cavernous" quality and "soft green glow" charge atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elara could perform the same realization in any quiet study. It functions as backdrop and mood rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" as timeframe is thematic (the final paragraph: "when understanding dawns, both in the sky and in the soul") and the grey dawn light marks closure. However, time remains atmospheric rather than tactical—no live clock tightens Elara's decisions. The timeframe mirrors the theme but does not pressure the action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Decoding temple inscriptions is stated as "official motivation" in paragraph one, drives the glyph-work in mid-story, and the reinterpretation ("solitude" to "witnessed") is the key turn. The motivation is dramatized through translation and ties to closure. However, friction between the official quest and the private grief quest is asserted more than tested—Elara does not face a choice that forces her to sacrifice one for the other.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Midnight solace is established early ("cavernous dome offered midnight solace, a silent space"), sustained through nocturnal work ("hushed observatory," "soft green glow," "long night"), and modulates at closure when "soft, grey light crept through the slit of the dome" and "In the quiet of the approaching morning, Elara finally found the solace she had been searching for." Tone coheres and charges the final image without static repetition.</comment>
