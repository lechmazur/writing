<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation—unearthing wisdom in his misfiling error—is clear and drives his final act. The interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("enlarged tranquility," "symbiotic script") that keeps emotional texture at arm's length rather than embodying contradiction under pressure. The choice to hide the index in plain sight is signaled but feels more thematic declaration than a micro-choice with visible internal friction. Empathy is labeled frequently but rarely shown constraining a competing impulse on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: Aris, the Athenaeum, tonight, pre-midnight. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through nested metaphor and symbolic arrangement rather than because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aris steps out, accepting the paradox, the library waiting to be found. Cost is conceptual—he forecloses his reclusion—but the final image ("enlarged tranquility… paradox resolved") tells the shift more than it dramatizes a felt price, weakening the charge. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; pattern is taught early and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's vaulted reading room, shadow-draped stacks, and ordinary bookshop facade anchor place vividly. The treatise and vellum index function as micro-setting objects that constrain Aris's final act: he reshelves the index within the compassionate-symbiosis pages, a spatial choice that charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris's calm focus ("city air cool on his face"). The gate for 9+ is met—object constrains choice and charges ending—but some description tilts ornamental ("silence… potential") rather than pressuring tactics, holding the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rectify the misfiling error and answer the conclave invitation, signaled early. The tightening occurs when Aris hides the index in the treatise, a single meaningful deepening that reweights protection as exposure. Under the Accumulative lens, one turn is sufficient at this length. Agency is present—Aris chooses to leave—but the cost (ceasing to hide) is more conceptual assertion than a visible trade-off that forecloses a competing live option on the page. No clear secondary pressure tests his commitment; the move feels preordained rather than forced by friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The nested-paradox theme (hide by exposing, stay by leaving, error as seed) emerges organically from Aris's choices and the library's nature. The final image—walking toward the conclave, invitation as map, library waiting—offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece states the paradox too explicitly in multiple beats ("to protect by exposing, to guard by gifting"; "paradox resolved"), reducing subtext. The botanical-treatise motif ties premise to ending but the conceptual resonance is asserted more than it lands through image alone, capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable and clean. Voice carries a distinct meditative register ("enlarged tranquility," "fertile soil of a past fault") that matches Aris's archival world. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The diction, however, drifts into elevated abstraction under peak beats ("nested paradoxes… resilient seed… guiding star") where a tighter perceptual signature would sharpen pressure. Free indirect style is consistent. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear moderately but remain voice-motivated. Purposeful compression is present; the lyric cadence is taught early and holds through closure without obscuring the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the meditative tone. Information density is moderate: many sentences perform thematic work but some loop conceptually (e.g., "enlarged tranquility" recurs without added pressure; "nested paradoxes" is restated across beats). Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "All was calm, all was clear" and several "no longer… now…" constructions that echo prior phrasing. Mixed metaphor: "wisdom… a flawless gem… a resilient seed" shifts vehicle mid-image. Stock phrases ("silent potential," "turning page") reduce specificity. Paraphrase loops are present but brief; apply baseline artifact deduction (−0.6) in Q7 only. Clarity remains intact; the artifacts dull momentum without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The recluse-attends-conclave frame and library-of-errors premise offer a fresh angle on compassion and paradox. The nested structure (hiding by revealing, staying by leaving) is conceptually coherent and specific to this setting. However, the emotional arc—recluse finds courage through past mistake—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (walk out, attend meeting) is telegraphed early without a non-obvious turn. The botanical treatise and symbiotic-root detail add texture, but the final beats rely on stated paradox rather than a surprising synthesis earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its meditative mode but does not venture into bold structural or perspectival choices that heighten stakes beyond the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris, the compassionate recluse, is established in the opening and his choices (hide the index, leave for the conclave) create the story's key turns. Observation and reflection dominate much of the piece, but the decision to hide the index in plain sight and step out alters tactics and forecloses his reclusive stance. The character is essential across setup, middle, and ending, with visible cost (leaving sanctuary). Specificity is solid: his empathy drives the error's rectification. Deduct slightly for reliance on label ("compassionate") over embodied friction, but causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in the opening ("now smoothed on his desk"), is picked up mid-story ("He picked up the smoothed invitation"), and returns in the ending ("the crumpled invitation now a map in his hand"). It frames expectation, enables the final choice (he will go), and is reweighted in the closing image as "a map… its message finally understood." Three distinct beats; strong lyric reprise; causal role in the ending. Irreplaceability is moderate—another call to action could substitute with edits—but the physical handling and symbolic charge across beats justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nested paradoxes are named in the conclave theme and enacted throughout: hide by exposing, stay by leaving, error as fertile ground. The concept shapes stakes (rectify the misfiling, protect the library) and the ending image ("paradox resolved"). It appears early, constrains Aris's method (hide the index in plain sight), and is visibly reweighted at closure. However, the piece states the paradox more than it dramatizes its tactical cost; the nesting is thematic assertion rather than a mechanics that alters live options under pressure. Strong setup and payoff; moderate development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's "keenly empathetic" sense is mentioned in the opening ("detected the loneliness in old texts") and drives his motivation ("his empathy… now drove him to rectify"). It appears in the ending ("his empathy now his compass"). Setup and closure participation are present, but the trait is labeled more than it constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. The middle beat where empathy might force a trade-off (e.g., between protecting the library and exposing it) is narrated as resolved rather than dramatized as friction. Swappable with "guilt" or "regret" with minor edits; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "hide" is central: Aris hides the library's index (the core secret) by placing it in the treatise, a reversal of traditional hiding. This act drives the middle turn and defines the closure logic (protection through exposure). The hiding is dramatized on the page ("slipped the delicate index… between the pages") and is causally tied to the ending (library "readiness to be found"). Early signal, strong beat involvement, irreplaceability high—removing "hide" breaks the nested-paradox structure. Cost is conceptual but legible. Very strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method "staying while leaving" is named explicitly and frames Aris's final act: he departs physically but leaves the library's heart in place. It appears in the opening reflection, is enacted when he hides the index and walks out, and charges the ending image ("a compassionate man no longer reclusive"). Setup, development, and payoff are present. However, the mechanics are asserted more than they constrain tactics—Aris's choice feels thematically neat rather than forced by competing pressures. The method is integral to the concept but somewhat ornamental in execution; lyric reprise lifts it into low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Athenaeum, hidden behind a common bookshop, is established early and its dual nature (secret/visible) mirrors the nested-paradox theme. The setting supplies the central resource (the treatise, the index) and the ending stakes (library waiting to be found). Spatial detail is vivid ("vaulted, shadow-draped reading room") and the reshelving action uses the stacks concretely. The setting constrains Aris's method (he must hide within the library's own logic) and charges the final image. Strong setup and closure linkage; irreplaceability moderate (another hidden archive could substitute). Solid integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Midnight is mentioned in the opening ("within arm's reach of midnight"), recurs at the middle ("minute hand crept within arm's reach"), and the ending ("distant clock began to strike twelve… midnight bell finished its toll"). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure and a symbolic boundary (day/night, old life/new). However, it does not visibly tighten decisions or alter tactics—Aris completes his task without rush, and the clock functions as backdrop rather than forcing a choice. Setup and payoff are clear; causal pressure is weak. Mid-5s for lyric reprise without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's desire to "unearth wisdom in a mistake" is stated early, drives the entire arc (rectify the misfiling, attend the conclave), and is resolved in the ending ("unearthed wisdom in his mistake"). The motivation is dramatized through his choice to hide the index and leave, and the cost (end his reclusion) is tied to this desire. Friction between the want (understand the error) and the cost (expose himself) is present but lightly sketched. Strong setup, clear beat involvement, and closure linkage. Irreplaceability solid: the motivation is specific to the botanical-treatise error. Mid-7s for good integration with modest on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "enlarged tranquility" is established in the opening ("moved with an enlarged tranquility") and recurs in the ending ("within the enlarged tranquility of a paradox resolved"). It remains coherent and calm across turns, supporting the meditative lens. However, the tone is static—no modulation under pressure—and is stated more than it charges the final image through rhythm or diction shift. The phrase itself is abstract and repeated without evolving meaning. Setup and payoff are clear; beat involvement is ornamental. Lyric reprise without tactical charge: low-6s.</comment>
