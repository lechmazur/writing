<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is abstract ("harmonize logic and intuition") and her interior leans heavily on label-speak ("quiet obsession," "meticulous formulas, yet secretly sentimental"). The final action—touching flame to crystal—feels performed rather than chosen under pressure; no visible foreclosing of an alternate path or cost. The single petal detail is charming but remains ornamental, not a driver of choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (waterfall, starlings, crystal, flame, blossoms) toward a final transformation. Closure arrives on the page (tree buds unfurl), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse; the piece declares harmony "achieved" without dramatizing what was risked or forfeited. Orientation is clear early (orchard, waterfall, alchemist). One meaningful deepening when flame turns white, but the transformation itself feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard and waterfall are vivid, anchored early, and the prismatic light functionally channels through the crystal. Spatial choreography is clear (barefoot in moss, hollowed stone behind water). The flock of starlings and the silver-barked tree constrain the alchemist's method and charge the final image, lifting this into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake (achieve the touch of wonder) is signaled early. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens, but no live option is foreclosed; the text moves from preparation to success without a reversal or visible cost. Agency is present (she performs flame, pours feeling into it), yet the transformation feels inevitable rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—logic and intuition unified—emerges through concrete images (frozen crystal, orange-then-white flame, starling patterns). The final image (luminous blossoms) resonates without moralizing. Minor penalty: the mentor's dictum ("touch of wonder is the ignition point") and the closing declaration ("harmonized at last") lean toward thematic echo rather than letting the image carry all weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single stable POV; diction is elevated and consistent ("kaleidoscopic," "incandescent," "amorphous cloud"). No head-hopping. Minor register drift: phrases like "a captured breath of the world" and "the ache of beauty" occasionally tip into lyric abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance holds; perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are mostly strong; sentences advance image and action. Two issues: paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 ("not just ice; it was a captured breath of the world, a perfect lattice of water and cold" restates the same marvel twice) and template cadence in paragraph 5 ("She closed… seeking not… but the feeling… In her mind…"). No severe artifacts at closure, so penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The alchemist-transforming-nature frame is familiar; the piece does not transform the template beyond vivid imagery. The starling-pattern method is fresh, but it remains observational rather than shaping a choice with cost. The frozen-dew-plus-flame mechanics are specific yet feel ornamental rather than risky or inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Auburn-haired alchemist is present throughout (setup, middle action, closure). Her choices—conjuring flame, pouring sentiment into it, touching crystal—drive two beats and the ending transformation. Cost is conceptual (achieving harmony) rather than a visible trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Frozen dew crystal appears in setup (paragraph 2), is held and studied mid-scene (paragraph 3), interacts with flame and rainbow light (paragraph 5–6), and dissolves to transform the tree (paragraph 7). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (it must not melt; it glows), and closure linkage. Specificity is high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Touch of wonder is named early (paragraph 2: mentor's words) and again at closure ("The touch of wonder was achieved"). It frames the quest but does not constrain tactics or shape a mid-scene choice; the piece asserts its achievement rather than dramatizing a cost or trade-off. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Secretly sentimental is labeled in paragraph 2 (pressing petals) and surfaces at the climax when she "allowed her secret sentiment to surface" and pours feeling into the flame. One beat with causal consequence (flame turns white). Cost is implied but not dramatized. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Flame is conjured (paragraph 5), radiates toward crystal (paragraph 5), transforms from orange to white when infused with sentiment (paragraph 6), and is touched to the crystal to complete the transformation (paragraph 7). Three beats, drives closure, irreplaceable (no other action completes the formula). Visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Patterns in a flock of starlings is signaled early (paragraph 3: "understanding the method through the patterns"), informs her mental mapping (paragraph 4: "the crystalline structure… began to map onto the ever-shifting shapes"), and her final intuitive turn (paragraph 6: "Thinking of the starlings' perfect, intuitive turn"). Two beats, shapes tactics. Cost is conceptual; method is lyric rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Hidden orchard behind kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored in the opening sentence, provides the laboratory backdrop, and the waterfall's rainbow light functionally channels through the crystal at closure (paragraph 6). Two beats, closure linkage, and the prism effect is specific. Micro-setting that alters the transformation's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Before the final transformation is stated in the opening (paragraph 1: "the moment stretched taut before the final transformation") and again mid-scene (paragraph 6: "Before the final transformation, she had to merge them"). It frames anticipation but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no countdown or visible pressure from the clock. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To harmonize logic and intuition is stated early (paragraph 2), drives her study of the starlings (paragraph 3–4), and is enacted at closure when logic and intuition merge (paragraph 7: "Logic had crafted the vessel; intuition had provided the spark"). Two beats, shapes tactics, and charges the ending. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ancient freshness appears in the opening line ("state of ancient freshness") and closing line ("the ancient freshness of the world settling in her heart"). Lyric reprise that brackets the piece, but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the middle beats. Present and purposeful; not indispensable.</comment>
