<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (defeating emotional numbness) is grounded and her journey to the cavern embodies agency, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("numb from years of solitary grief," "frozen spirit") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The tears at the end feel earned by prior causality, but the emotional progression from numbness to thaw follows a relatively smooth arc without the messy simultaneity of competing desires. Corin is functional but largely serves as facilitator; no secondary pressure complicates Elara's path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The piece unfolds as a single continuous scene with clear causal linkage: Elara seeks remedy → carries broken needle → Corin repairs and demonstrates backward phonograph → vibration reveals filament of hush → emotional thaw. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (emotional numbness cracks, tears mark recognition) with felt cost (years of solitary grief acknowledged). The accumulative texture (layered metaphor of silence, backward song, mirrored hush) supports the ending image, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than pure scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early with vivid detail ("mirrored hush," "damp stone," "lantern light") and the phonograph functions as a tool that constrains the method of listening. Sensory selection favors vibration over sound, appropriate to Elara's deafness, and the "rustle of turning seasons" reprises at entrance and exit. The drum maker's workspace is lived-in (workbench littered with tools, wax cylinder loaded). However, spatial choreography within the cavern remains general; we lack precise blocking of Elara's movement or tool placement that would raise the specificity further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (defeat emotional numbness) is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates textural density (vibration → filament of hush → tears) rather than a dramatic reversal, fitting the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. The backward recorded song functions as a single meaningful tightening that narrows options (she must feel the silence, not hear it), and the tears mark a visceral reweighting of her emotional state. However, no secondary complication or obstacle tests her commitment; the phonograph delivers exactly what she sought without friction or missed attempt, limiting the pressure arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (silence as healing, absence as presence) emerges from concrete particulars: the broken needle, backward song, filament of hush threading through vibration. The final image of tears as "recognition, as if she had finally heard a long-lost whisper" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the mirrored hush, the inverted rhythms, and the paradox of a deaf music teacher seeking remedy in silence's absence. The last two sentences ("The world remained audibly muted, but within her, a filament of hush now thrived, a silent song that would never break") edge toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than letting the image stand alone, and "silent song that would never break" reads slightly sermonic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elara's perceptual signature foregrounds vibration and touch ("fingertips reading the vibrations," "topography of tremors"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax (phonograph scene), and diction remains within her plausible lexicon. No dialogue on the page; communication happens through sign and gesture, fitting the premise. A few lines lean into elevated register ("enthrall not an audience, but her own frozen spirit," "exquisite absence") that feel authorial rather than character-particular, especially under emotional pressure where compression would be expected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines carry double duty (e.g., "the mirrored hush doubling back on itself in the stone walls" integrates setting and theme). However, patterned artifacts cluster: "audibly muted" appears three times, "filament of hush" five times, "mirrored hush" three times, creating synonym loops and template cadence. Stock metaphors recur ("canvas of vibrations without color," "falling upward into peace"). Filter verbs stack in mid-section ("she perceived it," "she realized"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure ("The world remained audibly muted, but within her, a filament of hush now thrived"), diluting the propulsion at the story's most critical moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, silence as substance, and backward-played music offers a specific angle, and the phonograph needle as inherited relic adds personal texture. The drum maker as enabler rather than antagonist is a fresh choice for this length. However, the emotional arc (numb → remedy sought → thaw via unconventional method → tears of recognition) follows a familiar template, and the backward song device, while concrete, is introduced late and works on first attempt without complication. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the arc in hindsight; swapping "backward phonograph" for another synesthetic tool would leave the structure largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, drives the journey to the cavern, requests the repair, and chooses to engage the phonograph. Her decision to place hands on the horn triggers the climactic vibration, and her tears mark the final turn. The deafness trait constrains her method of listening (touch over hearing), raising irreplaceability. However, the story's pressure comes primarily from the object (needle) and method (backward song); Elara's agency is present but reactive rather than forcing key reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears early (carried to the cavern), is examined and repaired by Corin at mid-story, then fused with silver filament and used in the climactic phonograph scene. Its fracture is described ("tip snapped clean," "fracture a stark line against the wood") and its wholeness at the end ("the broken needle now whole, its purpose fulfilled") reweights the opening loss. The needle's repair enables the backward song, driving causal pressure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; slight swappability (another broken relic could serve similar symbolic function) prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" is Elara's explicit goal from the opening ("she believed, was the key to unlocking a filament of hush"), shapes the phonograph method (Corin seeks to reveal "the silence within" melodies), and is perceived during the climax ("a filament of hush, a pure line of stillness threading through the noise"). It reappears in the final paragraph, now internalized. The concept constrains tactics (she must feel vibration, not sound) and charges the ending image. High irreplaceability and causal pressure; the five recurrences create slight over-reliance on the label rather than varied embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" appears three times as description but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait frames Elara's world ("audibly muted place," "audibly muted to any ear," "world remained audibly muted") and motivates her focus on vibration, but it functions as atmospheric label rather than tactical lever. The deafness itself (Q9 A) does the causal work; "audibly muted" as phrase is replaceable with "silent" or "soundless" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once in early exposition ("to enthrall not an audience, but her own frozen spirit") and once at climax ("She was enthralled, not by sound, but by its exquisite absence"). The word frames her goal but does not drive a distinct beat or shape tactics; it could be swapped for "captivate," "absorb," or "transform" with minor edits. The actual action is placing hands on the phonograph and feeling vibration; "enthrall" is thematic gloss rather than irreplaceable verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled at mid-story (Corin explains the modified phonograph plays them), demonstrated in the climactic beat (wax cylinder loaded, machine spins, "backward recorded song emitted a low, groaning hum"), and shape the method of unlocking silence. The reversal mechanic ("unravel melodies into their component breaths") enables the filament of hush to be perceived. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; introduced past the first third, limiting setup credit. High irreplaceability: the backward method is specific and could not be swapped for generic "music" without breaking the logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is established early ("deep within a hillside," "mirrored hush," "damp stone"), houses the tools and modified phonograph, and its acoustic properties (echoes reflecting back) support the "mirrored hush" tone. The setting enables the method (Corin's workspace) and the cavern "hold[s] its breath" at climax. However, it does not constrain a choice (Elara could use the phonograph anywhere) or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is atmospheric container rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (the workbench, the phonograph horn) does more causal work than the cavern itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Turning seasons" and "autumn's last leaves whispered to the coming frost" appear in the opening and reprise at the exit ("turning season," "rustle of leaves"). Time is poetic frame rather than tactical constraint; no on-page clock tightens decisions. The faint rustle adds texture but does not alter Elara's choices or shape the phonograph's operation. Swappable with any seasonal transition without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Elara's explicit, dramatized goal from the opening ("to defeat the emotional numbness that encased her"), drives her journey to Corin, and is tested in the phonograph scene where "the emotional numbness cracked" and tears follow. The motivation is conflicted (seeking remedy "not in noise, but in its absence") and the cost is felt (years of solitary grief acknowledged). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The phrasing "emotional numbness" recurs four times, creating label-reliance rather than varied embodiment of the state, preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears four times: cavern's air holds it, Corin and Elara share it at the end, and it structures the acoustic environment. The tone is coherent (quiet, reflective, vibration-focused) and modulates subtly under pressure (the "groaning hum" of the backward song, then return to "natural silence, now filled with a new, tender resonance"). The final image charges the tone with the filament now internalized. However, "mirrored hush" itself is metaphorical descriptor rather than enacted pressure; it adds thematic texture but does not constrain a choice. Strong presence across beats and closure participation.</comment>
