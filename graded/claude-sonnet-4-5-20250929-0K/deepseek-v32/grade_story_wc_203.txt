<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's observational trait is established early and his ghost-seeing ability is integrated into his work, but his choices feel more procedural than conflicted. The ghost encounter is cooperative rather than testing competing impulses—Leo simply listens, solves the puzzle, and the ghost departs satisfied. The "weightless burden" framing recurs but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces Leo to pay a visible cost or forfeit something he values. The ending declares his purpose embraced but doesn't dramatize what he loses or refuses to achieve it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal investigation structure: dust patterns → mainspring barrel → ceiling mechanism → ghost revelation → repair/release. Orientation anchors are present early (elevator tech, circus ticket office). The closure—reassembling the mechanism and freeing the ghost—occurs on the page, but the cost is diffuse: Leo's "burden lighter yet still present" is told rather than shown through a forfeited option or a tactical sacrifice. The drive lens is Causal, but the final beat lacks the sharp before/after that makes cost undeniable. The ghost's cooperation removes friction at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is vivid and specific: faded paint like old bandages, fluorescent buzz, dust swirls near the ticket window. The horologist's mainspring barrel and hidden ceiling compartment constrain Leo's investigation and guide his tactics. The setting does pressure choices—dust patterns dictate his path, the ceiling tile's displacement reveals the mechanism—but the final image doesn't recharge the environment in a way that alters meaning. The space functions well as a stage but doesn't transform at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide and freeing the ghost—is signaled early and drives the investigation. Leo's observation and mechanism repair constitute agency, but the ghost's full cooperation removes opposition; no reversal forces Leo to choose between competing goods or accept a loss. The escalation is steady (dust → object → compartment → ghost → repair) but lacks a moment where success costs Leo something tangible. The resolution feels procedurally earned rather than tested by pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: secrets hidden above drop ceilings, the weight of unseen knowledge, repair as metaphor for releasing trapped pasts. The "weightless burden" motif recurs and is woven into Leo's perception, but the ending articulates theme overtly—"memories, mechanisms, and the ghosts of time"—rather than letting the final image answer the question non-literally. The ghost's peace is granted cleanly without moral ambiguity or a cost that complicates Leo's purpose. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; Leo's perceptual filter—noting cable wear, air pressure shifts, dust stories—is consistent and character-specific. The ghost's dialogue ("rustling paper" voice) is apt, and Leo's steady tone under eerie circumstances fits his established competence. However, several beats rely on filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "understood") that slightly dull immediacy, and the final paragraph's overt theme summary ("forever observant, forever engaged") shifts into a more distant, retrospective register that softens the closure's punch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally strong; the investigation sequence advances without major loops. However, "weightless burden" recurs four times with slight variations but no meaningful reweighting, trending toward motif churn. The phrase "cracks in the façade" appears twice, once literal (ticket booth plaster) and once metaphorical (paint as "ghosts of their former selves"), creating mild register drift. The final two paragraphs paraphrase the theme and Leo's purpose in adjacent passes ("discovering what ceilings hide: memories, mechanisms…" then "his purpose… repairing elevators and occasionally, souls"), which reads as a summary loop rather than propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The elevator-tech-who-sees-ghosts premise is fresh, and the circus clockwork-passage detail is specific. However, the emotional arc—burdened observer finds ghost, solves puzzle, frees spirit, feels lighter—follows a familiar paranormal-resolution template without a non-obvious moral calculus or cost. The "weightless burden" paradox is intriguing but remains more poetic than causally integrated. The ending's overt articulation of meaning ("memories, mechanisms, and the ghosts of time") and the tidy mutual satisfaction (ghost freed, Leo's purpose affirmed) reduce surprise and friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Leo's dual role (elevator tech / ghost-seer) is established early and frames the investigation. His observation drives the discovery sequence (dust → barrel → ceiling mechanism), but his choices are procedural rather than dilemma-driven. He speaks to the ghost, listens, follows the hint, and repairs the mechanism without internal conflict or a decision that forecloses an alternative. The character is present across all beats and participates in the ending, but removing the ghost-seeing trait would require only modest rewrites—he could solve the mechanical puzzle through professional skill alone. Score reflects solid setup and development but limited causal necessity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears in three beats: discovered under tickets, identified as matching the ceiling gears, and reinstalled to complete the mechanism. It enables the repair that frees the ghost, linking directly to closure. However, its properties are generic—any clockwork part would serve the same function with minor edits. The object is described (tarnished brass, delicate teeth) but not handled in a way that reveals character or imposes a tactical cost. It functions as a plot key rather than an irreplaceable element whose specificity matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" appears twice: literal fissures in the ticket booth plaster that reveal hollow spaces and whisper, and metaphorically as peeling paint. The cracks enable Leo's discovery of the hidden compartment, shaping the investigation's middle turn. At closure, Leo "seals the cracks… as best he could," which reprises the element but doesn't reweight its meaning—it's a tidy gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. The concept drives one key beat but feels more thematic ornament than indispensable stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is established in paragraph three and demonstrated throughout: noticing cable wear, air pressure shifts, dust patterns, the loose ceiling tile, the ghost's gestures. The trait enables every discovery beat and is essential to the investigation's causality. However, it never constrains Leo or imposes a tradeoff—his observation is frictionless competence without a blind spot or cost. The attribute is integral to method but not tested by pressure that forces him to choose between competing uses of his attention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Engage" (speaking to the ghost, "I see you. Tell me your story") occurs at the story's hinge: it shifts Leo from investigator to interlocutor and prompts the ghost's revelation, which then directs Leo to the ceiling mechanism. The action is dramatized on the page and directly enables the closure sequence. However, it's a cooperative exchange rather than a choice under competing pressure, and a near-synonym (e.g., "ask," "address") would serve the same function. The beat is essential but the specific verb is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Analyzing dust accumulation is introduced in paragraph ten, demonstrated in paragraphs eleven–twelve (dust stories, swirls, absences along baseboards), and its output (worn paths leading to the back room) guides Leo's investigation. The method appears early and shapes his approach, but after the initial beats it fades—the ceiling mechanism and ghost revelation don't require further dust analysis. It drives the setup and one middle choice but doesn't constrain the ending or return with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is established early and furnishes specific pressures: fluorescent buzz signaling ghost presence, dust patterns revealing hidden activity, the ticket booth's cracked plaster and hollow spaces, the ceiling compartment. The setting enables the investigation and houses the mechanism that Leo repairs. However, its circus history is more atmospheric than causal—the clockwork-passage detail enriches backstory but doesn't alter Leo's present tactics. The setting is integral to the mystery but slightly generic as "abandoned building with hidden mechanism."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fluorescent buzz dying off appears twice: paragraph six (buzz dies, Leo feels ghost presence) and the final paragraph (buzz now silent after closure). It signals the ghost's arrival and marks the resolution, but it doesn't tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Leo's investigation proceeds at his own pace without time pressure. The element is a sensory marker rather than a constraint that alters tactics. It reprises at closure but the reprise is confirmatory rather than reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is stated explicitly in paragraph eight, grounded in a childhood incident (spirit in a ceiling corner), and drives Leo's inspection of the drop ceiling. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Leo pursues the mystery without hesitation or cost. At closure, the motivation is fulfilled and articulated overtly: "he had discovered what ceilings hide: memories, mechanisms, and the ghosts of time." The element frames the investigation but lacks friction or a trade-off that would show the cost of satisfying it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" recurs four times: paragraph two (constant awareness), paragraph seven (settling on his shoulders), paragraph twenty-four (knowledge now his to carry), and paragraphs twenty-seven and twenty-nine (lighter yet still present, his to bear). The phrase establishes tone and threads through the piece, but its meaning remains static—a paradoxical descriptor of Leo's ghost-seeing without deepening or modulating under pressure. The final reprise declares the burden "lighter" and "embraced as his purpose" but doesn't dramatize the shift through image or sacrifice. The tone is coherent but the element functions more as a poetic label than a dynamic charge.</comment>
