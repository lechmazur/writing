<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is stated clearly ("compulsion carved by salt and wind") but never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a difficult choice. Her actions follow a smooth, uncontested path from tree to tree without internal friction or visible cost—she begins the work and completes it without struggle, doubt, or sacrifice. The "restless heart" of the euphony is mentioned but not embodied in her own contradictory impulses. No micro-choice or forfeited path makes the final act feel earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines and maintains a stable Accumulative/Textural lens: the prophet moves from tree to tree, layering resonances into a pattern that culminates in the struck note. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each beat is additive without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure image (struck note organizing harmonies) lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("her work was complete, for now") rather than felt or forfeited; no visible price or foreclosed path anchors the ending. The Orientation Test passes, but closure cost legibility is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood ring, and blue hour are vivid and purposefully detailed. The mallet and trees constrain her method (she taps trunks, reads resonances), shaping her tactics across multiple beats and charging the final struck note. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her cloud-reading, instrument-making perspective. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) qualifies and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (orchestrate the grove) is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or obstacle that forces a trade-off. Each beat is additive—she moves from tree to tree, the pattern grows—without a reversal, tightening, or moment where success becomes uncertain. The struck note "organizes" the harmonies, but no visible cost or forfeited option accompanies the resolution. Escalation reads as accumulation of detail rather than narrowing of choices or raising of stakes under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of turning obstacles into instruments emerges organically through the prophet's actions with the orchard and mallet. The "sketched resonance" and "Root Chorus" offer concrete images that accumulate meaning without overt moralizing. However, the final image does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it delivers exactly what the opening promised (completion of the work) without ambiguity, complexity, or felt cost. The ending offers closure but not resonance; no prior particular is re-seen or repriced by the struck note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (cloud-reading, sound as visible sketches). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with character-specific idiom ("dubbing," "restless euphony," "fractal generating"). However, elevated register ("compulsion carved by salt and wind," "sketched resonance," "restless euphony") is applied uniformly across emotional beats without modulation under pressure, and several phrases ("creeping silence," "colossal wooden instrument") lean toward stock lyricism. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains stable, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Several lines loop conceptually: "obstacles" repeated three times in quick succession, "sketched resonance" defined twice, and the "restless euphony" both dubbed and then re-described. Template cadence is light (varied sentence openings, no runs of identical stems). Clarity is maintained, but density does not increase or shift at the closure beat to elevate the final image. Minor scaffold ("the one known as") and stock modifiers ("pure frequency," "perfect, turbulent harmony") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (floating orchard as instrument, sound made visible as "sketched resonance") offers a fresh synthesis of music, landscape, and mysticism. Execution is competent and the prophet's method (fractal generating, cloud-reading) is character-specific. However, the arc is predictable—she begins the work, completes it without complication, and the closure delivers exactly what the opening forecasts. No turn or reweighting arises from prior particulars to surprise in hindsight. The transformation test is marginal: swap the prophet for another musician and the emotional logic holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her actions (moving tree to tree, striking, dubbing, raising mallet, striking final note) drive all beats. However, no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path—she executes a plan without obstacle, doubt, or cost. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure and cost connection are absent. Swappable with "musician" or "composer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("drew a single xylophone mallet"), used across multiple beats (tapping trunks, tracing air, striking final driftwood), and present in the closing image ("placed the mallet against her heart"). The mallet enables her method and charges the ending. However, its unique properties (felt head worn smooth) are mentioned but do not constrain or enable a specific tactic under pressure. Two gates strong (setup, payoff), middle development light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Defined early ("sketched resonance… faint, lingering outline of sound's potential") and mentioned across beats, but it functions as texture rather than causal pressure. It does not constrain choice or change tactics—she reads it, but the plot would hold if she simply "heard" or "sensed" harmonies. Ornamental use without cost connection or irreplaceability. Setup and closure mention present, but development and causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("interpreted cloud movements… as shifting notation") and mentioned twice (clouds shift, she modulates; final line she watches clouds again). However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—her cloud-reading informs her method but does not force a trade-off or alter the outcome. Label-only integration without visible stakes or tradeoff. Setup and payoff present, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>She dubs the emerging pattern "Root Chorus" in the middle section, cementing its place in the symphony. The act of naming appears once and is framed as significant ("the act of dubbing cementing its place"), but the story does not turn on this action—removing it would not break the sequence. Present in development but not at closure; functional but replaceable. Setup light, development present, closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("method was one of fractal generating") and described in the middle ("starting from a single note and letting it branch… expanding, intricate lattice"). However, the mechanics do not matter—we never see how fractal logic shapes her choices or alters tactics under pressure. Summary-only use without causal demonstration. Setup and development present via description, but no cost or constraint tied to the method. Swappable with "layering" or "building."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout as the arena and instrument. The orchard's interconnected roots enable the "Root Chorus" (middle), and the driftwood ring provides the final struck note (closure). The setting is not merely backdrop—it supplies the tools and constraints (tapping trees, striking driftwood) that drive every beat and charge the ending. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; causal pressure and closure linkage clear. Irreplaceability high: removing the floating orchard breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mentioned in the opening ("blue hour draped the world") and at closure ("the blue hour deepened, and the first star appeared"). However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the prophet works at her own pace with no clock pressure or deadline. Atmospheric rather than functional. Setup and closure participation present, but no middle pressure or cost tied to the timeframe. Swappable with "dusk" or "twilight."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stated explicitly early ("lifelong motivation… to turn obstacles into instruments") and demonstrated through her actions (sea, orchard, silence all become instruments). However, the motivation is never conflicted—no competing want or cost tests her commitment. The ending reiterates the motivation without friction ("watched the clouds once more, already interpreting the next movement"). Setup and development present via action, but no cost or trade-off dramatized. Told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The phrase "restless euphony" appears once in the middle section, describing the orchard's emerging sound ("restless euphony of creaks, tones, and shimmering overtones") and is echoed at closure ("The restless euphony found its temporary peace"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (building tension, then resolution), charging the final image. Lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure light but closure linkage clear.</comment>
