<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ezra's volcanic tenderness motive is striking but remains largely declarative; the interiority leans poetic ("analytically intuitive mind," "heart hardened by the fire") rather than embodied contradiction. The arc from arsonist to curator reads thematically clean but the intermediate choices lack micro-resistance—no moment where guilt and resolve visibly collide in a difficult trade-off. The final decision to create art trails feels inevitable from the premise rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: fragment → cipher → archive → vandalized portrait → hidden map → seed vault → art trail. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Ezra becomes curator, reframing the library fire as "prelude"), and the cost registers conceptually—abandoning the grid, committing to patient guardianship. The drive lens is Causal with strong linkage, though the protagonist's agency in the final act (creating the art trail) is more reported than dramatized, softening the on-page cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive is vividly anchored: cool air, art-lined walls, circular chamber, waterfall entrance, and the room-sized diorama with glowing plants. The vandalized portrait's scraped face revealing the map beneath is a strong tactile detail that directly enables the climactic discovery. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the trail, and the environment (the hidden passage, the diorama) constrains Ezra's choices and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens as Ezra deciphers the fragment, navigates the archive, and interprets the vandalism. The vandalized portrait reversal (concealment, not destruction) narrows options and drives the climax. However, the final escalation (deciding to create an art trail) is more thematic resolution than a pressure-tested choice with on-page trade-off; the cost is conceptual (patient guardianship) but not visibly contested in the moment, keeping the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the art-as-memory premise and the vandalism-as-concealment reversal, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "rescuer redeemed" phrase, which edges toward summary. The seed vault as renewal and Ezra's shift from destroyer to curator offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the forgetting/rescue question. The tapestry fragment and art trail motifs accumulate purposefully, and the "volcanic tenderness" metaphor charges the ending without forcing a moral, though the last lines ("forgotten was remembered") drift slightly into thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, lyric register ("volcanic tenderness," "desperate tenderness," "cooled lava"). The narrative distance occasionally slips into summary ("their analytically intuitive mind, trained to spot patterns") that reads more like prompt echo than embodied perception. Psychic distance modulates appropriately across beats, and the final image maintains voice coherence, but the lexicon leans abstract-poetic in peak moments where concrete sensory detail would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm, but several phrases loop or echo prompt language: "analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness" (used three times), "desperate tenderness," "forgotten promise" (thrice). The vandalized-portrait beat is vivid and propulsive; the diorama description balances detail and momentum. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines ("trailing," "following," "trail" cluster; "tenderness" recycled without fresh angle), applying a −0.4 deduction for template cadence in thematic language. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, keeping the score in the 7.0 neighborhood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The vandalism-as-concealment reversal is a strong, non-obvious twist that reframes the portrait from destruction to protection. The art-as-archive premise and the seed-vault payoff feel fresh within the lost-civilization frame. However, the arsonist-turned-curator arc and the "create an art trail to guide the next finder" ending lean toward familiar redemption templates. The "analytically intuitive" trait and "volcanic tenderness" phrases read as prompt artifacts rather than organic character invention, limiting the sense of singular vision despite the conceptual ingenuity of the hidden map.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ezra's arsonist identity frames the opening and closing (fire as prelude, becoming curator), participating in the thematic arc. The role is setup and payoff but does not create a mid-story turn; Ezra's choices in the archive (following the trail, interpreting the vandalism) would function identically if they were a researcher or wanderer. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with lyric resonance but no middle causal pressure, placing the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in beat one (discovery in ash), drives the geographic cipher (beat two: leads to mountains), and is explicitly placed "at the very beginning" of the new art trail in the final paragraph, reweighting it as first clue for the next finder. Three-gate integration (setup, middle enabler, closure reprise) with clear causal work and irreplaceability—without it, Ezra has no cipher and no start to the new trail. Strong candidate for higher score, but the fragment's specific properties (the spiraling script) are described once and not revisited in the payoff, capping specificity credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is the story's central mystery and reversal mechanism. It appears midway (circular chamber), its defacement drives Ezra's analytical work (beat: studying cuts, peeling canvas), and the hidden map beneath it unlocks the final chamber and seed vault, directly shaping closure. The portrait's dual nature (destruction/concealment) reweights the entire archive's logic and Ezra's understanding of the curator's sacrifice. Three gates with high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; the exact vandalism matters to the map reveal and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is declared in paragraph one and again in paragraph three ("their analytical mind whirring, intuition whispering"). It enables the cipher-solving and vandalism interpretation, but those beats are summarized rather than dramatized—no visible trade-off where intuition conflicts with logic or imposes cost. The trait functions as a label that greenlights competence without constraining action or creating friction. Present in setup and middle but not integrated with cost, landing in the 4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Portray" structures the ending: Ezra decides not to write or broadcast but to "portray" via art trail, and the story's meta-layer (history portrayed in image/form) runs throughout. The action is setup (archive stores history in art), developed (Ezra reads the trail), and paid off (Ezra creates a new trail), satisfying all three gates. However, the final portrayal is recounted in summary ("began to create") rather than shown in a dramatized beat, and the verb could swap to "guide" or "mark" without major rewrites, limiting irreplaceability to ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is introduced early (mosaic path, frescoed corridor, sculptures in paragraph two), guides Ezra through the archive in beat three ("following a trail"), and is mirrored in Ezra's closure action (creating a new trail from mountain base to waterfall). Three-gate integration with clear causal and thematic work: the method teaches Ezra how to communicate and shapes the final choice. The mechanics (art as chapter/memory) are signaled and matter to both discovery and resolution, though the new trail's construction is summarized rather than shown in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is introduced by end of paragraph one (entrance behind waterfall, paragraph two), supplies the art trail and hidden passage that enable discovery (middle beats), and houses the seed vault diorama that defines the promise Ezra guards (closure). The setting's structure (circular chamber, narrow forgotten passage) directly constrains navigation and discovery. Three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the archive's specific design (art-lined, labyrinthine) is irreplaceable to both the mystery and Ezra's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned in paragraph one as context (past decision) and implicit in the final choice (remaining as curator), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create pressure. The three weeks of solitude are noted in passing without affecting tactics. The element reads as background rather than a live constraint; it could be "after retiring" or "after exile" with no structural change. Setup presence but no middle development or closure cost, capping at ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "rescue a forgotten promise" is declared in paragraph two ("heart began to crack with desperate tenderness"), drives the vandalism interpretation ("core of the mystery"), and defines the closure choice (becoming curator, guardian of the green promise). Three-gate structure with clear thematic alignment. However, the desire is more asserted than dramatized—no on-page moment where rescuing the promise conflicts with self-preservation or escape, and the final act (creating the art trail) proceeds without visible hesitation or cost, keeping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is introduced in paragraph one (motive for arson), modulates in paragraph two ("desperate tenderness"), and closes the story ("tenderness as deep and potent as cooled lava"). The tone charges the final image and remains coherent across the arc from destruction to guardianship. However, the phrase is repeated verbatim three times without fresh inflection, and the diction ("volcanic," "cooled lava") leans abstract-poetic rather than embodied in Ezra's perception under pressure. Lyric reprise with closure resonance but limited modulation, mid-6s.</comment>
