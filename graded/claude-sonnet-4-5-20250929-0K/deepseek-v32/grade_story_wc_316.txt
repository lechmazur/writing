<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat numbness is stated but remains abstract; the "phantom sensation" and "tightened chest" in the custody scene arrive too suddenly without prior embodied struggle. The final warmth feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Master Liren is functional but one-note, and the lawyers are props. The complement-opposites method needed more on-page friction in Kael's attempts before the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Kael offers "the quiet space where emotion could finally live," the brain pulses with internal rhythm, and custody is granted. The causal lens holds—Liren's teaching leads to Kael's attempt, which vivifies the duplicate. Cost is present but oblique: Kael feels "the faintest warmth," implying partial recovery, yet the price of his method and what he forecloses remains understated. Orientation is prompt (dojo, sky, ego death survivor by line three).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting-history sky are vivid but remain postcard elements; they do not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The brain-jar is described but handled only in the final beat. Spatial choreography is clear (stone rail, central hall, pedestal), yet the setting does not pressure Kael's tactics—he could attempt vivification anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify the clone, defeat numbness) is clear. The custody battle provides external pressure, and Kael's interior shift—recognizing "a will to protect"—narrows his options and drives the climax. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lawyer's scorn triggers the "phantom sensation." Cost is legible but muted: Kael gains warmth, the clone awakens, custody shifts—yet what Kael sacrifices or forecloses is not sharply defined on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the complement-opposites teaching and Kael's ego-death void reframed as vessel rather than lack. The final image (brain pulsing, warmth felt) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The "Brother" thought and the judge's pronouncement ("custody is granted to the whole") resonate without abstraction. Minor slip: "slices through his own pretense of complete numbness" nearly states the theme rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Distance is controlled, and the perceptual filter (numb, flat affect, "ghost of sensation") remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Liren's "grinding stone" voice and the lawyer's scornful pointing are specific. Minor register drift: "complement-opposites" and "vivify" read slightly elevated for Kael's interior lexicon under peak stress, though the teaching context justifies them.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; sentences advance character and world. Minor loop: "ego death" appears three times in exposition without evolving meaning; "complementary opposites" is repeated across teaching and climax without tonal shift. No major artifacts touch the closure beat. Figurative language (banners/spacecraft in clouds, "blade of clarity") is functional but conventional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo, rewriting history, and clone-custody premise combine into a specific synthesis, yet each element remains somewhat generic (martial mysticism, sci-fi legal drama, identity clone). The complement-opposites method is fresh in application—void as vessel rather than lack—and Kael's interior journey transforms the stock "find your feelings" arc. Risk-taking is moderate; the conceptual frame is bold but execution plays safe in the climax (lawyers vanish "in a huff of temporal static" is convenient).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael (ego death survivor) is present throughout and his choices drive two key beats: recognizing "a will to protect" when the lawyer points at him, and placing his hand on the jar to vivify the clone. His survivor status frames motivation and the climax method (void as vessel). He shapes setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brain-jar appears in beat one (Liren's introduction), beat two (Kael spends hours before it, it glows brighter), and beat three (Kael places hand on glass, it pulses with internal rhythm, "Brother" thought). The label DUPLICATE is noted but not reweighted. The jar is handled and its state changes (flickering → pulsing with deep rhythm), shaping the final image. Swappable with "preserved clone body" but the brain specificity adds conceptual charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clone custody battle frames the external conflict, brings lawyers to the dojo, and triggers Kael's protective spark. The hearing is dramatized on-page, and the judge's ruling ("custody is granted to the whole") resolves both legal and thematic stakes. It shapes setup (years-old failed procedure), middle beat (lawyers' arrival and scornful claim), and closure (hearing, vivification, ruling). The battle is the hinge for all pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" appears once as interiority ("a new, clean blade of clarity form within. It sliced through his own pretense of complete numbness") but does not constrain an earlier choice or recur with cost. The metaphor is vivid yet the attribute remains label-only, not demonstrated through prior action or trade-off. No setup, brief middle mention, no closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivify is the climax action: Kael's method (channeling void as vessel) causes the brain to pulse with internal rhythm and the "Brother" thought to echo. The entire arc builds toward this act; Liren's teaching, Kael's hours of practice, and the custody stakes all converge on whether Kael can vivify the duplicate. The action is irreplaceable and defines the closure. Setup (Liren explains), development (Kael practices), payoff (vivification succeeds).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Complementary opposites is taught early (Liren: "rage countered by stillness, grief by vast accepting silence"), practiced mid-story (Kael focuses on "profound emptiness after loss, calm that follows terror"), and executed at closure (void as vessel). The method shapes Kael's attempts and the final success. Mechanics are signaled but remain somewhat abstract—how exactly stillness counters rage on the page is told, not shown. Present in all three beats, drives the vivification, but could be more concretely demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is described early (opening line) and mentioned at closure ("the dojo's hall"), but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The "worn rock" contrasts with lawyers' "sharp suits," adding atmospheric tension, yet the setting is ornamental—vivification could occur in any location. Setup present, no middle development where the dojo's properties matter, passive presence at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>History rewriting appears in the opening ("clouds sometimes showed legion banners or extinct spacecraft"), during the hearing ("empires rose and fell in the vistas below"), and seems to pause at closure ("rewriting history outside seemed to pause"). Yet it does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline; the temporal flux is backdrop, not constraint. Present across beats but does not shape tactics or cost. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Kael's stated motivation (opening) and the arc's through-line. His hours before the jar, the "phantom sensation" when lawyers scorn him, and the final "faintest warmth" all dramatize this desire with friction (he feels nothing, yet seeks feeling). The motivation drives his choice to vivify and charges the closure image. Cost is visible: partial recovery implies ongoing struggle. Setup, development (protective spark), payoff (warmth felt).</comment>
