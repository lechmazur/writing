<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated early but never tested by genuine internal conflict. Her "mossy delight" functions as a constant mood label rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The transformation at line 34 ("She felt a transformation within herself") arrives as summary assertion without dramatized struggle or visible cost. The spirit's final words about transformation read as thematic echo rather than earned character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, waiving the Q2 deduction. However, closure lacks visible cost—the sapling sprouts instantly, the arbor greens, and Elara's senses sharpen without trade-off or foreclosed path. The spirit's guidance resolves the decoding task without protagonist struggle; the moonstone dust speck functions as a convenience key. Drive lens reads Causal but the because/therefore chain relies on external gifts (spirit narration, instant sprouting) rather than protagonist agency at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described and the "perpetual twilight" establishes atmosphere. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the arbor functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical friction. The brightening sky at line 33 is a consequence, not a pressure point that alters her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decode the messages) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition. The moonstone speck's expansion and the spirit's exposition hand Elara the solution without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The sapling's instant growth and the arbor's recovery occur without visible cost or foreclosed path. No on-page reversal or tightening choice tests her commitment; luck and external aid resolve the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory and attention emerges from the monuments and the spirit's tales. The final image of thriving monuments and evolving folklore offers some resonance. However, the piece relies on prompt labels ("emerges transformed always," "mossy delight," "forgotten things") as thematic scaffolding rather than earning insight through specific struggle. The spirit's final words ("You emerge transformed always, as does the world") state the theme rather than letting it arise from action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elara. Diction is often elevated and lyric ("charcoal sketches against the pale sky," "grain of starlight") but stays consistent. The perceptual signature leans generic—"mossy delight" recurs as a label rather than a distinct way of noticing. The spirit's dialogue ("It has been ages since one of your kind found the moonstone dust") reads slightly formal but acceptable for an ethereal figure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Template-cadence runs are pervasive: lines 7–10 each open with "Her method involved / Each monument was / Today, as she sorted / It was…" and lines 19–22 cycle through "Elara, filled / The spirit explained / To fully decode / She quickly built." Paraphrase loops appear at lines 25–26 (spirit narrates arbor creation tales, then "The stories told of a time…"). Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching ("milky glow," "rustling leaves," "grain of starlight") but remains legible. Apply −0.9 for template cadence and loops in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—seed sorter discovers magical artifact, meets spirit guide, restores enchanted place—follows a familiar quest-restoration template without fresh inflection. The moonstone dust speck, instant sapling, and cooperative spirit function as convenience gifts rather than specific, hard-won synthesis. "Emerges transformed always" and "mossy delight" recur as prompt labels without deeper particularization. The arbor's renewal feels mechanically signaled rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs actions (sorts seeds, builds monuments, plants the seed). However, her key choices—examining the speck, asking about messages, building the monument around the mist—do not create reversals or alter tactics under pressure. The spirit's guidance and the speck's properties drive the plot; Elara's agency is reactive. She is a conduit rather than a decision-maker whose choices forge turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears early (line 10), is examined (line 12), prodded (line 13), expands into mist (line 14), and solidifies into a moonstone at the monument's center (line 28). Its properties enable the spirit's emergence and the monument's completion. However, the speck's mechanics are given rather than discovered through Elara's effort, and it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Three-gate presence (setup, middle, payoff) but weak causal pressure and no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned early (line 4) and the spirit cites it (line 24). The folklore provides context for the leaves' messages and the arbor's history. However, it functions as exposition rather than shaping Elara's on-page stakes or forcing tactical choices. The folklore is backdrop that validates her task, not a constraint or complication. Setup and middle gates met; closure linkage is thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is explicitly attributed to the spirit (line 16) and applied to Elara (line 26, 36, 44). It recurs as a thematic label but does not constrain or enable specific actions with visible cost. The transformation is asserted in summary ("she felt a transformation," "She emerged transformed always") rather than dramatized through on-page trade-offs. Label-only treatment with no beat-level friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prod (line 13) triggers the speck's expansion into mist, which is the inciting event for the spirit's emergence and the story's central revelation. It appears early and drives the causal chain. However, the prod itself is a simple action without cost or complication; any touch would likely yield the same result, making it somewhat swappable. One strong beat involvement (inciting) but low specificity and no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is introduced early as Elara's established method (line 7–8) and enacted on-page when she builds the monument around the mist (line 21). The spirit explains that monuments are necessary to decode the prophecies (line 20), and the completed monument becomes a focal point for renewal (line 37). Two-beat involvement (introduction and enactment) and the method shapes the middle turn. However, the mechanics are gift-knowledge from the spirit rather than hard-won discovery, and the ending describes monuments in plural without showing their continued construction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly established in the opening line and its condition motivates Elara's work. The arbor's transformation (greening branches, brightening sky) is a consequence of Elara's actions. However, the arbor does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it is setting-as-backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures decisions. Setup and payoff gates met but no middle development friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is introduced early (line 3) and folklore explains it as the time when leaves fall with messages (line 4). The hush is mentioned again at line 40 as the arbor thrives. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten Elara's decisions; events unfold without a clock or deadline. The hush functions as atmosphere rather than a tactical constraint. Setup and thematic reprise but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode the messages is stated early (line 5) and she directly asks the spirit about it (line 18). The decoded message appears on the ground (line 30) and she acts on it by planting the seed. The motivation drives her inquiry and final action. However, it is never conflicted or tested by competing desires; she pursues it without friction or cost. Two-beat involvement (declaration and enactment) but no internal trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is introduced early (line 6) and recurs at lines 18, 39, and 47. It functions as a tonal label for Elara's consistent mood. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image; Elara remains delighted throughout without tonal shift to reflect escalation or cost. The phrase is repeated without evolving meaning. Ornamental recurrence without causal work.</comment>
