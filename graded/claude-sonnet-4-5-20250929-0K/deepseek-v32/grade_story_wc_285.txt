<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eamon's interiority is concrete and his motivation coherent throughout, but the final choice—giving away the yarn needle—lacks genuine internal contradiction or visible cost that would elevate the moment. The old woman's sudden appearance from behind feels convenient rather than earned by Eamon's prior struggle. Embodied emotion is present (fog's chill, horse's snort) but the epiphany about "the promise itself" edges toward unearned insight without sufficient on-page friction to dramatize the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection and sensory detail until the woman's arrival crystallizes meaning. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the palimpsest promise completed by quiet exchange), but the cost is more asserted than dramatized—Eamon's "deep, airy peace" tells resolution rather than showing a path foreclosed. Orientation is clean (coachman, fog-bound crossing, waiting) and the lens holds, but the woman's emergence from the path behind rather than the expected ferry feels like a convenient pivot that bypasses the established tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog-bound crossing is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (plosh of river, drip from eaves, damp reins) that filters through Eamon's professional attention. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, handled across beats and charging the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the gutter's ticking operates as both atmospheric detail and constraint that shapes the waiting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—waiting until the gutters stop—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains largely static rather than escalating. The woman's arrival from behind rather than across the river deflates the ferry tension without replacing it with a harder choice. Eamon's decision to give the needle away carries thematic weight but lacks visible cost or trade-off; he feels serene afterward, suggesting resolution without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the palimpsest metaphor, layered promises, and the shift from transaction to connection. The final exchange between Eamon and the woman—"for mending" / "for remembering what was woven"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the waiting without stating a moral. However, the clean resolution into "airy peace" edges toward tidy satisfaction that undercuts the promised complexity of failed vows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is controlled: Eamon's world filtered through sensory patience and occupational attention. Diction remains consistent, though phrases like "spindrift serenity" and "palimpsest promise" recur with slight over-reliance on the prompt vocabulary. Dialogue between Eamon and the woman is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext effectively in the needle exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but several passages loop conceptually: "the promise itself, not the person" is restated across multiple beats without new pressure. Figurative language is heavy in places—"spongy wall," "ghostly script," "slick, dark surface"—and "spindrift serenity" appears three times, creating template cadence. The phrase "percolate through ambient awareness" directly echoes prompt language without transformation. Sentence openings show some variety but several paragraphs begin with "He" or "The" in close succession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The palimpsest-promise frame offers a fresh angle on regret and waiting, and the coachman's occupation is well-integrated. However, the core turn—waiting not for a passenger but for a moment of connection—feels familiar in its arc of epiphany-through-patience. The woman's emergence from behind rather than arrival by ferry substitutes one waited-for event with another without deepening the stakes, reading as a lateral move rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eamon's choice to wait until the gutters stop frames the story and his decision to give away the needle alters the final beat, but both choices feel more thematic than causally pressured—observation and endurance dominate over decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The yarn needle appears in at least three beats: found in pocket during reflection, held during the woman's arrival, and given away at closure. Its meaning evolves from "tool for mending" to symbolic gift, and the woman's reply reweights it. Strong integration, though the object's causal pressure on Eamon's choices is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The palimpsest concept is signaled early, recurs in reflection about layered vows, and shapes the thematic resolution ("final layer one of acceptance"). However, it operates more as metaphor than on-page constraint—it colors Eamon's interiority but does not decisively alter his tactics or options in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" is demonstrated through Eamon's sensory focus (fog's chill, gutter ticks, horse's snort) and frames his vigil, but the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It enables his patience but never forces a trade-off or limits an action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Percolate" appears once in the phrase "let the question of his missing passenger percolate through ambient awareness," but the action is not repeated or causally pivotal. Eamon's realization could arrive through other means with minor edits; the verb is ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is named early and frames Eamon's mode of perception (listening to the world's signals, feeling the fog, waiting without frantic thought), shaping his stance. However, the method does not demonstrably alter a middle choice or create a visible cost; it describes his state more than it drives action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is present throughout, supplies the gutter-tick constraint that times Eamon's vigil, and delivers the atmospheric pressure that frames his reflection. The crossing's emptiness (absent ferryman, no passenger from the far shore) directly shapes the plot's central absence and the woman's arrival from the path behind reweights the setting's function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-gutter timeframe is signaled early ("promised himself…he would wait until the rain gutters stopped ticking"), tracked across beats ("ticks grew farther apart"), and pays off at closure ("a final drop, then silence"). The ticking metronome tightens Eamon's vigil and the silence marks the moment of exchange, making the timeframe causally active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation "to distill complexity into essence" is stated early and recurs in his reflection about the crossing's silence. The realization that "the promise itself, not the person" is the essence he sought ties to this motivation at closure. However, the desire is more told than dramatized through conflicting choices—Eamon waits patiently without visible friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" is named three times: as diffused light in the fog, as pervasive calm settling within Eamon, and as quiet companion on the road home. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (from mist-light to internal peace), charging the final image of retreat through dawn. However, the repetition of the exact phrase borders on over-reliance rather than organic tonal shift.</comment>
