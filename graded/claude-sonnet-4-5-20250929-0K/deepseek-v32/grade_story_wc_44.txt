<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara exists as a vehicle for world-building rather than a person under pressure. Her "quietly deliberate" movements are asserted three times but never constrain a choice or create friction. Interior life consists of thesis statements about the world ("She saw that shadows at noon now traveled into the bent realities") without contradiction, doubt, or embodied emotion. The final "understanding floods" her—a passive reception that forecloses struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rune alignment and ritual completion accumulate toward a revelatory closure. The closure unit—"shadows at noon now traveled into the bent realities"—lands as Conceptual Repricing but the cost is entirely abstract; no tactic, relationship, or resource was spent to reach it. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately and hold. The "sealed awakenings" unlock off-page, delivered as exposition rather than dramatized consequence, weakening the before/after legibility required for closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, and brass instruments establish vivid atmosphere and remain spatially coherent. However, setting functions as backdrop: no environmental constraint shapes a choice, and the automaton's physical manipulation (key insertion, arm extension) never alters Elara's tactics or options. The "floating rocks outside" and "star-scarred dome" are observed but inert. Micro-setting allowance does not rescue this; the key is handled but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where shadows go at noon"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Elara adjusts dials and aligns runes without resistance, error, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. The automaton's partial then full awakening provides a micro turn but no escalation: the shift from "partially awake" to "whirred fully to life" costs nothing and changes no tactic. At closure, knowledge arrives as gift rather than price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—reality's expansion post-catastrophe, hidden knowledge reclaimed—emerges cleanly from world-building and is reinforced by "not as broken, but as expanded." The piece resists overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges into thesis ("her scholarship had just begun," "woven a new thread into the mended fabric of existence") rather than trusting image. The automaton and key recur but their thematic charge is decorative; removing them would not alter the conceptual resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices runes, stellar positions, shadow patterns. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("sealed awakenings," "cyclical rituals," "symbolic power," "orbital dance," "states of being") that reads as world-building exposition rather than a character's urgent thought under pressure. The phrase "quietly deliberate" is template-recycled. Free indirect style is clean, but lacks rhythmic modulation or embodied compression during the climactic alignment sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Syntax varies and readability is high; no grammar errors. "Quietly deliberate" appears twice identically (paragraph 1, final third)—a paraphrase loop. Multiple sentences open with "The" or "She" in runs, creating mild template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and controlled. Information density is uneven: the middle third lists actions (adjusted dials, aligned telescopes, recorded anomalies) without advancing pressure, while the closure paragraph compresses the revelatory moment into summary ("flooded Elara with understanding"). The final two sentences ("The floating isle drifted on...") are scaffold that restate mood without new charge. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems; no artifact touches closure directly but density sag in Act II lowers momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—spoons bend reality, shadows vanish to elsewhere, rune scholar seeks truth—is imaginative but not transformed through character specificity or moral calculus. "Spoons" as the agent of the Bending reads as quirk-for-quirk's-sake; their properties never constrain choice or recur with charge. The automaton-key-rune-ritual sequence is functional but swappable with any "unlock the puzzle" trope. Emotional truth is absent: Elara's quest concludes without visible sacrifice, doubt, or surprise. No risk-taking in structure or voice; the piece plays it safe within established fantasy-scholar templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (find where shadows go) frames the quest. She makes two plot-relevant choices: inserting the key and aligning the final rune. However, both choices are procedural completions without visible cost or friction; no tactical pivot or sacrifice occurs. She observes and executes a predetermined ritual rather than deciding under conflicting pressures. Present but largely passive; functional but replaceable with any diligent scholar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in three beats: Elara lifts it (paragraph 7), inserts it (paragraph 8), and it "rotates autonomously" at closure (paragraph 16). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the key's mechanics are incidental: it unlocks the automaton, which then points at a constellation—a helper role, not a constraint. Removing the key and having the automaton wake via rune alone would require minor edits but no structural change. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" are mentioned in paragraphs 4, 11, 14, and 17. Setup is met (paragraph 4). They are declared to be "truths about reality's fabric" and "states of being for the isle," shaping Elara's method. At closure they "broke open like invisible waves," but the effect is told rather than shown and no on-page cost is tied to their unsealing. The concept frames stakes but does not alter tactics or options within scenes. Functional but abstract; present in closure but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears three times: as description of Elara's movements (paragraphs 1, 10) and as a label for her general approach (paragraph 15). It is asserted but never tested. No scene shows a moment where her deliberation constrains speed, forces a trade-off, or conflicts with urgency. Label-only; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Relearn" is Elara's stated method (paragraph 5: "she must relearn what had been forgotten") and recurs at closure ("To relearn this was to see the world anew"). However, the on-page action is aligning runes and performing a vigil, not wrestling with forgotten knowledge. The learning itself is summarized in the penultimate paragraph ("flooded Elara with understanding"). The action could be replaced with "rediscover" or "unlock" without structural change. Present and thematically cohesive but mechanically generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is signaled in paragraph 6 ("her method would be by closing loops") and recurs in paragraphs 10, 11, 14, and 15. The concept shapes her tactics: she retraces the founders' vigil, completes the observation cycle, aligns the rune sequence. At closure, "a loop closed at last" triggers the automaton's full awakening and the revelation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method is specific to this story's cosmology and could not be trivially swapped. However, the loop-closing is procedural rather than fraught; no false path or cost accompanies it. Essential but lacks felt friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is anchored in paragraph 1 and recurs throughout. It provides tools (telescopes, runes, automaton) and atmosphere (eternal night, residual energy). The setting enables Elara's work but does not constrain it: no environmental obstacle or pressure alters her choices. The floating rocks and dome are observed but static. The final image ("The floating isle drifted on") reprises the setting but does not reweight it. Present and coherent but postcard-functional; no micro-setting constraint drives a turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" (the Bending) is established in paragraph 2 as backstory context. The timeframe ("since that day") situates the world state but does not create urgency. "As dawn approached...noon would soon test her theories" (paragraph 14) introduces a clock, but Elara completes her work without visible time pressure or adjustment. The timeframe is context, not constraint. Present but not pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find where shadows go at noon"—is declared in paragraph 3 ("a puzzle that consumed her") and resolved in paragraph 17 ("she had found where shadows go at noon"). Setup and payoff are met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized: no scene shows her struggle, doubt, or competing pull. The quest proceeds without friction or cost. The motivation frames the plot but does not conflict with another want or create visible sacrifice. Functional but uncontested.</comment>
