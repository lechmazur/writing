<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria's internal contradiction—seeking peace while haunted—is embodied through somatic markers and freezing responses. The photograph functions well as a concrete anchor for memory, though her therapeutic self-awareness occasionally tips into diagnostic label-speak ("somatic echo, a trap her nervous system had learned"). The final choice to plant a tree and work without freezing shows earned progress, but the path feels somewhat linear rather than genuinely contradictory in the moment. The wedding-survivor backstory is efficiently sketched but remains largely inert summary rather than a live complication that pressures present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates textural density through repetition of somatic work, photograph handling, and arboretum care, building to a closure moment where Aria digs without freezing—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in the form of solitary endurance and ongoing therapeutic labor. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 1). The meaningful deepening occurs when the storm triggers panic but she grounds herself, leaving "a fleeting pearl of stillness"—this shifts her relationship to the practice. Cost is legible in her isolation, the crumpled photograph she won't smooth, and the quiet acceptance of ghosts alongside growth. One minor slip: the lighthouse keeper reference feels ornamental rather than causally integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains Aria's choices (she tends fragile ecosystems, prunes during memory surges, digs to plant a resilient tree) and charges the final image. The seaside cliff, storm, wind, scent of damp earth, and solid bench all anchor somatic grounding exercises. The photograph as micro-object recurs with purposeful handling (pocket, bench, sunset companion). Spatial choreography is clean. The lighthouse detail adds atmosphere but doesn't meaningfully pressure a choice, slightly diluting focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: learning to live again through somatic practice. The storm scene provides one meaningful tightening—panic rises, she uses markers, panic subsides with residue of weariness, then a fleeting pearl of stillness emerges. This deepening forecloses the path of pure avoidance and opens cautious re-engagement. The final act (planting the tree, digging without freezing) is driven by Aria's cumulative practice and her agency. Cost is visible in her solitude, the photograph she keeps crumpled, and theghosts she must carry. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights survival with earned optimism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through concrete particulars: the crumpled photograph she won't smooth, somatic markers that guide rather than alarm, the pearl cultivated rather than found. The final image (digging steady-handed, no freeze, photograph still in pocket) reweights prior material without stating a moral. However, "optimism, anchored in the realism of scars and growth, became her daily practice" is an overly explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph that short-circuits earned resonance. The somatic-work method risks therapeutic abstraction but stays mostly grounded in bodily sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focus on Aria; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature (noticing tightness in chest, cold in fingers, scent of damp earth) reflects her therapeutic training without excessive filter verbs. Diction stays character-appropriate except for one slip: "drone strike that had turned celebration into carnage" reads slightly elevated for the quiet voice established elsewhere. No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "pearl of stillness her therapist described" is clean free indirect style. Narrative certainty matches Aria's knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or somatic practice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity and concision are strong. Minor issue: "The arboretum, with its curated peace, was her training ground" and "the arboretum thrived under her care" employ slightly stock phrasing. Figurative language ("pearl of stillness," "diver in deep waters") is controlled and voice-motivated. Propulsion is steady, slowing appropriately for reflective beats without stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of trauma recovery through somatic therapy in an arboretum setting offers a fresh synthesis. The crumpled photograph detail (creases as part of truth) and the shift from "finding" to "cultivating" the pearl feel specific and earned. However, the lighthouse keeper reference is ornamental rather than integral, and the "drone strike wedding survivor" premise risks stock trauma-narrative territory. The story commits fully to its therapeutic frame and delivers on it with specificity, but the final turn (planting a resilient tree) is somewhat predictable given the gardening metaphor established throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone strike wedding survivor identity is present by line 6, frames her solitude and therapeutic work throughout, and shapes the ending decision to plant and continue living. It drives the freeze response and the need for somatic grounding. However, the backstory remains largely summary rather than a live complication that pressures specific choices in the present. The survivor identity enables the therapeutic arc but could be swapped for other PTSD origins with minor edits. Gates: setup ✓, development (middle storm scene) ✓, payoff (final paragraph references "drone strike wedding survivor") ✓. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in line 5 (pocket), line 20 (bench, held gently), line 34 (beside her on bench), and final paragraph (remains in pocket). It recurs with reweighted meaning: she won't smooth the creases (truth acceptance), places it as silent companion to sunset, then keeps it as touchstone. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Three distinct beats. However, it is handled but not causally active—it anchors memory but doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Charged reprise qualifies for mid-6s under the lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness is introduced at line 16 ("her therapist described"), pursued in line 18, experienced fleetingly at line 27, and realized as something to cultivate (not find) at line 42. It shapes the dominant stake (seeking inner calm amid turmoil) and reweights her understanding by the end. Gates: setup ✓ (first third), development ✓ (storm scene fleeting experience), payoff ✓ (cultivate realization). However, it remains somewhat abstract—a therapeutic concept rather than a concrete constraint that alters tactics. The shift from "find" to "cultivate" adds specificity and cost (ongoing effort).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" appears in line 2 (tending exotic plants), line 19 (nurturing fragile ecosystems mirrors internal work), and line 31 (arboretum thrives under her care). Final line echoes "quietly talented." Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. The talent enables her arboretum work and provides the ecosystem-as-metaphor for internal healing, but it doesn't constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff. It's consistent label-level characterization without on-page cost tied to the talent itself. Mentioned but not pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The freeze action appears at line 9 ("felt her body freeze"), line 10 ("freezing was a somatic echo"), and is overcome at line 39 ("felt no urge to freeze"). It defines the problem her somatic work addresses and marks the ending's progress. Gates: setup ✓ (first third), development ✓ (she anticipates triggers that make her freeze, line 30), payoff ✓ (absence of freeze at closure signals change). Three beats. The presence/absence of freezing redefines her options and drives the therapeutic arc. Causal role is strong; removing it would collapse the somatic-marker method and the ending's victory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced at line 11 ("her therapist had explained"), used actively at lines 12-13 (focusing on tightness, cold, acknowledging sensations), and again at lines 24-25 (storm scene: she uses markers to stay grounded, notices breath/bench/scent). Line 40 states "somatic markers were now guides, not alarms." Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (storm scene application), payoff ✓ (guides-not-alarms realization). Two active uses plus final reweighting. The method shapes her tactics and the closure realization, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—naming sensations to drain power is told more than shown in granular action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff is established in line 1, recurs as sanctuary (line 1), training ground (line 15), and frames nearly every beat. The cliff setting provides waves (line 4, rhythmic crash offers solace), wind and storm (line 23), damp earth scent (line 25), and soil for planting (line 38). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (storm pressure), payoff ✓ (digging into soil at closure). The setting supplies sensory anchors for grounding exercises, pressures her during the storm, and enables the final planting act. The arboretum's fragile ecosystems mirror her internal work. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" appears in line 3 and the final paragraph. The timeframe establishes abandonment and automation, reinforcing Aria's solitude, but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The lighthouse keeper's own solitudes (line 37) add thematic echo but no causal pressure. Gates: setup ✓, payoff ✓ (bookend mention), but missing middle development. The temporal frame is atmospheric rather than tactic-altering. Swappable with other markers of isolation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly at line 8, demonstrated through her refusal to smooth photograph creases (line 22, "part of the truth"), and restated at line 43 ("optimism, anchored in the realism of scars and growth"). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (photograph handling shows dual acknowledgment), payoff ✓ (final statement). The desire shapes her therapeutic approach and the ending's acceptance of ghosts alongside growth. However, the friction is more told than dramatized—she wants both, and achieves both, without a scene where optimism and realism clash in a forced choice. The motivation guides rather than conflicts.</comment>
