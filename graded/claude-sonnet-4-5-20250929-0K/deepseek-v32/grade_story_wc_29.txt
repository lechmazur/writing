<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "outwit cosmic tricksters" is established early, but her interior experience relies heavily on summarized reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to draft a unity report reads as a thesis-driven conclusion rather than one earned through on-page struggle; the moment when the voice tells her "you outwit yourselves" functions as delivered wisdom rather than discovery forged under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin—most tension arrives through conceptual framing ("cautious hope," "dread") rather than physical contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous scene in causal mode: Elara transmits subsonic frequencies, receives a response, interprets it, and decides to propose unity. However, the closure—drafting a report and stepping outside ready to "bridge the chasm"—is a stated intention rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The voice's revelation that they are "reflectors" reframes the problem conceptually, but the story tells us Elara has clarity rather than showing a path foreclosed or a trade-off paid. Cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio station is anchored with functional detail (console, speakers, tape reels, transmitters) and the astronomical charts are handled across multiple beats. The subsonic frequencies create a floor vibration, grounding the method in sensory specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—Elara's decision to draft a report could occur anywhere. The charts reappear in the final third as "diagrams of human conflict," a thematic metaphor rather than a tactical constraint, preventing entry to the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing a catastrophic community choice—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice responds and reframes the signals as reflections rather than deceptions, which narrows Elara's understanding. However, escalation is conceptual rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the voice delivers the insight, and Elara's "interference" does not visibly foreclose an option or force a trade-off on the page. The resolution (drafting a report) is announced rather than enacted with cost, keeping this below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of internal division magnified by external forces emerges through the trickster-reflector conceit and is reinforced by the charts-as-conflict metaphor. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly—"perhaps a divided community could find a single, steadfast voice"—stating the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. The core insight arrives via the voice's direct explanation ("We are reflectors. You outwit yourselves"), which reads as authorial thesis rather than discovery earned through concrete struggle. Thematic resonance is present but declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with consistent psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature emphasizes astronomical and signal-processing detail, creating a lightly technical idiom. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("ethereal grit," "grinding starlight") that clash with the established voice during high-pressure beats. The dialogue with the voice is functional but brief; Elara's reply "I do" is serviceable yet generic. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The prose remains legible but does not achieve rhythmic distinction under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, and sentence openings vary. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The community was divided, but…" echoes earlier framing; "Her eyes returned to the charts" / "She realized her interference needed to evolve" / "She powered down the station" follow an iterative [Subject + verb + object] stem across adjacent beats without pattern-teaching. Stock phrases ("grinding starlight," "ethereal grit") recur without added pressure. The loop/scaffold screen flags synonym churn in the final third ("charts now seeming like diagrams," "charts, the frequencies, the power plays—all were threads"), which dulls momentum rather than propelling it. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce information density, warranting −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap and preventing entry to the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The cosmic-trickster premise offers a science-fiction gloss on internal-division themes, but the resolution—"To outwit the cosmic tricksters was to first confront the schisms within"—is an explicitly stated thesis rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in hindsight. The subsonic-frequency method and the reflector reveal are functional genre moves, yet the emotional arc (isolated scientist receives clarifying message, decides to unify community) follows a template structure without fresh inflection. The voice's explanation removes ambiguity rather than layering it, and the final image (stepping outside "ready to bridge the chasm") is a declaration of intent rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes two on-page choices: to transmit subsonic frequencies and to draft a unity report. The first choice triggers the voice's response (causal involvement in escalation); the second is stated at closure but not enacted with visible cost. She is introduced early and her role as interpreter frames the conflict, satisfying setup and development gates. However, at closure she "began drafting a report"—an intention rather than a completed action—so closure participation is weak. The element shapes one key turn (the transmission) but the final choice does not demonstrate irreplaceability or felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astronomical charts are handled in the opening beat ("traced a finger"), used to map signal origins and identify the Cygnus Arm resonant point (development), and return in the final third when Elara sees them as "diagrams of human conflict" (reprise with reweighted meaning). All three gates are met. However, the charts enable research but do not constrain a high-pressure choice—Elara could derive the resonant point from any celestial database. The lyric reprise charges theme but does not alter tactics or cost at closure. Swappability and the lack of a specific on-page cost tied to the charts limit the score to the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Power plays among Professor Kline and Dr. Mirren are described in exposition ("erupted daily in departmental meetings and terse emails") but never dramatized on the page. The concept is mentioned as background context and reflected thematically in the voice's revelation ("The power plays within the university were not just petty; they were being exploited"), yet it does not shape Elara's tactics or narrow her options in any enacted beat. Setup is present; development and closure participation are absent. The element is ornamental to the lived conflict, scoring in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in exposition ("Elara remained cautiously hopeful") and restated in the final paragraph ("With cautious hope renewed"), but the trait never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. It describes her stance rather than forcing a trade-off—nothing in her transmission attempt or decision to draft a report hinges on moderate optimism versus bold confidence or defensive retreat. The attribute appears early and at closure but remains a thematic label without causal pressure or demonstrated friction. This is label-only use, capping the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's interference via subsonic transmission is the story's central action: she activates the plan, calibrates equipment, directs the beam, and receives the voice's response. The action is signaled early ("She had to interfere, but covertly"), drives the middle escalation (the transmission and reply), and is referenced at closure ("Her interference through subsonic frequencies had not summoned monsters but had revealed a profound test"). All three gates are met with strong causal pressure. However, the action does not directly shape the final image—Elara's decision to draft a report is a separate move—so closure linkage is indirect. Specificity and beat involvement are high, but the lack of tight closure integration prevents entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are introduced in the middle third ("directed a beam through subsonic frequencies, a low hum beneath human hearing") and used to generate the transmission that triggers the voice's response. The method is signaled with mechanical detail (floor vibration, layered rhythm from pulsar maps) and its properties matter—subsonic range is "beneath human hearing," allowing covert operation. Setup is weak (late introduction), but development and closure participation are present: the method is referenced in the final third as the vehicle of Elara's revelation. Swappability is moderate; any exotic frequency band could serve the same function with minor edits. Score is mid-5s due to late signal and modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The university radio station is named early and supplies the console, transmitters, and tape reels that enable Elara's transmission. It provides resources (setup and development gates met) but does not pressure a choice—Elara's decision-making would be identical in any equipped signal facility. At closure she "powered down the station" and "stepped from the radio station," but these are exit choreography rather than causal participation. The setting is functional and logically consistent but replaceable with any observatory or communications lab. No micro-setting constraint alters tactics or charges the final image, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the community divides" is established in exposition and restated ("Tonight, as arguments fractured the community") but does not tighten on-page decisions. No clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices—she could conduct her transmission at any point during the ongoing conflict. The division is background context rather than a live temporal constraint that narrows options. Setup is present; development and closure participation are absent. The timeframe is ornamental, scoring in the functional-but-static band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is stated early ("Her motivation was singular: to outwit them") and drives her decision to transmit, satisfying setup and development. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction shows the cost of this desire versus, for example, professional caution or community loyalty. At closure the voice reframes the problem and Elara shifts to "propose unity," which pivots away from the outwitting goal rather than paying it off with cost. The element shapes one key turn but lacks visible trade-offs and closure integration, scoring in the low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Tone is asserted via the phrase "ethereal grit" in two separate lines ("The ethereal grit of the moment," "The ethereal grit of the night"), functioning as a label rather than an emergent quality of the prose. The story's actual tone blends expository summary with brief sensory detail (vibrating floor, static hiss) but does not modulate distinctly under pressure—Elara's interior voice remains steady from opening reflection through climax to resolution. The final image (stepping outside "ready to bridge the chasm") is declarative rather than charged by rhythmic or sensory shift. Tone is static and told, not demonstrated through cadence or imagery that evolves with stakes.</comment>
