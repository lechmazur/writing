<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is described through generic labels ("perceptively calm," "earnest whimsy") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her interior remains opaque; we witness no struggle between competing impulses, only a serene execution of her project. The community members never appear on the page as distinct individuals with their own agency—they exist as passive beneficiaries. The final "transformation" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict or visible cost to Elara herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure moment with legible cost. The mosaic unveiling and Elara's departure are told in summary across multiple paragraphs without a single crystallized image that reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the narrative proceeds through declarative summary rather than causally linked beats. The "collective healing" unfolds as a series of assertions ("pain had been transmuted," "hope, weaving through the ruins") with no on-page resistance, reversal, or felt price that would constitute Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins are established early and recur throughout, providing a consistent spatial anchor. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical resources that alter her approach. Sensory detail is present ("lavender's perfume," "sun warm her skin") but remains generic rather than POV-filtered through professional or personal priorities. The vines climbing motif is repeated rhythmically but does not pressure a decision or charge the final image with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collective healing through photographic curation—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elara's method succeeds without setback, adaptation, or visible cost; townsfolk arrive, view the mosaic, and are healed in a frictionless arc. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Agency is passive (collecting, arranging, unveiling) rather than decision under pressure. The resolution is declared rather than dramatized, with no on-page moment where Elara sacrifices, endures, or alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective healing emerges from the premise but is articulated through direct statement ("to transform loss into beauty," "collective healing was not an end") rather than image or implication. The arcs motif is over-explained ("every arc represented a shared moment") instead of allowed to resonate. The final paragraphs moralize the journey without ambiguity or counter-reading. "Earnest whimsy" is told as an attribute but not embodied in scene work or voice texture; the tone remains uniformly reverent and declarative throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance is uniform and detached throughout—no modulation with emotional intensity. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing ("subtle arcs," "laughter lines") is asserted rather than enacted through idiosyncratic diction or rhythm. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she saw," "she taught") stack in mid-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction cannot be assessed. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops pervade: "collective healing" appears nine times, "as vines climbed" eight times, "dove gray map case" five times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence dominates with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun], [appositive], [verb]" stems. Figurative language is strained ("arcs of smiles and shadows," "tapestry of connection") and repetitive. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content ("The subtle puzzle archivist had solved the greatest puzzle: how to heal together" echoes the premise without advancement). These artifacts touch the closure paragraphs, warranting the lower end of the artifact penalty range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist uses photographs to facilitate community healing after economic collapse—follows a familiar template (art-as-therapy, nature-reclaiming-industry) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "arcs" conceit is decorative rather than mechanically integral. Elara's success is frictionless, offering no fresh inflection or turn that grows from prior particulars. The lavender field, vines, and dove gray case feel like stock motif choices assembled to signal "literary" rather than organically synthesized. No bold risk-taking or transformation test passed; swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. She collects, arranges, and unveils without resistance or pivot. Observation dominates; agency is passive curatorial work rather than choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in beats 2, 11, 21, 32, 44, and 52, but its function remains static (container for photos/memories). It does not evolve in use or return with reweighted meaning at closure; the final mention ("now a symbol, rested in the museum") is told summary rather than charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Collective healing" is the thematic claim repeated throughout but never dramatized as a stake with competing options or on-page cost. It functions as label rather than a concept that shapes Elara's tactics or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears as a label in beats 3, 16, 30, 45 but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. It describes Elara's demeanor without creating friction, enabling a risky move, or foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Linger" recurs (beats 4, 13, 22, 34, 42) but remains ornamental—extended presence in the field without tactical consequence. Major turns (mosaic unveiling, community gathering) are not traced to lingering; the action could swap for "visit" or "work" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Arcs in black-and-white photographs" is the method, signaled early (beat 6) and mentioned throughout (beats 8, 14, 25, 33), but its mechanics are vague. We do not see Elara selecting, arranging, or struggling with the photographs on the page; the method is told rather than shown shaping her attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins are established early (beat 1) and recur consistently, providing spatial continuity. The setting enables gathering (beat 13) and the mosaic display (beat 25), participating in two beats and the ending. However, it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears as a rhythmic refrain (beats 5, 12, 19, 28, 36, 41, 45, 51, 53) but does not function as a tightening clock. Time remains vague and untracked; the vines' growth does not alter Elara's decisions or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated as motivation (beat 20) and echoed (beat 45), but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. Elara's desire proceeds without obstacle or internal contradiction; the motivation is told rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is claimed (beat 10, 24, 35, 49) but not enacted in diction, rhythm, or scene texture. The tone remains uniformly reverent and declarative throughout, with no modulation under pressure or playful inflection that would embody whimsy. The label does not charge the final image.</comment>
