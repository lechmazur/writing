<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's interior reveals urgency and technical focus ("logically emotional" appears twice as direct label-speak), but his emotional progression remains largely unembodied. The final choice—initiating sonic absolution—is motivated by established duty, yet the moments of adaptation and adjustment read more as technical problem-solving than contradictory impulse. The five pursuers never individuate beyond "dark shapes," reducing relationship pressure to abstract threat. Agency is present but the cost feels procedural rather than viscerally personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal, held cleanly to closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the arrival of pursuers, corroded oscillator bypass, and sonic seal form a legible chain of because/therefore escalation. Closure delivers a Decisive Change—the key is sealed, pursuers retreat—with visible cost: the artifact is now bound to this place, and Aris must wait for the proper vessel. One persistent constraint (the late supply cutter) shapes tactics and charges the final image. The cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, lighthouse tower, and resonance plate anchor spatial choreography cleanly throughout. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "ice choked with pale, shifting plates," "dust on the floor dance," the "low, profound C-sharp that vibrated in his molars." The setting supplies a live resource (the fog signal modification) that enables the climactic act. Micro-setting qualifies: the resonance plate and brass knobs constrain the final choice. The environment does not fully charge the final image, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the sacred artifact—is signaled in the opening and braided tightly with the timeframe pressure of the approaching sunset and pursuers. One meaningful tightening occurs when the corroded oscillator forces Aris to adapt his approach, narrowing options under live threat. The final sonic absolution delivers visible cost: the key is now bound to the marina, dispersing the pursuers but foreclosing portability. Agency is clear; the protagonist's decision alters tactics and the outcome. Escalation is driven by his choices under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—harmony between the solid and the unseen, sonic protection, absolution as cleansing vibration—emerges from action and image rather than direct statement. The key's glow, the ice calming, and the "profound peace" offer a resonant final image. However, phrases like "a forgiveness wrought not by words but by fundamental vibration" and "fleshly power of sound" edge toward abstract philosophizing. The final paragraph lands cleanly without overt moralizing, but the thematic resonance relies partly on repeated motifs (sound, light, solid/ethereal) without a non-literal reweighting that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is distinct and controlled: "skeletal pier," "humble fog signal," "tiny anchor in the vast ethereal night." Perceptual signature reflects Aris's technical focus ("calculating intervals") and emotional urgency. However, elevated register ("fleshly ethereal moment," "practitioners of sonic absolution," "absolving resonance") drifts from immediate sensory experience into abstract philosophical vocabulary, especially under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Internal voice is consistent but not singular enough to reach the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong; sentence rhythm varies purposefully and paragraph structure supports momentum. Information density is high in technical beats. However, pattern artifacts accumulate: "logically emotional" appears twice as a phrase-label; "azure coat" recurs three times without functional variation; "the key" and "the artifact" cycle synonymously across adjacent lines. Template cadence in the climax: "A tone emerged... It flowed out... The sound did not hurt..." Figurative density in the opening ("skeletal pier," "breath fogged materially," "fleshly ethereal") crowds without clear payoff. Deductions total approximately −1.2 for loops, synonym churn, and register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic technology, sacred artifact protection, and environmental threat is specific and non-obvious. "Sonic absolution" as a practiced art, the vibrational matching method, and the Old Sound Crypt housing "first harmonies" offer fresh inflection on familiar protect-the-artifact premises. Emotional truth in the final dispersal—"demanding inner silence"—feels earned. However, the core arc (engineer protects key from pursuers by performing a technical ritual under time pressure) follows a recognizable template; transformation arises more from world detail than from a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris shapes setup (opening), multiple middle beats (adaptation when the oscillator corrodes, dial adjustment, initiating the sequence), and the closure (sonic seal completes, pursuers retreat). His decisions narrow options and drive escalation under causal pressure. The azure coat recurs but does not constrain choice; the engineer role is irreplaceable and specific. Early signal, three distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost is procedural rather than deeply personal, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The key is introduced early ("lay heavy against his chest"), handled in the lamp room (placed on the resonance plate), and returns reweighted at closure ("glowed with a soft, absorbed light, now sonically sealed"). It appears in at least three beats and its transformation charges the final image. The object's unique properties—innate silent pulse, iron craftsmanship—matter causally. Visible cost: the key is now bound to the marina, altering future tactics. Strong integration with minor cost ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sonic absolution frames the protagonist's art in the opening, shapes his middle tactic (tuning the fog signal to match the key's frequency), and defines the climactic act (the cleansing tone that disperses pursuers). The concept changes options and tactics on the page, not merely echoed as theme. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. However, the mechanics are partly exposition-driven rather than dramatized through embodied struggle, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" appears twice as a direct label ("His mission was logically emotional"; "His fingers danced, logically emotional") without embodied tradeoff or visible cost. The trait does not constrain an on-page choice; it functions as narrative summary of his dual mode rather than a friction that alters action. Late first appearance (not until midpoint in the second instance). Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Adapt" is signaled early ("He had to adapt his plan"), drives the key middle turn (bypassing the corroded oscillator by routing current through the secondary crystal array), and reappears in reflection ("He had adapted to threat, time, and technology"). The action is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the escalation logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Three beats, early signal, and visible cost. The final reflection is slightly summary-only, preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is introduced early ("The method was vibrational matching"), shapes the protagonist's technical approach (seeking the key's fundamental C-sharp, achieving harmonic convergence), and enables the climactic sonic absolution. The mechanics matter causally: precision is required, error would crack the ice or shatter the key. Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, and closure linkage all present. The method is irreplaceable; the story logic depends on it. Strong integration with one hairline slip: the final reflection recounts rather than dramatizes the last use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is introduced in the opening, supplies spatial choreography and atmospheric pressure throughout, and its calmed state charges the final image ("the drift ice lay placid, absolved"). The setting provides a resource (the lighthouse and fog signal) that enables the climax. Early signal, causal involvement, and closure participation all present. The marina's unique properties (ice that grinds and must be pacified) matter to the stakes. However, the setting does not constrain a middle choice as directly as other elements; it functions more as backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is introduced early ("The sunset bled gold across the ice"), tightens pressure in the middle ("The golden light was fading faster now"), and its departure marks the closure window ("The golden light finally fled"). The timeframe pressures Aris's work and is tracked across beats. However, the clock does not alter a specific tactic or force a visible sacrifice; it functions as ambient urgency rather than a hard constraint that narrows options. Two gates (setup, closure), causal involvement, but middle development is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to protect the sacred artifact is introduced in the opening ("a duty born of reverence and cold necessity"), drives the middle beats (sonic seal to prevent misuse), and resolves at closure (artifact protected, pursuers dispersed). The desire is dramatized in choices: adapting the plan, bypassing the oscillator, initiating the sequence despite the approaching threat. Visible cost: the key is now bound to the marina, and Aris must wait. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Friction between reverence and urgency is stated more than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is introduced early ("This fleshly ethereal moment, where breath fogged materially while light died spectacularly") and recurs in the closure reflection ("a testament to the fleshly power of sound, a harmony between the solid and the unseen"). The tone—grounded physicality paired with abstract resonance—is coherent across beats and modulates appropriately with pressure (technical focus tightens during the climax, expands into reflection at the end). However, the tone is partly asserted through elevated diction rather than fully embodied in perception and action. Two-gate lyric reprise with thematic reweighting, but middle development is weaker.</comment>
