<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is present and her motivation clear, but her emotional arc relies heavily on abstract labels ("quiet revelation," "spirit unstrapped") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in action. The transformation from underachiever to custodian is declared more than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the laughing chime and kneeling gesture do some work, but peak beats default to conceptual summary. The final stance is legible but the path there feels more asserted than fought for under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the piece follows a single continuous scene in one POV. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: luminance density increases, mist-walking perception deepens, and the final custodian realization reweights the dominant stake (finding the sacred in the simple). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts her role as custodian, forecloses guild ambition). Cost is conceptual and felt—she trades guild relevance for solitary stewardship—but the final image ("Lyra sat within its glow, her spirit unstrapped and free") leans slightly toward assertion rather than an undeniable on-page gesture that makes the trade visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly anchored: white stone needle, perpetual twilight, thick ice windows, brilliant dimness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold moist presence, phantom ivy scent, cloud-sea below). The keystone—a carved garden folly scavenged from a ruined arch—constrains Lyra's final choice and charges the ending: she clears ice, dusts, sings, honoring the luminance. The setting is not mere backdrop; it cradles the soft impossibility and shapes her custodial stance. Micro-setting (hearthstone, tiles, windows) alters tactics and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra kneels and attempts mist walking "one last time," and the luminance responds, reweighting her understanding from failure to custodianship. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single decisive intensification: the glow swells, paints phantom ivy, and she begins to mend, each micro-choice (clearing ice, singing) narrowing her path away from the guild. Cost is present but oblique: she trades guild status for solitary stewardship, a conceptual price legible in the "underachiever"→"custodian" pivot, though the final image could make the foreclosed guild option more concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core theme—sacred simplicity versus automated efficiency—emerges organically from the keystone's "residue of joy" and Lyra's mending actions, not from thesis statements. The luminance as covenant, refusing streamlining, resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo: "a sacred simplicity that had been waiting in the dimness all along" and "a lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance" border on restating the premise rather than letting the image speak. The custodian realization offers a resonant answer, though it hovers near direct articulation of the theme rather than full embodiment in a charged action or object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Lyra notices guild protocols fading, senses stone ache and wind sigh—and diction mostly stays within her register. Under pressure (the mist-walking attempt), syntax tightens slightly ("She did not command it; she invited it"). However, elevated phrasing clusters in high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff: "brilliant dimness," "persistent, kind light," "covenant," "impossible reality," "quality" echo a poetic register that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page to assess. Brief filter-verb presence ("she felt," "she understood") is acceptable and legible, not stacked enough to trigger penalties.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high; spatial choreography tracks. Information density is good in the opening (guild context, spire setting, keystone origin). However, repetitive phrasing appears: "simple" recurs five times, "luminance" seven times, "brilliant dimness" twice, and conceptual paraphrase loops cluster in the resolution ("sacred in the simple she had sought," "sacred simplicity that had been waiting"). Template cadence: "She did not command it; she invited it. [...] she was no longer an underachiever. She was a custodian." The metaphor "lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance" at closure mixes vehicle (lighthouse above clouds) with an abstract tenor that dilutes specificity. These artifacts touch the final third, preventing 9+ eligibility and applying −0.8 in Q7 for loops and register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—underachieving mage finds meaning in simple, hand-cast magic versus guild automation—is recognizable but transformed through the garden folly keystone (specific, tactile, charged with residue of joy) and the icebound spire as crucible. The mist-walking method and custodian realization offer fresh inflections. However, the emotional arc (failure → solitary discovery → acceptance) maps closely to familiar templates without a bold structural or moral risk. The "automated age" versus "sacred simplicity" dichotomy is clear but leans toward a binary that the text does not complicate; the guild remains abstract antagonist, never tested on the page. Transformation is present but incremental; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet stops short of the non-obvious moral calculus or daring perspectival choice that would elevate originality into the high 7s or 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra (underachieving mage) is present throughout and makes two key choices: kneeling to attempt mist walking "one last time" (midpoint turn) and beginning to mend the spire (closure action). Her decisions alter tactics—she shifts from guild ambition to custodianship—and the final image shows her "sat within its glow, her spirit unstrapped and free," forecloses the guild path. Setup is immediate (opening line); development constrains the middle attempt; payoff shapes the ending. Cost is conceptual (guild relevance traded for solitary stewardship) but legible. Minor deduction for the custodian realization being slightly declared rather than fully dramatized through a charged action. All three gates met; two beats of causal pressure; closure linkage strong; cost visible but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The garden folly keystone is introduced early (paragraph two: "hearthstone, which was no simple rock but a carved garden folly keystone"), handled in ≥3 beats (she kneels and places palms on it; its warm pulse is felt; the vine's luminance flows; she traces the vine near the end), and charges the closure by anchoring the "covenant" that some wonders refuse streamlining. Its specific origin (scavenged from a ruined arch) and carved vine matter: the residue of joy from the folly's playful past enables Lyra's mist-walking and custodial stance. Setup early; development (warm pulse, luminance source); payoff (traced at the end, thematic anchor). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate (enables perception, not tactical constraint); closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high (the folly origin and vine carving are specific and load the theme). Cost tied to it is conceptual (the keystone holds what the guild cannot create).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lingering luminance (core concept) is signaled early ("a faint, warm pulse," "soft gold light clinging to the carved vine like a memory of sunlight") and shapes Lyra's perception and action across multiple beats: she invites it (not commands), it swells and paints phantom ivy, it thrives on her mending attention and grows "subtly brighter." The luminance is not merely thematic backdrop; it changes her options by revealing the icebound spire as "cradle for this soft impossibility" and enabling her custodial stance. Setup early; development (invitation, swelling, painting); payoff (companion in the quiet, present in final image). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate (enables perception and guides mending, but does not create a hard tactical constraint or fork); closure linkage solid (luminance lingers in final line). Cost tied to it: the luminance asks "nothing but to be remembered," and honoring it forecloses guild ambition. Swappability low (the residue-of-joy mechanics are specific).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" (attribute) appears twice as a label: "this place accommodated impossibilities" (mid-story) and "Lyra sat within its glow...accommodated at last" (final line). The concept frames the spire's function—it holds space for "magic that was not efficient, for beauty without function"—and shapes Lyra's understanding that her simple magic has worth. However, the attribute does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it remains conceptual shorthand rather than a tactical driver. Setup implicit (the spire's nature); development weak (label-only mention); payoff present (final line reprise reweights her stance). Two of three gates arguably met (setup + payoff via lyric reprise), but mid-development beat is absent. The attribute reweights the dominant stake (finding the sacred in the simple) but does not force a trade-off or alter her moves. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed→final reprise), lifting score into the mid-5s, but the lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unstrap" (action) appears twice: "attempting to unstrap her conscious mind from its rigid frameworks" (mist-walking attempt) and "her spirit unstrapped and free" (final line). The first use triggers the key turn—she successfully mist walks, perceives the keystone's luminance, and shifts tactics—so the action is causally central. The second use charges the closure image by bookending her liberation from guild protocols. Setup mid-story (~35% mark); development strong (enables mist walking and perception shift); payoff solid (final image). All three gates met; causal pressure high (unstrapping enables the entire mist-walking sequence and custodial realization); closure linkage strong. However, the action is metaphorical and internal rather than a concrete physical move, which reduces irreplaceability slightly (a near-synonym like "release" or "let go" could substitute with minor edits). Cost tied to it: unstrapping forecloses guild thinking, a conceptual price made visible in the custodian stance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mist walking (method) is seeded early (grandfather's stories, paragraph two) and signaled as Lyra's attempt: "she would try, one last time." Its mechanics matter: she seeks "deep quiet," unstaps her mind, and her "awareness seep[s] into the spire's stones," feeling ice ache, wind sigh, and the keystone's pulse. The method enables her to see the luminance and shapes her custodial tactics (mending, singing). Setup early (grandfather's stories, her prior failures); development strong (the attempt succeeds, reveals the luminance); payoff moderate (not explicitly named at the end, but the perceptual mode continues as she "spent uncounted hours in that luminous haze, learning its quiet language"). All three gates met; causal pressure solid (mist walking unlocks the luminance and the custodial path); closure linkage present but indirect (the mode persists, though not foregrounded in the final image). Irreplaceability moderate (the grandfather anchor and "spirit drift with mountain vapors" give it specificity). Cost: the method requires deep quiet and unstrapping, a renunciation of guild protocols.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire (setting) is present throughout: white stone needle, perpetual twilight, thick ice windows, brilliant dimness, hearthstone, tiles, cloud-sea below. It pressures Lyra's choice by offering solitude and a crucible for mist walking, and supplies the keystone that anchors the luminance. The spire's "brilliant dimness" and ice constrain her perception and guide her mending actions (clearing ice from a window, dusting ledges). Setup immediate (opening paragraph); development strong (the spire "was not a prison of ice, but a cradle for this soft impossibility"); payoff solid (the spire becomes "a lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance"). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate to strong (the spire's isolation and ice enable the mist-walking attempt and custodial stance); closure linkage strong (the spire is foregrounded in the final image). Irreplaceability high (the icebound, above-the-clouds, perpetual-twilight details are specific and load the theme). Cost: ascending to the spire forecloses guild engagement. Micro-setting (keystone, window, tiles) alters tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When creativity got automated" (timeframe) is present in the opening line and frames the guild's Artifice-Engines versus Lyra's hand-cast charms. The automated context motivates her isolation and search for the sacred in the simple. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it remains static backdrop rather than an urgent constraint. Lyra's time in the spire is "uncounted hours," and no deadline or escalating automation pressure forces her custodial choice. Setup immediate (opening clause); development absent (no mid-story escalation tied to automation's advance); payoff weak (the automated world below is mentioned at the end but does not drive the closure image). Two of three gates met (setup + oblique payoff); causal pressure low (frames motivation but does not narrow options or impose cost); closure linkage weak. The timeframe is swappable (a generic "modern world" or "changing age" could replace it with minor edits). Cost is conceptual (guild irrelevance) but not time-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—to find the sacred in the simple—is stated early ("Her motivation, long buried, was to find the sacred in the simple") and dramatized through her choices: kneeling at the keystone, inviting the luminance, mending the spire, singing old songs. The motivation is conflicted (guild protocols versus personal pursuit) and faces friction (her prior failures, the guild's dismissal as "sentimental dust"). The final realization ("Her motivation was fulfilled, not by finding a thing, but by recognizing a quality") closes the loop with felt cost: she trades guild achievement for solitary custodianship. Setup immediate; development strong (the mist-walking attempt and mending actions test her commitment); payoff solid (the custodian realization directly addresses the motivation). All three gates met; causal pressure strong (the motivation drives all key choices); closure linkage strong. Minor deduction for the final articulation being slightly over-explained ("Her motivation was fulfilled...") rather than fully embodied in image alone. Cost is visible (foreclosed guild path) and conceptual (acceptance of fragility, personality, "utterly hers").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" (tone) is named three times (opening atmosphere, mid-story deepening, implicit in the final "lighthouse" image) and establishes the spire's paradoxical light: weak sun through ice, soft glow, shadows as velvet, light as tender living thing. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: it starts quiet and chill, swells during the luminance sequence ("brilliant dimness...deepened"), and charges the ending ("lighthouse for a different kind of brilliance"). Setup early (paragraph one: "brilliant dimness, where the sun's weak glow diffused"); development solid (tone deepens as luminance appears); payoff strong (the final image sustains the soft-light-in-darkness paradox). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate (the tone reflects and supports Lyra's perceptual shift but does not constrain action); closure linkage strong (the paradoxical light anchors the custodial stance). Irreplaceability moderate (the phrase is specific but the effect could be evoked with synonyms like "gentle shadow" or "soft twilight"). Cost: the tone embodies the fragile, personal magic that refuses automation, a conceptual price made legible in the ending.</comment>
