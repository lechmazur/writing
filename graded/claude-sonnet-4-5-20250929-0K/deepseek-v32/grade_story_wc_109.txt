<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's obsession with mapping silence is present but never forces a meaningful choice or cost on the page. Her interior reads as contemplative narration rather than embodied pressure—no competing impulses, no visible struggle. The "mild obsession" is told ("mildly obsessed," "obsession had grown") but never dramatized through a foreclosed path or micro-choice that narrows options. The ending presents completion without resistance, making the arc feel illustrative rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered silence motifs, ambient tone). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (fort, ridge, oracle, star), so no Orientation Test penalty applies. However, no on-page closure effect is legible: the booklet is inscribed, then closed, with no visible cost, no option foreclosed, and no reweighting of prior stakes. The "completion" is asserted ("her completed work") but not dramatized as a before/after with felt price. Without a recognizable DC, RR, or CR, Q2 cannot enter the 7+ band, and cross-caps engage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort and ambered hush are vividly rendered and coherent across the piece. The fort's "wind-scarred walls" and the "marbled hush" layer sensory detail effectively. However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The 9+ gate (environment/tool constrains choice or charges closure) is unmet, capping this at 8.8 in principle, but texture and consistency earn mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the map of silence—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No reversal, complication, or meaningful pressure point appears; Elara works methodically without opposition or cost. The booklet "seemed to glow" is told atmosphere, not a turn. No choice narrows options, no visible price alters tactics. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break; here the tone remains static and the arc is linear completion without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of mapping darkness and finding meaning in silence emerges through imagery and Elara's task. The pebble-shore training and "tranquil shadows" offer texture. However, the final act asserts rather than dramatizes thematic resonance: "her silent wisdom etched into the pages" tells the theme directly. The ending does not offer a non-literal answer or reweight prior material; it summarizes completion. Mid-band for coherent motifs but no earned payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, controlled, and lyric throughout; diction ("ambered hush," "marbled quiet") is purposeful and maintains register. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, recurring syntactic patterns ("The … was …," "She …") create mild template cadence, and peak beats lean on atmospheric summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. No head-hopping, no POV leakage; solid mid-range execution with minor rhythmic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. "Ambered hush," "marbled hush," and "flaking gold leaf booklet" recur across beats, but repetition is pattern-taught rather than loop artifact. However, multiple adjacent sentences restate atmosphere without added pressure: "The ambered hush deepened as the sky darkened" / "In this ambered hush, time itself seemed to slow" is near-paraphrase (−0.2). Runs of "The … was …" and "She …" stems create template cadence in the middle third (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but not muddled. Total minor artifacts place this in upper-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mapping silence as geography is a fresh metaphorical premise. However, the oracle-at-ancient-fort frame and the gold-leaf-relic object are familiar fantasy motifs executed without fresh synthesis. The journey to complete a mystical task with no complication or cost reads as median safe execution. No bold structural risk, no transformation of tropes through lived conflict. Specificity in sensory texture elevates slightly, but the arc remains template-driven.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters stakes or tactics. Setup and development are met; she is named and her role frames the task. Closure participation is ornamental: she "stepped back" and "descended" without choice-driven consequence. Swappable with another contemplative oracle; no causal pressure tied to her agency. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6, no closure linkage caps at ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in paragraph 7, is opened and inscribed mid-story, then closed and "tucked away" at the end. Three distinct beats; setup, development, payoff all present. However, its properties (flaking, gilding peeling) are described but do not constrain or enable a choice—Elara inscribes without friction. Closure participation is passive (tucked away). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, but ornamental texture −0.6, swappability −0.5 (any relic booklet would serve). Lands mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" is named in paragraph 3, recurs as "marbled hush" and atmospheric motif, and frames the ending ("the marbled hush following her like a cloak"). Setup, development, payoff met. However, it never shapes a choice or tightens stakes—it remains mood rather than constraint. Lyric reprise reweights slightly at closure, lifting into lower-mid band. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.4 (mood only), but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Rounds to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is mentioned in paragraph 5 and paragraph 35, but only as label ("Her mild obsession had driven her to neglect sleep"). No on-page cost, no choice constrained or enabled by the trait. Setup met, development absent, closure mention is summary-only. Early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4, but label-only −0.6, summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5. Caps at ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Retell" is framed as Elara's purpose (paragraph 9, "to retell the ancient prophecy") and performed mid-story ("She retold the story of the void," paragraph 22). Two beats; setup and development met. However, the act of retelling is summarized rather than dramatized—we do not see the prophecy's content or its effect. No closure participation beyond assertion ("the weight of her retelling," paragraph 27). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, but summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5 (could swap "record" or "transcribe"). Functional but replaceable: ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is named in paragraph 10 and performed in paragraphs 12–15 (inscribing symbols for specific silences). Setup and development met; method is signaled and mechanics matter to the task. However, no cost or constraint emerges from this method—Elara inscribes without friction. Closure participation is passive (booklet closed). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, specificity +0.4 (symbols are particular), but ornamental mechanics −0.6, no closure constraint −0.4. Lands low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is named in the opening, recurs as spatial anchor, and is present at closure ("storm-tossed ridge fort would soon return to its wild state"). Setup, development, payoff met. However, it supplies atmosphere, not tactical constraint—the fort's proximity to sky (paragraph 33) is told rather than dramatized as choice-shaping. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, but ornamental setting −0.8, swappability −0.6 (any isolated high place would serve). Mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When only one star remains in a dimming sky" opens the piece, recurs in paragraph 20 ("the single star a lonely beacon"), and closes ("the one star winked out"). Setup and payoff met, but development is absent—no mid-story tightening tied to the star's presence. Time does not pressure a choice; the star is ambient marker. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5 (final image), but ornamental use −0.7, no middle pressure −0.5, swappability −0.5. Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is named in paragraph 5, drives Elara's task throughout, and frames closure ("a map for all time"). Setup, development, payoff met. However, the desire is told and methodically pursued without internal conflict or competing want. No friction between cost and goal appears on the page. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only desire −0.7, no friction −0.6. Functional but not dramatized: ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" is introduced in paragraph 11, recurs across beats (paragraphs 22, 34, 40), and envelops Elara at closure ("the marbled hush following her like a cloak"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (calm to deepening quiet). Setup, development, payoff all met. However, tone remains static mood rather than pressure-responsive modulation. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, coherence +0.4, but single static mood −0.6, ornamental use −0.5. Upper-5s.</comment>
