<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Chronicle Keeper is presented with a consistent trait ("grips reality loosely") and a declared motivation ("to witness change without judgment"), but these remain largely label-only. No on-page micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses or force trade-offs; the Keeper moves through ritualized actions without visible internal conflict or cost. The piece summarizes a state of being rather than dramatizing a character under pressure making decisions that foreclose paths. Interiority is abstract and declarative ("Their motivation held firm") rather than embodied in specific perception or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear before/after closure is legible on the page. The Keeper enters the hut, experiences "regenerative silence," journeys through the origami swan's folds back into the library, then returns to the hut—completing a circular ritual without visible cost, altered options, or a decisive reweighting of stakes. The piece reads as a descriptive loop rather than a causal or accumulative arc with meaningful tightening. The stated "crumbling peace" and "drift of untold seasons" are asserted repeatedly but never tested or transformed by an on-page event or choice. Orientation is delayed; who and where remain vague past 120 words, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure (apply −0.4). Cap per Orientation Test: Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian hut are vividly textured with moss, vines, stone, and a gray river, and the origami swan is handled across multiple beats. However, these elements function as backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. The swan serves as a transport device without mechanical consequence; the library's decay is described but does not pressure the Keeper's decisions. Spatial choreography is loose (the Keeper is "both in the hut and within the library's core" without clear transition mechanics), and the descriptive density occasionally stalls momentum rather than propelling it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A dominant stake is never clearly signaled. The Keeper seeks "regenerative silence," but this desire faces no opposition, complication, or cost. The journey through the swan's folds and the return to the hut unfold without reversal, tightening, or a choice that forecloses an option. Coincidence does not complicate; instead, the Keeper executes a practiced ritual without error or friction. No on-page escalation or deepening changes the character's knowledge, options, or emotional state. The piece declares witnessing "change without judgment" but never dramatizes a moment where judgment or refusal would carry a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than earned: "to witness change without judgment," "crumbling peace," and "regenerative silence" are stated repeatedly without a non-literal image or event that reweights them. The ending folds the swan and readies "the next descent," resetting to the beginning without offering a resonant answer to a dramatized question. Subtext is absent; every meaning is declared on the surface. The piece leans on prompt labels ("drift of untold seasons," "grips reality loosely") as substitutes for specific, embodied insight. No epiphany arises from concrete struggle; instead, the narrator tells us the Keeper has found "a testament to the regenerative silence."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent lyric-mythic register ("catacombs of lost knowledge," "the drift of untold seasons") that fits the concept. However, diction becomes repetitive and abstract: "grips reality loosely," "crumbling peace," "regenerative silence," and "drift of untold seasons" recur without variation or payoff. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the Keeper's way of noticing lacks idiosyncratic detail. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains distant throughout, never modulating with emotional intensity because no emotional intensity is dramatized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "crumbling peace" appears three times, "drift of untold seasons" four times, "grips reality loosely" twice, "witness change without judgment" three times, all without added pressure or detail (apply −0.8 for pervasive loops). Figurative language is frequent but often mixed or contradictory: "crumbling softly like ancient parchment" vs. "crumble of peace become a gentle, healing decay"; "time bled like sap" vs. "time as a layered tapestry." Sentence openings are repetitive: "The Keeper," "Their," "This," "To witness" recur in mechanical succession. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a keeper of knowledge who journeys between a library and a refuge via origami—offers a surface novelty, but the execution leans heavily on familiar mystical-library and regenerative-silence tropes without transformation. The Keeper's ritual is described but never tested; no turn or reweighting arises from character choice. The piece assembles symbolic objects (swan, obsidian hut, overgrown library) in a way that reads checklist-driven rather than organic. Emotional truth is absent; the narrative asserts a state of witnessing and renewal without dramatizing friction, cost, or specific human complexity. The transformation test fails: swap names and objects, and the plot (ritual → journey → return) remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The Chronicle Keeper is present throughout, but their actions are observational and ritualized rather than decision-driven. No key turn traces to a choice the Keeper makes under pressure; the journey through the swan and return to the hut proceed without complication or cost. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent (cap 3.4). Swappability is high; the character could be replaced with "the wanderer" or "the meditator" with minor edits (−0.6). Apply ornamental-use deduction (−0.5) and late-appearance minor friction (−0.0, character is present early). Total adjustments: 3.4 cap, −1.1 cumulative = 2.3, rounded down to 2.4 within allowable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears early (setup ✓) and is revisited at the end (closure participation ✓), but it does not constrain a middle choice (missing development → cap 3.4). The hut provides "regenerative silence" but this quality is described rather than tested; the Keeper sits, experiences it, and leaves without friction or visible cost tied specifically to the hut. Swappability is moderate; "stone shelter" or "quiet cave" could replace it (−0.6). Two-beat involvement (+0.9) and early signal (+0.5) are present. Causal pressure is minimal (−0.0, capped by missing middle gate). Lyric reprise is present but does not reweight a stake with cost. Total: 3.4 cap + 0.9 + 0.5 − 0.6 = 4.2, but lyric allowance may raise to 4.8 within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named repeatedly and described as "actively replenish[ing]," but it never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present (all gates ✓, eligible ≥6.1), but the concept remains ornamental: the Keeper seeks it, receives it, and departs unchanged. No cost or tradeoff is tied to the silence; it functions as backdrop rather than stake-driver. Swappability is high (−0.6); "healing stillness" or "restorative peace" would serve identically. Causal pressure is absent (−1.0). Total: base 6.0 − 1.6 cumulative = 4.4, rounded to 4.4. Re-check: ornamental use (−0.8) better captures the lack of action pressure. Total: 6.0 − 0.8 − 0.6 = 4.6, adjust to 3.2 for summary-only integration (−0.8) and no middle beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no choice or perception hinges on loose vs. tight grip. Setup is present; development and closure participation are absent (cap 2.8). Swappability is extreme (−0.8): remove the phrase and nothing changes. Apply label-only deduction (−0.3) and ornamental use (−0.5). Total: 2.8 cap − 1.6 cumulative = 1.2, raised slightly for early mention to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears in setup, middle, and closure (all gates ✓, eligible ≥6.1). The action is named in multiple beats: "burrow into the library's heart," "burrow through its cryptic folds," "forever burrowing into silence." However, it remains metaphorical and summary-only; no specific mechanics or cost are dramatized. Swappability is moderate (−0.6): "delve," "sink," or "descend" could replace with minor edits. No causal pressure or visible tradeoff (−0.8). Beat involvement across three mentions (+1.4) and early signal (+0.5) are present. Total: 6.0 + 1.4 + 0.5 − 1.4 cumulative = 6.5, reduced to 4.3 for summary-only execution (−0.8) and lack of irreplaceability cost (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced early (setup ✓), handled in the middle journey (development ✓), and folded again at the end (closure ✓). It appears in at least three beats (+1.4), is signaled early (+0.5), and its "cryptic folds" are described as the method for transition. However, the mechanics remain vague and ornamental; the swan enables travel without cost, complication, or specificity. Swappability is moderate (−0.6): a "worn talisman" or "ancient key" would serve identically. Causal pressure is minimal; the swan functions as a magic pass rather than a choice-shaping tool. Total: 6.0 + 1.4 + 0.5 − 0.6 − 0.5 (ornamental) = 6.8, reduced to 5.2 for lack of irreplaceability and no on-page cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The overgrown library appears in setup, is the destination of the middle journey (development ✓), and is invoked at closure (all gates ✓). It is vividly textured (moss, vines, stone shelves) and present across multiple beats (+1.4). Early signal is strong (+0.7). However, the library does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as a destination rather than a constraint. Swappability is low; the specific details matter to atmosphere. Causal pressure is absent (−0.5). Total: 6.0 + 1.4 + 0.7 − 0.5 = 7.6, reduced to 5.9 for lack of on-page cost and ornamental role (postcard description trends low per rubric).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears four times but never tightens a decision or shapes a tactic. Time is vague and untracked; no clock or deadline alters the Keeper's moves. Setup and closure participation are present via repetition, but middle development is absent (cap 3.4). Swappability is high (−0.6); "through endless ages" or "over long years" would serve identically. Apply label-only deduction (−0.3) and ornamental use (−0.5). Total: 3.4 − 1.4 cumulative = 2.0, raised slightly for lyric recurrence to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated three times and functions as the Keeper's declared motivation. Setup and closure participation are present; development is label-only rather than tested by a choice (missing functional middle gate → cap 3.4). The motivation is never dramatized in friction or cost; no moment forces the Keeper to resist judgment or pay a price for witnessing. Swappability is high (−0.6); "to observe with detachment" would be identical. Apply told-only deduction (−0.8). Total: 3.4 − 1.4 cumulative = 2.0, raised to 3.7 for lyric persistence and closure reprise that acknowledges (but does not reweight) the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" appears three times and the prose maintains a consistent lyric-mythic tone: slow, meditative, decay-as-renewal. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present (all gates ✓, eligible ≥6.1). However, the tone does not modulate with pressure because no pressure exists; it remains static across all beats. The final image repeats rather than charges the tone. Coherence is strong (+0.8), but lack of modulation and single static mood (−0.8) and failure to charge the final image (−0.5) apply. Total: 6.0 + 0.8 − 1.3 cumulative = 5.5, reduced to 4.7 for missing cost linkage and ornamental closure mention.</comment>
