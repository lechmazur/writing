<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's interior voice contains some specificity ("consciously wild," serene anger), but his motivation to "discover why time slows in crisis" remains abstract and declarative rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His decision to "undergo his own disappearance" at the end lacks grounding in prior causal pressure—no on-page choice forces this outcome; it reads as announced fate. The final act forecloses no visible path with felt cost because the stakes remain conceptual throughout. Embodiment is present in moments (pale skin tingling, breath held) but emotional progression stays smooth and label-reliant ("serene anger") without the hypocrisy or self-deception that would charge the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (ink patterns dissolve, discovery accrues through observation). Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by line four). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael gains insight and commits to vanish—but the cost is asserted rather than made undeniable on the page: "to truly grasp the phenomenon, he must now undergo his own disappearance" tells us price without showing forfeited option or altered tactic. The insight ("consciousness expanded to capture more detail") arrives as epiphany, not causal consequence of prior pressure. No meaningful tightening between midpoint and end; the ink fades, he smiles, packs, and leaves in a sequence that feels and-then rather than because/therefore even under accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, eclipse coolness, and flat rock provide clear spatial grounding and contribute atmosphere. The artificial hummingbird's hum and the ink's pulsing labyrinth shape are vivid. However, setting remains largely postcard: stone shelters, horizon, breeze do not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics. The journal and drone are handled, satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but neither imposes friction—Kael retrieves the drone without struggle, and the wind "carving new shapes" at the end is decorative rather than pressure-bearing. Sensory detail is present but filtered through tourist catalog ("wind-howled," "fading light") rather than POV-specific professional or survival priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (discover why time slows), but the story never tests this want with a genuine obstacle or trade-off. The ink patterns coalesce and vanish on schedule; Kael observes, records, smiles. No reversal or tightening: coincidence (the ink forming a labyrinth) delivers the insight without protagonist agency, and his final choice to "step into the fading light" is announced, not forced by prior narrowing of options. The cost ("he must now undergo his own disappearance") is declared but not dramatized—no on-page forfeiture of tool, time, safety, or relationship. Escalation flatlines after the ink fades; packing the journal and walking away carry no visible price or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>A theme of perception-expansion under crisis emerges from the ink-pattern conceit and Kael's quest, and the final image of vanishing "through ephemeral patterns" attempts non-literal resonance. However, the climactic insight ("consciousness expanded to capture more detail, a survival mechanism") is stated as epiphany rather than earned through specific struggle. "Serene anger" recurs but remains a label without contradiction or cost. The ending's thematic answer—Kael must disappear to understand disappearance—gestures toward complexity but arrives without prior friction or ambiguity to reweight. Subtext is thin; most meaning is overt (journal in disappearing ink, "he had his answer"). No motif gains pressure across beats; the ink and drone are used once each without accumulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction has some texture ("wind-carved," "consciously wild," "serene anger"), though phrases like "ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" repeat mechanically and "as if obeying a silent command" drifts into stock cadence. Psychic distance is consistent, slightly elevated, which suits the reflective mode but flattens urgency at the peak (ink vanishing). Perceptual signature is present—Kael's focus on time dilation, his tracker's patience—but does not modulate under the moment's supposed intensity. No dialogue to evaluate. Elision is purposeful (we skip how he built the drone), but the final paragraph's looped phrasing ("began to disappear, through ephemeral patterns") re-asserts rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; grammar clean. Rhythm varies somewhat, though several paragraphs open with "The" or "He" in adjacent sentences, creating mild template cadence. Information density is uneven: the second paragraph (stone walls hold shadows, Kael at the edge, white hair lifts, red eyes scan) cycles through postcard details without advancing pressure. The phrase "disappearance through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" recurs four times nearly verbatim (including title echo), constituting paraphrase loop and synonym churn that dulls the closure image. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt as though," "knew he too would soon disappear") cluster in the climax, reducing immediacy. Figurative language is restrained and mostly clear, though "shadows like memories" and "drum of serene anger" trend stock. Propulsion sags in the middle third as reflection dominates without micro-choices. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs, and −0.3 for filter stacks in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The combination of albino tracker, disappearing-ink journal, and artificial hummingbird drone offers surface novelty, but the emotional and thematic arc (lone researcher gains insight, must sacrifice self to knowledge) follows a familiar template without transformation. The ink-pattern mechanism is visually specific yet remains ornamental—removing it and substituting another vanishing phenomenon (sandstorm, mirage) would leave plot and theme unchanged. "Serene anger" as oxymoron feels forced rather than earned through contradictory action. Kael's final step into disappearance lacks the inevitability that marks fresh synthesis; it reads as prompt fulfillment. Proximity check: "time itself stretched," "the world seemed to hold its breath" echo crisis-slowdown clichés without fresh angle. No bold structural risk; the story proceeds linearly from setup to announced conclusion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael (albino tracker) is present throughout and makes the final choice to "step into the fading light," but his decisions do not create key turns—he observes the ink, records it, then announces he will vanish. His albinism (pale skin, white hair, red eyes) is mentioned but does not constrain or enable action; "tracker" skill is declared (practiced patience) but never applied to a problem. Swappable with "researcher" or "scientist" with minor edits. Meets setup and closure-mention gates but lacks middle development pressure. Cap at 3.8 for swappability. Band guidance: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone is introduced early (setup), used once to record the ink patterns (middle beat), and retrieved at the end (closure mention). Its mechanics (tiny cameras, sensors, wing hum) are specific, and it captures data that "would remain" as testament. However, it does not constrain or enable a choice—Kael uses it passively, and no friction (battery, malfunction, retrieval difficulty) alters tactics. Two beats (recording, retrieval) + closure mention earn ~5.0–5.5 range; lack of causal pressure and no visible cost tied to the device keep it mid-band. Lyric reprise (early → final) without middle struggle trends 5.5; here the middle use is present but static, so 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the journal's medium, signaled early and returned at closure as metaphor ("ephemeral patterns"). It does not shape stakes or tactics—Kael does not race the fade, struggle to preserve it, or adjust his method when it vanishes. The ink's disappearance is observed, not acted upon. Thematic echo is strong, but Q9C asks whether the concept changes options on the page; here it does not. Meets setup and closure-mention gates; missing middle development cap would be 3.4, but the thematic charge and two-mention reprise lift slightly to 4.2. Still well below causal-work threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is defined early ("embracing instinct while retaining reason") and attributed to survival success, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It remains label-only: no moment where instinct conflicts with reason, forcing a trade-off. The trait could be cut without altering any beat. Ornamental use, late first functional claim (if any), and no visible tradeoff place it in 0.1–2.9 range. Mentioned twice (intro, final paragraph) but purely decorative. 2.6 for presence across bookends without mechanical impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action "disappear" is signaled early (disappearing ink, Kael's quest topic), developed in the middle (ink vanishes, time stretches), and executed at closure (Kael steps away to vanish). It redefines the story's logic: understanding requires personal disappearance, turning observation into participation. Removing "disappear" would break thematic coherence and final image. Three gates met; causal linkage and closure participation earn 6.0+; irreplaceability and cost (Kael forfeits continued presence) push toward 6.3. Not higher because the vanishing is announced rather than forced by prior pressure, and the cost is declared ("demanded a price") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method "through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" is explained early, demonstrated in the middle (ink coalesces into labyrinth, then fades), and recurs at closure ("began to disappear, through ephemeral patterns"). Its mechanics matter narratively—the patterns teach Kael about time dilation—and it is irreplaceable (no generic "vanishing" would carry the same specificity). Three gates met; two beats (ink observation, final metaphor) + closure linkage + causal role (insight triggers) earn mid-5s. Not higher because Kael does not attempt different tactics with the ink or struggle against its fade; observation is passive. 5.8 for solid integration without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is introduced in the opening line (setup) and mentioned at closure ("final look at the wind-carved encampment"). It provides atmosphere but does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome—Kael could conduct his experiment anywhere flat and quiet. The stone shelters, horizon, and breeze are postcard anchors. Two-gate presence (setup, closure mention) without middle development caps at ~4.6 per gate model; lack of causal pressure or tactical relevance keeps it replaceable, so 3.9. Spatial choreography is clear but static.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ended" anchors the opening and is mentioned once more ("returning sun"). Time does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock, no urgency tied to daylight or eclipse effects. The eclipse serves as scenic marker, not pressure. Single mention (setup only) without middle or closure participation; missing two gates caps below 3.0. Vague and untracked; could be removed with one-line edit. 2.3 for setup presence without mechanical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to discover why time slows in crisis" is stated early and restated at closure ("he had his answer"). It frames his actions (journaling, using the drone) and is thematically central. However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing want, no moment where cost forces him to choose between discovery and safety. The insight arrives via observation, not hard choice. Three gates met (setup, middle framing, closure), but lack of conflicted choice or visible trade-off limits integration to mid-band. 4.8 for functional motivation without on-page struggle or cost that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is introduced early ("simmered beneath his calm exterior"), restated midpoint ("smiled with serene anger"), and returned at closure ("drum of serene anger against the dying day"). Tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure, no breakdown or intensification at the ink's vanishing. The oxymoron is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory action (e.g., violent patience, controlled rage). Three-gate presence and purposeful reprise earn 4.0+; lack of charged modulation or final-image intensification keeps it functional but mid-band. 4.5 for consistent tone without pressure-driven transformation.</comment>
