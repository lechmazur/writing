<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arrin's motivation is clearly established and his actions remain consistent—speaking dead languages to seeds, interpreting bird calls, performing the final ritual. The character demonstrates competence without struggle; his climactic choice (emptying all seed pods) feels more like executing a revealed procedure than wrestling with contradiction or cost. Interiority leans toward poetic description rather than embodied tension under pressure. The final act forecloses his collection but the weight of that loss isn't dramatized through hesitation or conflicting impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (jetty, primroses, birds, submerged pillar) building to a cadence shift when Arrin scatters the seeds over the glowing treaty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the garden's expansion and birdsong-as-hymn reweight the opening stake with conceptual cost (his entire collection sacrificed). One meaningful deepening occurs when the birds' agitation reveals the hidden treaty pillar, narrowing Arrin's tactics to the final ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Arrin follows bird guidance to its very end where the treaty pillar is wedged, forcing the ritual at that exact location. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cracked boots sinking into peat, phosphorescent swirl in water, biotic glow of runes. The blooming primroses and toxic sea establish a narrow oasis of life against ruin, and the spatial choreography from jetty's inland edge to its stone terminus drives the final beat. The treaty pillar charges the closure image by making the garden's expansion causally dependent on its presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reclaim the battlefield through beauty. The birds' agitation introduces a meaningful tightening—they direct Arrin to the failing treaty pillar, which narrows his options to one ritual sacrifice. The choice to empty his entire collection carries visible cost (his only cargo, his reason for being) and the consequence (new shoots marching inland) appears on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient: discovery of the submerged concord reweights what fertilization means and the final scattering forecloses the path of incremental planting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: covenant between land and sea, memory as fertilizer, beauty as counter-force to war's ruin. The submerged treaty pillar grounds the abstraction in a concrete object whose glow intensifies when fed the essence of growth. Arrin's use of a dead liturgical tongue to chant the treaty over ground seeds layers language, ritual, and ecology without overt moralizing. The final image—birdsongs turning into hymns, shoots pushing inland—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether a garden can reclaim a battlefield, reweighting the narrow jetty into vast potential without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; narrative distance remains consistent and apt for the lyric-accumulative mode. Diction is elevated and voice-particular ("narrow vastness," "monument of narrow vastness," "gloom-hill coachman") with purposeful compression that the piece teaches early. Some lines approach overwriting ("His motivation was simple, a quiet crusade") but the elevated register remains coherent under the established tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—Arrin notices ecological detail, ritual gesture, avian intelligence—and the prose rhythm modulates purposefully from meditative observation to charged ritual action in the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or action. Figurative language is dense ("finger of stubborn life," "monument of narrow vastness," "coax life from the dead") and while purposeful, approaches saturation in the opening paragraph without clear pattern-teaching that would justify such concentration. A paraphrase loop appears: "His motivation was simple, a quiet crusade: to let a garden reclaim a battlefield" closely restates the prior sentence's intent. Template cadence surfaces in "he would fertilize...he would stand...he would then take" scaffold phrasing. No major loops obscure causality, but the elevated diction in peak beats occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-war ecology, dead languages as ritual fertilizer, and bird-call interpretation offers a fresh angle. The submerged treaty pillar as a biotic source transforms the "reclaiming nature" trope through specific world logic (coral-formed covenant, rune-glow leeching). The piece commits fully to its lyric-ecological premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in elevated diction and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars (treaty pillar, seed-pod collection, liturgical chant, bird guidance) and would collapse with generic substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arrin is introduced in the opening line, his nightly routine established early (setup). He makes the middle decision to follow bird guidance to the jetty's end (development), and performs the climactic ritual scattering that enables closure (payoff). His choice to empty his entire collection—his only cargo and reason for being—narrows options and carries visible cost. The causal chain is clear: his interpretive skill surfaces the problem, his collection provides the solution, his ritual enacts the change. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seed pods appear in paragraph two (setup), are handled during the nightly planting ritual (development), and become the substance of the climactic offering (payoff). Their evolving use drives escalation: from incremental planting tool to entire collection sacrificed in one ritual. The final scattering over the treaty pillar reweights their meaning from cargo to covenant-fuel. Specificity matters—dried, rattling husks from skeletal forests ground them in the post-war ecology. Irreplaceability is high; the treaty needs "the memory of growth, the essence of the land it was sworn to protect," which the seeds uniquely provide.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The submerged concord (treaty pillar) is discovered mid-story but its presence explains why life clings to the jetty, retroactively shaping all prior action. It appears at the climax and drives the final ritual—Arrin must feed it the seed essence to restore its power. The pillar's failing glow creates the immediate problem that narrows tactics. Its carved runes and biotic light make it irreplaceable; no generic object could substitute. The concept shapes stakes (mutual care between land and sea) and tactics (ritual offering rather than soil planting) with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dead languages are introduced in paragraph two (setup) and used in the climactic chant over the seeds (payoff). The attribute enables the final ritual—"using a dead liturgical tongue, he chanted the words of the treaty"—suggesting the match between language and treaty is necessary. However, the constraint is not tested; we don't see Arrin struggle to recall the correct tongue or choose among them. The trait appears in two beats but its mechanics (how speaking dead languages "coax life from the dead") remain assertion rather than demonstrated cost or tradeoff. Mid-band for presence and closure link, but swappability remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fertilization is established as Arrin's nightly method (setup), demonstrated through bird-guided soil amendment (development), and transformed in the climax when he fertilizes the treaty pillar rather than soil (payoff). The action's reweighting is decisive: the birds reveal that the true fertilizer was always the treaty's leeching, and Arrin's final act feeds the source rather than the symptom. The ritual scattering over the glowing pillar drives the garden's inland expansion. Irreplaceability is high—this exact action shift (soil to water, incremental to totality) creates the closure effect. Three-beat involvement with strong causal pressure and closure centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bird-call interpretation is introduced in paragraph three (setup), demonstrated as Arrin translates finch and warbler calls to diagnose soil (development), and delivers the key intelligence in the climax—"Tonight, the birds were agitated. Their calls were not about the soil, but about the water" (payoff). The method shapes the middle turn (discovering the treaty pillar) and enables the final ritual by revealing what the pillar needs. Specificity matters: the avian intelligence is irreplaceable as the mechanism that surfaces the hidden problem. Strong causal role across three beats, though the exact mechanics (how calls indicate salts or failing covenants) remain somewhat loose.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is anchored in the opening paragraph (setup) and its spatial structure drives action: Arrin walks its length, the birds guide him to "the jetty's very end," and the treaty pillar is "wedged in the jetty's pilings" (development and payoff). The setting's narrow geography forces the climactic ritual at the exact spot where pillar meets stone. Its contrast (vibrant finger vs. toxic sea, battlefield reclaimed) charges the thematic closure. Micro-setting function is strong—the jetty's physical extent and the primroses' boundary constrain Arrin's movement and reveal the hidden covenant. Environment shapes tactics and final image with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the reef died" anchors the timeframe in the opening line (setup) and establishes the post-war present. Twilight recurs as the ritual window ("every twilight," "as the sky purpled") creating a temporal rhythm. However, the timeframe operates as backdrop rather than tightening pressure; no live clock forces Arrin's choice, and the treaty's slow failure is described but not counted down. The past war shapes motivation and the reef's death enables the skeletal seed collection, but elapsed time doesn't alter tactics. Functional context without escalation pressure; lyric reprise in "twilight flocks" but no cost tied to temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to let a garden reclaim a battlefield is stated in paragraph one (setup), demonstrated through nightly planting (development), and tested in the climax when Arrin must sacrifice his entire collection to fulfill it (payoff). The final choice dramatizes the friction between incremental method and totality: he empties his only cargo, his reason for being, to feed the covenant. The cost is visible—no more seeds to plant—and the payoff (shoots marching inland, reclamation becoming vast) validates the trade. Desire is embodied in repeated action and the peak choice forecloses the former path. Strong causal involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Narrow vastness is named explicitly ("a monument of narrow vastness") and enacted through contrasts: tiny jetty against endless ruin, single coachman against vast battlefield, a finger of life pointing into toxic sea. Tone modulates purposefully—meditative observation ("impossibly still, his head tilted") tightens into charged ritual action ("a slow, ritual circle"). The phrase recurs in closure: "The narrow vastness held its breath" before the garden's expansion begins. Coherent through turns and the final image delivers on the promised scale shift (narrow to vast) with undeniable pressure. Distinct perceptual texture (lyric compression, elevated diction) charges the ending without static mood.</comment>
