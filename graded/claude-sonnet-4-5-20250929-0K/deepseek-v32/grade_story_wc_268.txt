<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Oren's motivation is clear and his initial choices—grinding the ink pellet, inscribing the rune—show purposeful agency under pressure. However, his interior remains largely observational and descriptive; contradictory impulses are absent, and the final confrontation is entirely passive (he watches the pretender self-destruct). The pretender's weeping feels asserted rather than embodied, and the "shock of his own smallness" edges toward diagnostic label-speak without visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal chain: cryptic messages → Oren's preparation → placement during celestial pause → pretender's reading triggers collapse. Orientation anchors (who, where) land early. The closure—pretender unmasked, illusion collapsed—occurs on the page with visible cost (the man weeps, flees). One meaningful pressure point (the rune's effect) reweights the stakes. Cost is legible in the pretender's humiliation and flight, satisfying the Drive Lens (Causal with lyric texture).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The temple library is vividly rendered through sensory specifics: "scent of vellum," "dust in slanted light," "starlight mist." The folio on royal lineages and the ink pellet constrain Oren's tactical choices. The celestial pause provides both atmospheric and temporal pressure. Spatial choreography (stacks, shadows, towering shelf) remains clear, and the library's "sigh" at resolution charges the final image without overstatement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender to protect the True Name—is signaled early and drives all action. One meaningful tightening occurs when Oren places the inscribed page and the pretender consumes it, narrowing options to the rune's effect. The resolution is earned by Oren's agency (preparation, timing, placement) and the pretender's choice to speak the rune. Visible cost: the pretender's persona unravels, he flees hollow, and Oren burns the evidence, foreclosing future use.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth as erosive force, illusion's fragility—emerges from concrete action: the rune of drift unravels false certainty without force. The iron gall ink and starlight mist return at the end, charged with meaning: truth "needed no monument." The final image—dust descending through ancient starlight—reconfigures the opening's stillness into earned resolution. No overt moralizing; the particulars (ink, rune, breath) invite reflection without explaining the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited on Oren; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("regally unpretentious grace," "acidic tang the smell of consequence") that fits the temple-guardian idiom. However, the diction occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction ("celestial inhalation," "quiet sunder") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The pretender's brief interiority ("trembling, ambitious clerk") is cleanly dramatized without filter clutter, but the overall perceptual signature lacks the biased selectivity that would anchor 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense in key beats (ink preparation, rune inscription). However, figurative language saturates many sentences without always advancing pressure: "frost," "ash in soft wind," "graceful collapse" recur as motifs but occasionally blur into ornament. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("regally unpretentious" appears twice; "graceful collapse" in both title beat and ending). The final image—dust in ancient starlight—is evocative but the surrounding sentence is overlong. No major artifacts touch closure, capping penalty at ~−0.8 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—guardian uses a dissolution rune rather than force to unmask a pretender—offers a fresh inflection on the "knowledge guardian" archetype. The rune of drift (inviting unraveling) and the specific ritual (starlight-ground ink on mist parchment) are non-obvious and feel earned. The ending's quiet destruction of evidence avoids triumph-clichés. Yet the emotional arc (wise guardian defeats foolish pretender) follows a familiar template, and the pretender remains one-note ambitious. Transformation is present but not radical; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Oren (diminutive titan) is present throughout and his choices—grinding ink, inscribing the rune, placing the page, burning it—create key turns. His physical paradox (small hands lifting stone tablets) is mentioned early but does not constrain action; his stature contrasts with the pretender's "borrowed stature" at closure, reweighting the trait. Two beats (preparation, closure) show agency, but middle development is observational. Fits but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet is introduced early, handled in the grinding ritual, and its properties (acidic tang, potent black) matter to the rune's creation. It reappears implicitly when Oren breathes upon the inscribed page and the ink unravels into smoke. Two beats (preparation, destruction) involve it; its specific form (pellet, dense sphere) is noted but not mechanically essential—liquid ink could serve. Causal presence is strong but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rune of drift shapes stakes and tactics: Oren chooses dissolution over force, the pretender mistakes it for the True Name, and its effect (unraveling illusion) drives the climax. The concept appears in three beats (inscription, pretender's reading, collapse) and the final image (ink drifting into smoke) echoes it. Without this exact rune, the pretender's defeat would require force or conventional unmasking, breaking the story's thematic and tactical logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is introduced early and mentioned again at closure ("regally unpretentious vigil"). The trait contrasts with the pretender's "stolen glory" and shapes Oren's method (quiet truth over spectacle). However, it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it remains largely descriptive. The closure reprise reweights it slightly, but no action hinges on this exact attribute. Lyric resonance but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears in Oren's plan ("sunder the pretender's claim") and at the collapse ("quiet sunder echoed through the hall"). The action is metaphoric—unraveling rather than breaking—and the climax enacts it. The pretender's persona is sundered stitch by stitch. However, "unravel" or "dissolve" could replace it with minor edits; the specificity is thematic but not mechanically unique. Two beats and closure linkage, but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cryptic messages left in library books incite the conflict, shape Oren's detection work, and dictate his reply method (planting the rune in the same book type the seeker defiled). Three beats: discovery, plan, placement. The method's mechanics (altered glyph in margin, probes in treaties and primers) are specific and the seeker's return to the folio is causally motivated. Removing this method would require a face-to-face confrontation, fundamentally altering structure and tone.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient temple library lost in time provides resources (folio on royal lineages, collected starlight), constrains movement (silent stacks, towering shelf for hiding), and supplies atmosphere that charges the closure ("library itself seemed to sigh"). The setting's timelessness justifies the celestial pause and the final image (light from a star centuries old). Present in four beats (inciting discovery, preparation, trap, resolution) and integral to tone. Swapping for a mundane archive would strip thematic resonance and tactical texture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" is introduced as Oren's waiting period and the celestial inhalation when identities grow fluid. The timeframe enables the trap (vulnerability in the fabric of the world) and is referenced at closure (dust descending through ancient starlight). However, the pause itself is vague—no ticking clock or on-page tracking of its passage. Two beats (setup, use) but minimal tactical pressure; lyric function stronger than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Oren's motivation—to unmask the pretender and protect the True Name—is dramatized in his detection, preparation, and trap. It drives three beats and the resolution directly enacts it (pretender unmasked, flees). The motivation crystallizes "like frost" when he finds the messages, a concrete moment. However, internal conflict is absent; Oren never doubts or weighs competing goods. The goal is pursued without friction or cost to him personally, lowering integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is the title beat and governing tone: the rune invites dissolution, the pretender's majesty drifts apart "like ash in soft wind," the ink unravels, dust descends. The tone modulates from stillness (opening library peace) through preparation's quiet intensity to the collapse's elegiac finality. It appears in four moments (rune concept, pretender's fall, ink's end, dust image) and charges the closure without melodrama. Removing this exact tone—substituting violence or triumph—would gut thematic and emotional coherence.</comment>
