<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her trait "wilts near dishonesty" is stated multiple times, but the embodiment remains mostly label-driven rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action. The ending choice to distribute truth is causally earned, though the journey reads more as quest-completion than internal transformation with visible cost. Interiority often tells emotional state ("her hands shook," "feeling the weight") rather than rendering perception under pressure. The guard moment briefly dramatizes her honesty trait, but most beats summarize her reactions to deceit rather than staging conflicted micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal lens: Elara finds map fragments, assembles them, follows the route, discovers the council's water diversion, and distributes proof. Orientation anchors (greenhouse city, toxic sky, calligrapher) arrive early. However, the closure—distributing copies and the city "beginning to heal"—is summarized rather than dramatized, and the cost (her risk, potential retaliation) is asserted ("She did not wilt now") but not viscerally shown on the page. The causal chain is legible, but the final beat lacks the immediacy and felt consequence required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is established early and recurs (glass domes, overgrown sectors, vines cracking glass, humid corridors). The zinc plates and studio details are specific. However, much of the setting functions as backdrop; the map's physical mechanics (how fragments click together, how she navigates ducts) are summarized rather than felt as constraints that alter her path. The setting charges the premise but does not force tactical choices at key beats, keeping it functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go and exposing the council's lie—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara discovers the council diverted water, which shifts her goal from recovery to revelation. The guard encounter provides a brief micro-reversal (honesty lets her pass), and her final act (distributing the truth) is protagonist-driven. Yet the escalation is mostly linear: each beat adds information without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs until the end, and the resolution's cost (her risk, the city's response) is told rather than shown in a charged moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deceit emerges through Elara's quest and the council's lie. The final paragraph borders on moralizing: "candor in small moments could rebuild what dishonesty had broken" and "They go to those who listen with honesty" state the theme directly rather than letting the image resonate. The zinc fragment as reminder and the gilded leaves as vehicle are purposeful, but the ending explains meaning instead of offering a non-literal image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, focalized on Elara. Perceptual signature is present (calligrapher's attention to letters, her physical wilting), and the voice maintains a consistent lyric-fabulist register. The single line of dialogue ("the truth") is clean but minimal. Some filter verbs ("She found," "She understood") are acceptable given the voice, though they occasionally dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose texture is consistent and purposeful, with no major slips in stance or tense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and advances the plot, but several paragraphs loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "She reread the assembled map, noting a route" is followed shortly by "Elara reread the inscriptions, hearing echoes"; "candor in small moments" is stated three times across the story. Template cadence is mild ("She followed," "She found," "She worked," "She distributed") but does not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; many lines do one job. No major figurative muddle or register drift, but the sentence-level propulsion is even rather than modulated to scene pressure, and some key beats (assembling the map, distributing copies) are compressed into summary where dramatization would sharpen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-city-under-toxic-sky and zinc-postal-plate details are vivid and specific, and the calligrapher protagonist is a fresh angle. However, the quest structure (find map, follow map, discover villain's deceit, reveal truth, city heals) is a familiar template, and the ending's moral clarity—truth triumphs, city begins to heal—leans toward tidy resolution without complication. The emotional arc is straightforward: Elara wilts under lies, finds truth, gains strength. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the template through unexpected calculus or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's decisions drive all major beats: she seeks the repository, pieces the map, ventures into the city, confronts the guard with truth, discovers the council's deceit, and distributes the revelation. Her choices create the turns, and the final act (etching and distributing the truth) is causally hers. She appears in every beat and her agency is clear, though some beats summarize her actions rather than dramatizing them.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zinc postal plate fragment is introduced early (under floorboards), handled and assembled in multiple beats (piecing together, matching to core plate, carrying as proof, kept on her desk at end). It returns with reweighted meaning: initially a treasure map, it becomes proof of council deceit and a tool for distributing truth. The object is causally active across setup, middle discovery, and closure participation, making it essential to the plot's mechanics and the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Candor in small moments" is named three times and thematically present (Elara's honesty with the guard, her commitment to truth), but it functions more as theme label than on-page constraint that shapes tactics. The concept does not visibly narrow her options or force a trade-off; she consistently chooses honesty without cost until the ending asserts its importance. It colors the stakes but does not actively change the plot's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The trait "wilts near dishonesty" is stated multiple times (council lies, traders' deceit, discovery of diversion) and briefly eases with the guard's honesty. However, the wilting is mostly label-only: "Elara wilts," "her strength ebbing," "wilted at this dishonesty." One on-page moment—passing the guard—shows the trait enabling action, but elsewhere it is asserted rather than shown through embodied cost or tactical constraint. The trait is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reread" appears twice: once when she rereads the assembled map to note the route, and again when she rereads the inscriptions in the chamber, hearing lost voices. The second instance leads to the discovery of the core plate and the council's deceit, a major turn. At the end, she rereads her own words to ensure truth, framing her new purpose. The action is causally present in key beats and shapes her understanding, though it could be replaced with "examined" or "studied" in some instances without full structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards—is introduced early and its mechanics matter: each fragment fits with a click, revealing streets and ducts. The assembly enables the middle journey and discovery. However, the actual piecing is compressed into two sentences without tension or failed attempts; the map is found, assembled, and followed in linear fashion. The method shapes the plot's structure but is not leveraged for escalation or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is established early, recurs (glass domes, vines, overgrown sectors, humid corridors), and frames the stakes (water rationing, council deceit). The setting provides the postal network infrastructure and the forgotten dome where plates are stored. However, the environment rarely constrains Elara's choices on the page; she navigates without spatial or social friction beyond the single guard. The setting charges atmosphere and stakes but does not force tactical alterations at key beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the oasis dried" is named as the inciting condition and repeated near the end, framing the world's crisis. Water rationing affects Elara's pigments and sustains urgency. However, time itself is not tracked as a live pressure; Elara's journey unfolds without deadline or clock. The timeframe sets context but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics beat-to-beat; it is a static backdrop rather than an escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to find where lost conversations go" is stated early, drives her quest (seeking the repository, following the map, discovering the chamber), and is fulfilled at the end: "she found where lost conversations go." The motivation frames the plot and is dramatized through action. However, there is little friction between this want and competing costs; she pursues it in a straight line without internal conflict or sacrifice until the ending shift to distributing truth. The desire is clear and causal but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
