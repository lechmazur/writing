<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to restore music to a silent world—but her interior life reads as poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction. The "symphonically minded" trait is labeled repeatedly without constraining a choice or forcing a trade-off; she succeeds at every step without visible friction. Emotional states are described ("longing," "resolve") but not enacted through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The closure—grove singing again—feels declared rather than earned through a final difficult micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who, where, and when anchor by the opening lines. The dominant stake (restore music) is signaled early, and the lens reads as accumulative/textural—Elara's work with stress cracks, porcelain insulator, and trees builds toward a tonal shift. However, the closure effect lacks visible or felt cost; the grove simply begins to sing after her strumming, and no path is foreclosed or reweighted with pressure. The final image ("empathy in motion had turned silence into symphony") summarizes theme rather than dramatizing a decisive reconfiguration, landing as conceptual claim without undeniable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove, petrified sculpture, and porcelain insulator are vivid and purposeful, grounding the textural accumulation. Spatial choreography is clear across Elara's movements from sculpture to living trees. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the grove does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure. The insulator is handled in multiple beats and shapes the final action (strumming), which lifts the score into the mid-6s, but the environment itself remains passive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (create music) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Elara's methodical work—analyzing cracks, strumming the insulator, connecting trees—but escalation reads as steady addition rather than a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; she proceeds unimpeded from sculpture to grove to success. The closure does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible price, so the final turn lacks the cost clarity required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (empathy, listening, restoration) emerges from Elara's actions and the image of stress cracks holding "the notation of the tree's past song." However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly: "empathy in motion had turned silence into symphony," "her symphonically minded plan had come to fruition," and "empathy in motion" recurs as a label rather than resonating through image. The hedgehog uncurling is a purposeful motif that seeds vulnerability-into-action, but the ending moralizes ("by understanding the stress cracks, she had found the path to harmony") rather than offering a non-literal answer through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (symphonic, textural). Diction is elevated and purposeful, with phrases like "dread quiet" and "nascent sound" establishing a lyric register. However, peak beats recycle stems: "She moved… She strummed… She remembered… She continued…" across the final third, flattening rhythm. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("feeling their stories," "weaving the snippets") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than artifacts. The voice is distinct but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; images are specific (petrified alder, porcelain insulator, siskin birds). However, paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "empathy in motion" appears four times in eight paragraphs, and adjacent sentences restate content ("She worked tirelessly… She remembered the hedgehog… She continued to strum"). Template cadence dominates the last page ("Elara [verb], for…" / "She [verb], the [object]…"). Mixed metaphor: "stress cracks, like musical staves, held the notation" conflates visual (cracks) and symbolic (staves) without coherent vehicle. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for loops and cadence runs that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—using stress analysis and a porcelain insulator to awaken tree-song—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "artist restores beauty" trope through tactile method and unusual materials. The hedgehog uncurling as vulnerability-into-action seed is a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (longing → methodical work → success) follows a predictable template without complication or risk. The final third hedges risk by over-explaining thematic coherence ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded plan") rather than trusting image and action. Solid originality in premise; safe execution in closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (approach sculpture, analyze cracks, strum insulator, move to trees) drive all beats. She appears in the opening paragraph (setup), her analysis and strumming shape the middle (development), and she is active in the final image (payoff). However, her choices do not meaningfully narrow options or face friction; she succeeds at each step. The closure would remain intact if the protagonist were a different artist with the same skill set. Causal work is present but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator is introduced in the first third ("from her pocket, she drew…"), handled in two distinct beats (sculpture analysis, tree strumming), and present in the closure image ("glowing with a soft light as it channeled the grove's reawakened song"). Its unique property—conducting vibration into cracks—enables the key action. However, another resonant object (tuning fork, glass rod) could replace it with minor edits; the closure depends on the strumming action more than this specific material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is labeled six times but rarely constrains a choice or alters tactics. The concept frames Elara's approach (touch as understanding, translating intention into vibration) but operates primarily as thematic echo rather than on-page friction. The phrase appears in the closure paragraph, but its function is summary ("empathy in motion had turned silence into symphony") rather than a pressure point that changes options. Functional but replaceable with "attunement" or "resonant listening."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is mentioned four times, describing Elara's perception ("hearing not just notes but entire movements," "weaving the snippets into a possible melody," "her symphonically minded vision," "her symphonically minded plan"). The trait is label-only; it does not constrain an action or force a visible trade-off. A sculptor with any other perceptual mode (spatially minded, texturally minded) could execute the same plot. Present in setup and payoff, but no middle development or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strumming appears in the first third ("she began to strum its rounded surface"), drives two distinct beats (sculpture analysis → tree awakening), and is the active verb in the closure ("She continued to strum… the grove's reawakened song"). The action is irreplaceable; tapping, pressing, or touching would not generate the same vibration-based method. Major turns trace to this action. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; a visible cost (sustained effort) is implied but not made explicit on the page, preventing entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the first third ("by analyzing stress cracks…"), executed in the middle ("she understood where the sculpture had held tension and where it had fractured"), and credited at closure ("by understanding the stress cracks, she had found the path to harmony"). Two beats: sculpture analysis and application to living trees. The mechanics matter (cracks as "musical staves" holding "notation"), though the leap from analysis to tree-awakening is asserted rather than dramatized. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named in the opening line, anchors all action (setup), and is present in the closure ("In the siskin alder grove, empathy in motion had turned silence into symphony"). Each tree functions as an instrument in the middle beats (development). However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters tactics; it serves as stage rather than pressure. The grove's "intensely quiet atmosphere" is atmospheric but passive. Lyric reprise at closure reweights the silence-to-song shift, lifting into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" is introduced in the first third as Elara's self-imposed marker ("the work would begin anew"), recurs in the final third ("After the hedgehog uncurls, she had thought, and now, after its uncurling, the grove sang"), and appears in the opening-scene observation ("she had watched the small creature unfurl"). The timeframe is symbolic rather than a live clock; no ticking pressure or deadline alters Elara's tactics. Setup and payoff are present, but no middle development or cost tied to waiting. Late first appearance of the phrase itself (middle of first third) and swappability (any seasonal marker) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to create music in a silent world" is stated in the third paragraph, drives every beat (analyzing cracks, strumming trees), and is satisfied at closure ("the silent world was silent no more"). Setup, development, and payoff are clear. However, the desire is told ("her motivation was singular") rather than dramatized through friction or competing wants. Elara's longing faces no internal conflict or visible cost; she pursues the goal unimpeded and succeeds. Functional and causal, but replaceable with any restorative ambition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is named in the opening third ("In the siskin alder grove, silence had become absolute," "intensely quiet atmosphere") and recurs at closure ("The intensely quiet tone of the world had been transformed into a quiet that was full, rich, and alive"). The tone is coherent across all beats and modulates purposefully: silence → faint harmonics → whisper → layered harmony. The final image charges the tonal shift (silence reweighted as fullness). However, the tone does not pressure a choice; it describes atmosphere rather than constraining tactics. Strong lyric reprise and coherence lift into mid-6s.</comment>
