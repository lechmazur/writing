<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide travelers is present but operates largely through competence rather than internal contradiction. Her "reluctant caretaker" stance is told in the opening but never tested on the page—she executes the rescue with practiced efficiency, and the "stubborn ember" and "quiet peace" feel asserted rather than earned through visible struggle. The micro-choices (placing the nut, arranging pebbles, humming) demonstrate skill but lack meaningful cost or foreclosed alternatives that would deepen characterization. Embodiment is thin; emotional states are described ("grim," "reluctance") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (orchard, labyrinth, Elara, nightfall deadline). Drive lens reads Situational: Elara must guide travelers before frost seals the paths, using environmental cues within a fixed constraint. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—her duty shifts from burden to "map she was slowly learning to read"—but the felt cost is minimal; she simply completes the task and returns to the orchard with no visible forfeiture or changed option set. The sequence is coherent and legible, but the ending reweights her stance through assertion ("strange peace assemble within her") rather than a dramatized price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth, mechanical birds, orchard, and night frost create a vivid, purposeful setting. The nut's grooves, crevice placement for shadow-casting, and the polished quartz reflecting light all constrain Elara's tactics and enable the rescue. Spatial choreography is clear (entry passage, dead-end, shortcut wall), and the frost's arrival frames urgency. The micro-setting (nut in crevice, slate vibration, light on bird's breast) charges the final sequence, satisfying the 9+ test by making environment indispensable to the closure action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: guide travelers to safety before frost seals the labyrinth. The deadline tightens pressure, and Elara's environmental manipulations (shadow, pebbles, sound, light) constitute tactical escalation under Situational lens. However, the travelers are passive recipients with no agency, and Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle or forced trade-off—each step succeeds as planned. The cost is time and urgency rather than a live forfeiture; no option is visibly foreclosed. Escalation reads as competent execution rather than a choice that narrows her path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance, duty, and guardianship emerges through Elara's relationship to her grandfather's lost blueprint and the orchard's whispers. The ending offers a shift from reluctance to peace, a quiet answer to the burden-versus-calling question, but it lands through assertion ("felt like a map she was slowly learning to read") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior particulars. The nut and blueprint motifs recur but function primarily as plot devices; their thematic charge is stated rather than earned. Subtext operates in the mechanical birds' "approval," but the final paragraph edges toward moralizing with "a strange peace assemble within her."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Voice has texture ("offhandedly exact," "graceless beauty" refrain, "stubborn ember") but repeats template cadence in several beats: "She did not lead them by hand; instead, she let the impressions work." Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices grooves, shadows, patrol gaps—but does not degrade or shift under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonic leys," "Conceptual Repricing") that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue dysfunction; the single spoken line is functional. Elision is purposeful (we see only key manipulations), but the rhythm flattens under peak stress rather than sharpening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and moves purposefully, but several patterned artifacts appear: "This was her first impression" / "This, too, was an impression" loops the concept; "offhandedly exact" and "graceless beauty" recur as refrain without evolving pressure. Template cadence runs: "She moved quickly... She gathered pebbles... She recalled more." Figurative language is heavy in non-peak beats ("stubborn ember," "crystalline threads," "harmonic leys") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or action, but scaffold phrasing ("Her motivation, a stubborn ember") and summary-tell ("The orchard's whispers seemed softer") reduce momentum. No showstopping opacity, but loops and cadence runs trigger −0.6 deduction and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, forgotten blueprint, and "leaving impressions without touching" is specific and purposeful. The blueprint-as-tactile-memory and the shadow/sound/light manipulations feel particular to this story. However, the rescue proceeds without surprise or ironic reversal; each tool works as designed, and the travelers' passivity flattens engagement. The "reluctant caretaker finds peace in duty" arc is familiar, and the ending's "strange peace" shift is told rather than transformed through a non-obvious choice. Emotional specificity is moderate; the piece reads competent but safe, avoiding bold risk that might heighten stakes or complicate the protagonist's success.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes multiple choices (placing nut, arranging pebbles, humming, reflecting light) that shape the rescue. Setup is immediate; middle and closure participation are strong. However, her "reluctant" trait is stated in the opening and resolved in the ending without on-page friction—she never hesitates or pays a visible cost for her caretaking. The choices are competent executions rather than agonized decisions that alter her path. Two gates (setup, closure participation via final reflection) are met; development is functional but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nut appears in four beats: Elara plucks it, reads the blueprint's impression in its grooves, places it in a crevice to cast a guiding shadow, and it remains "wedged in the stone" at closure. Setup is early; it enables a key tactic (shadow arrow) and recurs in the final image with reweighted meaning ("a tiny key to a forgotten design" / "now part of her own"). All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate (one tactic depends on it), and specificity is high (grooved surface, shadow-casting). Closure linkage is present but passive (it sits wedged). Strong integration, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blueprint frames the entire rescue: Elara recalls her grandfather's design, reads it in the nut's grooves, and uses its patterns (pebbles mimicking sequences, birds' patrol gaps, harmonic leys) to guide travelers. Setup is immediate; development shapes tactics across multiple beats; closure references it ("the blueprint's heart, still beating"). All three gates met. However, the blueprint itself is never in tension—it simply works as remembered—and could be swapped for "grandfather's map" or "her training" without structural loss. Causal pressure is moderate; the stakes arise from the frost and travelers, not from uncertainty about the blueprint's validity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" appears as a descriptor for Elara's gesture (plucking the nut) and the mechanical birds' movements. It recurs in the final third ("her offhandedly exact guardianship") but functions as tonal label rather than constraint—Elara's actions are precise and casual, yet this trait does not visibly limit or enable a choice that another trait would foreclose. Setup is present; middle use is descriptive; closure use is thematic echo. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this specific attribute. Swappable with "effortlessly precise" or "practiced."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Assemble" recurs across beats: Elara assembles a path for stranded souls, arranges pebbles in sequences, assembles the final guide from landscape elements (quartz reflection → bird clicks → wall shift), and "a strange peace assemble within her, piece by piece." Setup is immediate (method stated early); development spans multiple tactics; closure reprises the verb with emotional charge. All three gates met; causal pressure is strong (the rescue depends on assembling cues), and specificity is high (the verb ties micro-actions to theme). However, the action itself could be replaced by "construct" or "build" with minor edits; the thematic resonance elevates it but does not make it structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is stated early ("leaving impressions without touching") and governs every tactic: shadow from nut, pebble patterns, hummed vibration, reflected light. Setup is clear; development spans four beats; closure references it ("guide the lost without touching them"). All three gates met. Causal pressure is strong—this constraint shapes each attempt and distinguishes Elara's approach from direct intervention. Specificity is high; removing this exact method would collapse the tactical logic. Cost is minimal (the method works smoothly), preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth and mechanical birds are present throughout: patrol patterns create threat, grooves and crevices enable shadow/sound tactics, the birds' wings trace safe routes, a wall section shifts to reveal shortcut, and the final image returns to brass wings under moonlight. Setup is immediate; development constrains and enables multiple choices; closure grounds the final tableau. All three gates met. Causal pressure is strong (setting shapes every tactic), specificity is high (mechanical birds, patrol gaps, harmonic leys), and irreplaceability is evident—the rescue depends on this exact environment. One minor slip: spatial choreography is occasionally vague (where exactly is the dead-end relative to the shortcut?).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The frost deadline is stated early ("before the night frost formed, its icy touch sealing the labyrinth's paths") and tracked across beats: "The air grew colder," "The first crystalline threads of night frost began to weave," "Before the night frost fully formed." Setup is clear; development tightens urgency; closure shows frost arriving as travelers escape. All three gates met. However, the clock is marked by atmospheric cues rather than tactical pressure—Elara never adjusts her plan due to diminishing time, and the frost's arrival feels simultaneous with success rather than a narrowly avoided consequence. Functional but lacks bite.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated early ("to guide lost travelers to safety") and drives every action. Setup is immediate; development spans the rescue; closure reflects on duty as fulfillment. All three gates met. However, the desire is never conflicted—Elara acts from "stubborn ember" competence without hesitation, and no friction between this goal and another want (self-preservation, rest, doubt) appears on the page. The cost is effort and time, not a foreclosed alternative. Told motivation executed cleanly but without dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" recurs five times: mechanical birds' "graceless beauty in their precise, ominous circuits," Elara's "graceless yet effective" movements, "a graceless beauty etched into the cliffside forever," describing the labyrinth as "ugly and awkward, yet profoundly right—a graceless beauty." Setup is immediate; the phrase modulates slightly across beats; closure reprises it in the final third. The tone is coherent and charges the setting, but the exact phrase becomes predictable through repetition. Tone supports theme (functional elegance in imperfection) but reads as imposed descriptor rather than emergent quality. All three gates met; tonal contribution is strong but not indispensable.</comment>
