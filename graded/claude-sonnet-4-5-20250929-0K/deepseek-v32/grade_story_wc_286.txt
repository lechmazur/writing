<comment>Kael's interiority is specific and embodied ("breathing as measured as the wheel he no longer turned"), and his calm presence drives the final action. However, the core choice—placing and wiping the glass—lacks internal contradiction or cost; he executes with zen confidence rather than struggle. The final renunciation (returning the glass) reads as gentle closure but doesn't foreclose a live competing want with visible sacrifice. Backstory about pottery anchors voice but doesn't tilt a present micro-choice.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pattern (sun observation, glass visions, thrum) and delivers a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the oasis "had already integrated every possible ending." The cost is conceptual—Kael's understanding reweights the premise—but the emotional or opportunity price remains oblique. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (potter, oasis, wasteland). One meaningful deepening occurs when the thrum forces reconciliation of timelines, and the final image recharges the opening question.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The oasis grounds who/where/when early; sensory details (heavy air, thrum in teeth, warm glass) are selective and serve pressure. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the choice to align it with sun and charging the final image when it clears to reflect his face. Spatial choreography (stone, hive box, gate) tracks cleanly. The wasteland and date palms frame the stakes without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: understanding why the oasis resists change. The glass-alignment action narrows options by forcing calm (aggression would shatter the vision), and the thrum escalates into a tightening reconciliation. However, the resolution is delivered more through revelation than protagonist cost; Kael's steady breath and wipe succeed without a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative. One meaningful deepening occurs when the timelines knit, but the felt price at closure is light.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "constant, gentle reconciliation" and "centering clay" anchor the concept without moralizing. The final image—glass returned, air lighter, "gentleness within him had a newly sharpened edge"—reweights the opening question with resonance. The oasis-as-clay metaphor integrates organically. Minor slip: "sharp gentleness" is articulated in text ("This was the sharp gentleness of the place") rather than left fully implicit, nudging toward thematic echo.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature (potter's lens: "centering clay," "poorly fired glaze"). Diction remains character-consistent; no head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows cleanly during the glass-vision beat. Minor texture issue: a few phrases lean slightly elevated ("phototropic to kindness," "consuming hunger") but remain legible within the contemplative register. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong; no filter-verb stacks or voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong specificity ("light glowing through its cells," "cracking along unseen seams"). Information density is high; most lines advance image or pressure. Minor loop: "abandoned" appears twice in opening lines, and "gentle/gentleness" recurs frequently (five instances) without always adding pressure. "Phototropic to kindness" is abstract/labeled rather than shown through micro-action. No major scaffold or template cadence, but figurative density ("fractured timelines," "bleeding chaos," "sharpened edge") clusters without always earning metaphoric coherence.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—potter's craft applied to temporal reconciliation in a failed oasis—is specific and memorable. The "phototropic to kindness" concept is fresh but leans abstract; grounding it in one more micro-action (not just calm presence) would sharpen necessity. The ending image (returning the glass as offering) avoids tidy moralizing. Risk: the accumulative structure and lyric tone commit fully, though the contemplative mode stays comfortably within genre expectations for magical realism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Kael is present throughout; his potter identity anchors the metaphor ("centering clay") and his calm demeanor enables the timeline reconciliation. His decision to wipe the glass with breath and return it to the hive shapes two beats and the closure image. However, the choices feel observational more than high-stakes turning points; a zen observer could be swapped with minor rewrites. Cost tied to his specific trait is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The faded lantern glass is found (beat 1), aligned and wiped (beat 2), warms and clears (beat 3), and returned as offering (closure). Its cloudiness-to-clarity shift reweights meaning, and the discovery in a hive box ties to beekeeping setting. Removing it would collapse the vision mechanism and final image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fractured timelines shape the glass-vision beat, constrain tactics (calm required to settle layers), and anchor the conceptual repricing at closure ("holding all its versions at once"). The thrum is the sound of timelines straining. Removing the concept would break the oasis's resistance logic and the reconciliation mechanism. Present early, drives middle pressure, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is stated as the oasis's attribute and constrains one action (calm breath and wipe vs. aggression). However, it's more told than shown; we don't see a contrasting attempt or a visible cost tied to choosing kindness over another impulse. The label arrives mid-story and functions thematically more than tactically. Swappable with "responds to calm" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The thrum appears when the glass is placed, deepens as timelines strain, and mellows into a hum at reconciliation—three beats. It signals escalation and marks closure success. Removing it would weaken the sensory escalation and the felt shift to peace. Present in setup, development, and payoff; specific (vibration in teeth, sound of straining) and tied to cost (chaos vs. harmony).</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Following sun patterns" is signaled early (charting light's crawl, noting noon shadows) and determines the timing ("the timeframe he had learned to watch for") and the glass-alignment action. However, the sun-charting itself doesn't constrain a difficult choice or create visible friction; it's preparatory rather than pressure-driving. Middle development is thin; it enables the peak beat but doesn't shape a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis supplies the hive box (glass source), the placement stone (alignment surface), and the date palms (stubborn shade). The setting's dual state—whole/barren in visions—drives the fractured-timeline concept and the reconciliation stakes. Scorched wasteland frames existential threat. Removing the beekeeping specifics would break the honeycomb image, the keeper's repair action, and the offering return. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" marks the heavy-air moment when Kael acts, and smoke diffusing signals timeline-knitting. However, the timeframe is more atmospheric cue than pressure mechanism; no visible clock tightens his decision or raises cost if he delays. Present in setup and closure participation, but doesn't constrain tactics. Swappable with "at dusk" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Kael's motivation—"to understand why some places resist change"—is stated early, drives his sun-charting method, and is answered at closure ("it encompassed all change"). The discovery alters his stance (walking back with "newly sharpened edge"). However, the want is intellectual rather than conflicted with a competing need; no visible sacrifice dramatizes the cost of seeking understanding. Strong thematic tie but light friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>"Sharp gentleness" is embodied in Kael's breath-and-wipe action, the oasis's tender will that "could cut through linear time," and the final "gentleness within him had a newly sharpened edge." Tone is coherent through turns—calm under pressure, then resolved peace. It modulates with the thrum's escalation and charges the closure image. Minor deduction: the phrase is articulated in text rather than left fully implicit, but the tonal consistency and payoff are strong.</comment>
