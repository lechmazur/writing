<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal state is conveyed through metaphor ("furiously tranquil," "calm surface over a deep, raging sea") rather than embodied action and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The closure choice—writing a single pristine line—feels thematically motivated but lacks prior dramatized struggle between competing wants; the shift from "dense, angry verses" to "pristine line" is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Backstory (photography, censorship, lost love) is presented as summary rather than anchored to present stimuli that tilt current stance. Interiority relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("furiously tranquil," "understand the cartography of scars") that no one has mid-crisis, triggering the label-speak penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the storm, timer, envelope, and map accumulate toward the final realization. Orientation anchors who (Elara, censored poet) and where (observatory) early, but "when" remains vague beyond "storm's peak." The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara writes a new line and places it in the envelope, reweighting her scars as "channels for light." Cost is implied conceptually (self-censorship ended) but not viscerally felt on the page; we don't see what she risks or forfeits by descending with this poem. The timer's ring and storm's zenith provide cadence shift, but the tightening feels mechanical rather than causally motivated by her struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vivid and purposeful: lightning illuminates the dome, the telescope points at veiled stars, the glass reflects Elara's image at a pivotal moment. The darkroom timer and envelope are handled as concrete objects that anchor the present. Spatial choreography is clear (spiral stair, console, glass dome). The observatory functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—"not for looking out, but for looking in"—constraining her vigil and reflection. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the storm metaphor, though the setting does not alter her tactics or supply resources that affect outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to escape censorship and "understand the cartography of scars." The timer counts down to the storm's peak, providing a structural tightening, but no reversal or choice narrows her options; the timer simply rings and she writes. The envelope's cryptic line and map complicate her arrival but do not force a trade-off. Agency at closure is a decision (writing the new line) but the cost is conceptual and not viscerally felt; we don't see what she forfeits or risks by descending with this poem. Pressure coheres thematically under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate through protagonist choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—scars as maps, silence as speech, censorship as contour—emerges from image and metaphor rather than direct statement. The final line "scars as channels for light, silence as a form of speech" offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on prompt-like phrasing ("cartography of scars," "furiously tranquil," "vigil in pause") that borders on thematic echo. The observatory-as-mirror and darkroom-as-insight metaphors are clear but somewhat on-the-nose. Subtext operates in the envelope's hidden message and the reflection in glass, though epiphany arrives without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Elara's perception. Diction is elevated and lyric ("storm-kissed wonder," "rarefy her thoughts") but remains consistent; no mid-crisis register shifts. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the cartography of scars, both on the land and within the soul") that sounds more like authorial commentary than Elara's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present. The narrative voice modulates with the storm's intensity, but vocabulary choices ("rarefy," "censored poet," "furiously tranquil") feel imposed by the prompt rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("She began to see," "She remembered") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully, alternating longer lyric lines with short declarative beats. Information density is high in places ("The storm's energy kissed the glass dome with a wondrous, terrifying light") but paraphrase loops appear: "furiously tranquil, a calm surface over a deep, raging sea" restates the same concept across two metaphors without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in repeated "She [verb]" stems across multiple sentences in paragraphs three and four. Stock metaphors ("darkroom of old," "sky bears its scars in lightning") and elevated diction ("rarefy," "cartography," "vigil in pause") cluster without clear payoff. The final image is clean, but scaffold sentences ("This was the place where masks slip") and thematic summary ("She understood the cartography now") dull momentum approaching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—censored poet escapes to observatory during storm—is functional but combines familiar elements (artist silenced by authority, mountaintop revelation, storm as metaphor) without a fresh synthesis. The darkroom timer is a specific detail but its use (measuring storm's peak) feels decorative rather than transformative. The envelope's cryptic summons and map-as-scar-pattern offer a turn, but the emotional arc (suppressed rage → tranquil insight) follows a template path. Proximity concern: "The sky bears its scars in lightning" echoes common storm-as-wound imagery. The "observatory not for looking out, but for looking in" reversal is clear but borders on overt symbolism. Risk-taking is modest; the piece chooses lyricism over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her poet identity frames the quest, but her choices are passive (she climbs, spreads a map, picks up the timer, writes). The decision to write a new line occurs in the final third without prior on-page struggle between competing wants. Her censorship is told rather than dramatized through choices that alter tactics. She appears in the closure unit but does not drive key turns; the storm and timer provide the pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears in paragraph two (past the first third), is set on the console in paragraph three, ticks steadily as "mechanical companion," and rings at the storm's peak to trigger the climactic moment. It is handled in three distinct beats and its function (measuring revelation, echoing her photographic past) links early setup to closure. However, it does not constrain a choice; Elara could write the poem without it. The timer's reweighted meaning (time controlled insight in the darkroom, controls revelation here) is asserted rather than shown through evolving use. Lacks causal pressure; the poem could occur if the timer were removed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is mentioned in the opening paragraph and echoed in "vigil ended" at the close, but it functions as atmospheric label rather than shaping stakes or tactics. The concept does not alter her options on the page; she could conduct the same reflection without framing it as a vigil. It resonates thematically (waiting, suspension) but does not constrain choices or drive beats. The lyric reprise provides closure resonance but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is introduced in the first paragraph as "a calm surface over a deep, raging sea of unspoken verse" and reprised in paragraph four ("The rage at her silenced voice, the peace of this high solitude, they warred within her"). It is described twice but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is label-only; we don't see her navigate a choice where calm and fury pull her in contradictory directions with a price. Swappable with "conflicted" or "torn."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears twice: "to rarefy her thoughts, to distill the chaos" (paragraph one) and "to rarefy the tumult, to filter it" (paragraph four). The action describes her goal but does not drive a turn; the rarefaction happens off-page when "she wrote not the dense, angry verses of before, but a single, pristine line." The final writing act could occur without the rarefy framing; the concept is thematic rather than causal. Present in setup and closure vicinity but does not redefine options through specific mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The sealed envelope and bus timetable appear in paragraph two as backstory ("arrived a week ago," "discovered... via a method both clumsy and fateful"). The envelope contains a cryptic line and map that bring her to the observatory, but this discovery is summarized rather than dramatized. The method (wedged in timetable) is mentioned once and does not shape her attempts or tactics on the page. At closure she places her new line inside the old envelope, a purposeful reprise, but the timetable itself vanishes. The means is functional but the bus-timetable specificity feels ornamental; "found in a café" would work equally well.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is introduced in the opening line, provides vivid sensory anchors (spiral stair, glass dome, lightning, telescope), and is reprised at closure ("stormlit altar"). The setting supplies the reflective surface (glass dome) that shows Elara her own image at the pivotal moment, directly enabling the realization "not for looking out, but for looking in." The storm's peak times the climax via the darkroom timer. The observatory's height ("above the world," "above clouds") isolates her from the Gatekeepers and enables the vigil. Specificity (telescope, console, dome) alters her tactics and charges the final image. Essential across setup, middle reflection, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is introduced in paragraph two as "the timeframe when masks slip" and reprised in paragraph four ("This was the timeframe when masks slip, and she let hers fall"). The concept frames the moment thematically but does not function as a live clock that alters moves. The storm's peak and the darkroom timer provide the temporal pressure; "masks slip" is atmospheric. The phrase resonates at closure but does not tighten decisions on the page; swappable with "moment of truth."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the cartography of scars" is stated in paragraph one and explored through the map's lines, her reflection on lost love and censorship (paragraph three), and the final realization that "each scar charted a path to this revelation." It drives her presence at the observatory and frames the climactic insight. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs; we don't see her navigate competing impulses where understanding scars conflicts with another need. The motivation shapes the thematic arc but does not force choices with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears in the opening paragraph ("wondrous, terrifying light") and is reprised in the final paragraph ("a world washed clean and full of wonder"). The tone is coherent across beats, modulating from awe and tension to calm revelation. Lightning, storm energy, and the dome's illumination charge multiple images. However, the tone does not shift under pressure in ways that reveal character cost; it remains elevated and lyric throughout. The final image uses wonder to close the arc, but the static mood prevents higher scoring. Tone supports rather than intensifies the closure.</comment>
