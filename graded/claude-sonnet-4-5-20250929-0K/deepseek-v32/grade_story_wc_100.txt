<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation ("to give rest a permanent address") is consistently present but remains abstract until late. His "inadvertent stubbornness" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene; the journey dissolves into summary ("blur of grey towns"), and the central work of cataloging signals reads as detached labor rather than embodied cost. The final calm feels asserted—"strange calm," "peaceful hum"—rather than earned through on-page struggle or visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately by the coast descent. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas finds permanence for the distress signals and himself, settling into curator duty. The cost is legible—he becomes part of the mechanism, isolated in the deep—but the escalation is largely atmospheric; the lens fitting triggers awakening without tactical complication or narrowed options. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (cataloging, settling echoes), coherent through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater library emerges vividly: "cathedral of coral-crusted spires," "shelves that curved like nautilus shells," bioluminescent dome. Spatial choreography is clear, and the broken lens on the pedestal anchors the climactic beat. The setting constrains Silas's movements (navigating impossible architecture) and charges the final image (him seated before the glowing lens), meeting the 9+ gate test. Slight penalty: the submersible and descent are compressed into summary rather than dramatized tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to distress signals—is signaled early and sustained. The lens-fitting is a reversal (nothing → awakening), but it lacks tactical complication; once inserted, the library simply awakens and Silas begins cataloging without further obstacles or narrowed options. The tightening is atmospheric (chaos → order) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is present (Silas becomes the keeper, isolated) but felt rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence for the lost, the cataloging of grief as burial. "Chased stillness" recurs purposefully, and the final image (the peaceful hum, settled pulse) reweights the opening restlessness without stating a moral. The lens as heart, the library as mausoleum, and Silas's transformation into mechanism all resonate. Minor slip: "inadvertent stubbornness had led him to the only place vast enough" borders on thematic summary rather than allowing the image to speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent: lyric, measured, slightly archaic ("burlap and smelling of salt," "chased stillness"). Psychic distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (weary, meticulous) colors the cataloging scenes. Filter verbs ("he felt certain," "he understood") are present but do not dull immediacy. Slight drag: several reflection blocks ("His inadvertent stubbornness drove him deeper," "He had given the lost cries a permanent address") lean toward helpful-narrator summary rather than trusting the dramatized image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with vivid images ("rusty bell of a thing," "waterfalls of cold brine"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the library scenes. Minor loops: "mysterious package" recurs as a phrase in both opening and close-to-ending without reweighting; "inadvertent stubbornness" appears three times, twice as tell. Template cadence in the cataloging paragraph: "A sailor's last shout was filed… A child's message… found its alcove…" reads mechanical. No artifact touches closure directly, capping deduction per non-closure rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—undertaker as curator of distress signals in an underwater archive—is specific and non-obvious. The lens-as-key and library-as-heart conceits feel earned in hindsight. Transformation test: plot and arc would flatten if recast in a terrestrial archive, so freshness is present. Slight friction: the journey and submersible hire are convenience moves (no obstacles or logistical cost shown), and the cataloging montage leans on familiar "curator finds peace" closure beats without a bold inflection at the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his choices (researching, hiring submersible, fitting lens, cataloging) shape key beats. His decision to fit the lens triggers awakening (causal turn), and his cataloging work defines the ending. He is not merely observational. Cost is implied (isolation, becoming mechanism) but not dramatized as a visible trade-off on the page. Early signal, middle and closure participation, cost linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens appears in beat 1 (package), beat 2 (research catalyst), beat 3 (fitting/awakening), and ending (glowing heart, painting his face). It is causally essential: without it the library does not awaken and the closure image collapses. Specificity high (prismatic, cracked, framework designed for it). Closure linkage strong. Cost tied to it (his transformation enabled by its function). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distress signals are the story's spine: they motivate Silas's obsession, define the library's contents, and constitute the cataloging work at closure. They shape stakes (giving rest to cries) and appear in multiple beats (research, awakening projections, cataloging montage, final hum). They are not merely thematic but operational—the signals are the objects he shelves. Cost connection moderate (his labor is the cost). Causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stubbornness is mentioned three times but remains label-only. It is told as driving him deeper ("his inadvertent stubbornness drove him") without showing contradictory impulses acting in scene or a visible cost/tradeoff on the page. No moment where stubbornness forecloses an easier path or narrows his options. Present functionally (he persists) but not dramatized as a trait with teeth. Swappable with "determination" or "obsession."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Revitalize is the action at the climax: fitting the lens awakens the library, transforming chaotic noise into settled history. It redefines the story's options (from searching to cataloging) and enables the ending state. Causal turn, closure linkage strong. The action is specific (lens insertion, glow, awakening) and not easily swappable. Cost tied to it (library's new function traps Silas as keeper). Irreplaceable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Occupying impossible spaces is described mid-story ("shelves that curved like nautilus shells, reading rooms perched on sheer rock faces") and recurs as a phrase ("his attribute… drove him deeper," "occupying impossible spaces by simply being there"). It shapes navigation tactics (he must traverse odd architecture) and charges the ending (living man in realm of echoes). Setup and closure present; middle beat involvement moderate. Somewhat abstract; could be replaced with "navigating labyrinth" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater library is essential: it houses the distress signals, its architecture constrains Silas's movements, the central dome and lens-framework enable the climax, and the final image (him seated in the gloom, library as mausoleum) depends on it. Early signal (research), middle beats (descent, navigation, central chamber), and closure (he becomes its keeper). Irreplaceable—no other setting serves this plot. Causal pressure and cost both high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is present: the package arrives Tuesday; "after" frames the journey and cataloging. Days blur during cataloging, establishing duration. Setup clear. But time does not tighten decisions or create tactical pressure—no clock, no urgency beyond Silas's internal drive. Middle and closure participation weak (time is mentioned but does not alter moves). Functional but replaceable with "one continuous journey" without much loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to give rest a permanent address") and drives the entire arc: research, journey, lens-fitting, cataloging. It shapes stakes and the ending state (he achieves his goal, finds his own rest). Closure linkage strong. Cost connection present (he becomes the permanent keeper). Slight friction: motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices on the page; the cataloging feels inevitable rather than chosen under friction. Causal pressure high despite this.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Chased stillness is introduced early ("tone of chased stillness haunted him"), recurs mid-story, and resolves at closure ("Stillness, once chased, now resided in the deep"). Tone modulates from restless pursuit to settled calm, charging the final image. Setup, development (the hunt/evasion), and payoff all present. It reweights the dominant stake (finding rest). Specificity moderate; the phrase does rhetorical work but tone itself (measured, lyric) is consistent rather than transforming under pressure.</comment>
