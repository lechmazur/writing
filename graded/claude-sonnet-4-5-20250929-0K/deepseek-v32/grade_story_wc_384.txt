<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liren's motivation is concrete and embodied through the physical labor of tracing grooves, and his insight ("not a lock, but a circuit") drives the final turn. The interior voice maintains specificity ("a key with no apparent lock," "endured wisely") and the final renunciation—exhaustion as the thorn loosens—shows visible cost. Minor deduction: the backstory exposition is extensive (~25%) but anchored to present action via the water droplet trigger, keeping present pressure alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of patient labor across decades, then deepens via the water-drop circuit realization and culminates in the blood-ink un-writing ritual. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the schism's false permanence is severed, the aurora brightens, Liren sits exhausted—options reweighted, cost visible. Orientation anchors early (pearl twilight sanctuary, Liren, rose thorn, marble floor). One meaningful deepening under the chosen lens with felt cost on the page satisfies the 600–800 word standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drips create a coherent atmosphere that directly enables the climactic circuit discovery (water droplet following the groove). The heritage rose thorn functions as tool-as-setting, constraining the un-writing method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pearl twilight, green fire aurora, mineral water). The environment pressures choice and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: atone for the forged edict by undoing its consequence. The water-drop realization narrows Liren's options from decades of searching for a lock to completing the circuit, a clear tightening. The blood-ink un-writing sequence shows agency (pricking thumb, retracing in reverse) with visible cost (exhaustion, years of labor culminating in this single act). One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens with legible price satisfies this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the forged edict as "calibrated treason," the groove as circuit not lock, un-writing as atonement. "To forgive the unfinished by removing the obstacle he himself had placed" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The heritage rose thorn and pearl twilight recur with reweighted meaning at closure. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final beat; the image (exhausted, thorn loose, twilight deepening) does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction ("calibrated treason," "unlinking things bound by fate or ink") fits a contemplative, sanctified register without modern intrusion. Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("He worked as stalactites drip") is voice-motivated and legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but serve the meditative tone. Perceptual signature is character-specific (forger's attention to stroke and ink).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; metaphors are coherent ("key with no apparent lock," "un-writing"). Information density is high (each line advances character, world, or pressure). Minor loop: "calibrated treason" recurs three times, twice within two paragraphs; the third use earns its place thematically but the early pair borders on synonym churn. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure unit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy forgery, un-writing via blood and thorn, and atonement-as-circuit feels specific and earned. The risk—un-writing rather than correcting—is bold and coherent. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc would collapse with generic substitutions. The final image (thorn loose, twilight deepening) is memorable and non-obvious. Proximity check clear; no echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liren's realization (groove as circuit) and choice to prick his thumb and un-write drive the climactic turn. Present early, shapes middle insight, active in closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heritage rose thorn: introduced early, used to trace grooves for decades, then pricked for blood-ink in the climax. Its hardness ("harder than flint") and history enable the un-writing; swapping it would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Calibrated treason frames the original crime and the atonement strategy. It shapes stakes (atonement as "calibrated" un-doing) and recurs across beats, but the concept is more thematic anchor than on-page tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" is enacted through decades of labor and the patient study of regret. It enables the climactic insight but is more trait-label than visible choice-trade on the page; the cost is duration rather than a discrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unlink: the un-writing ritual is the climactic action, causally prepared by the circuit realization and irreplaceable. Removing it collapses the closure; no near-synonym could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"A key with no apparent lock" seeds the problem early, recurs in Liren's decades of searching, and is resolved when he discovers the groove is a circuit, not a lock. The mechanics matter and shape the middle attempts and final method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary under aurora: the setting provides the stalactite drip timing, the groove floor, and the aurora's brightening response to the un-writing. It pressures the method and participates visibly in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" establishes deep time and patient labor. A single droplet triggers the circuit insight, giving the timeframe modest causal work, but it does not tighten choices in real-time; the feel is metaphorical duration rather than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To forgive the unfinished: motivates Liren's decades of labor and the final un-writing act. It is dramatized through the blood-ink ritual and the removal of his own obstacle, with visible cost (exhaustion, years spent). Slight friction: the motivation is more voiced interiority than on-page want-versus-fear conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Pearl twilight: coherent throughout, modulates subtly (deepens to "tranquil, enduring grey" at closure), and charges the final image. The tone supports the meditative atonement arc without static repetition.</comment>
