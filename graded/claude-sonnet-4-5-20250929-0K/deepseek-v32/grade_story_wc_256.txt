<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of connection") but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Her "powerfully gentle" approach remains a label without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "discovery" that connection has texture feels asserted rather than earned through struggle, and no path is foreclosed. Interiority reads as exposition rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), but no meaningful closure unit appears. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through the middle, yet the ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost—Elara simply continues her work. The "artificial pilgrimage" completes but no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes, and the broadcast to the city arrives without causal linkage to prior pressure. Cost is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is anchored with "golden shadows" and sensory detail (bells, lens, fixtures), but remains largely decorative. The miner's carbide lamp lens is handled in multiple beats and the archive/bell apparatus supplies resources, yet the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice or charge the final image with spatial or tactile pressure. Micro-setting (lens, bells) functions but does not tighten options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering texture of connection) is signaled early but never escalates through a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Elara's "artificial pilgrimage" unfolds as a sequence of observations and correlations without reversal, trade-off, or visible cost. The resolution—broadcasting the symphony—arrives without protagonist agency forcing a difficult choice. Pressure remains flat from midpoint to end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (connection, memory, resilience) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from conflict and image. The lens-as-key and texture-of-connection motifs are asserted in near-identical phrasing across multiple beats without transforming prior material. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to resilience," "symphony of connections") instead of offering a resonant image. No earned wisdom arises from on-page struggle; epiphany is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, diction is generic and template-driven: recycled stems ("She questioned," "She propelled," "She realized") and stock phrasing ("golden shadows," "powerfully gentle") flatten voice. Perceptual signature is absent—Elara's way of noticing reads interchangeable with any narrator. Rhythm is monotonous; syntactic variety is minimal across the second half.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "artificial pilgrimage" and "texture of connection" are restated in adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She questioned...," "She propelled...," "She continued...") across 6+ beats. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she noticed," "she realized") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of sound and light," "golden shadows") recur without fresh specificity. The final third is particularly loop-heavy, and these artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (sound archivist uses ancestor's lens to unlock lost memories) is functional but derivative, closely matching familiar "memory-recovery through artifact" templates. "Prism-song," "artificial pilgrimage," and "texture of connection" are prompt-label ornaments rather than transformed concepts with surprising implications. The emotional arc and plot beats could swap in different names/places without structural change. No fresh inflection reweights prior material in hindsight; the ending fulfills template expectations without risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observations drive the sequence, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her decisions (align lens, clean bell, broadcast symphony) are procedural rather than pressured. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is observational only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in setup, middle (projecting light, cleaning the bell), and the final reflection ("once used to see in dark mines, now helped see into time"). It is handled in three distinct beats and its focusing property enables the key discovery. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost, and a generic magnifying lens could substitute with minor edits. Specific irreplaceability is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "artificial pilgrimage" is named repeatedly and frames Elara's journey, satisfying setup and development gates. However, it remains thematic rather than causal—it does not narrow options or impose a cost. The pilgrimage's completion is declared ("complete") but no on-page consequence or trade-off arises from it. The concept is label-only in the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is mentioned four times as a trait label but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No scene demonstrates a trade-off between power and gentleness. The attribute is decorative and could be removed without altering any beat. Closure participation is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Propel" and "propelled" appear in setup, middle, and closure, satisfying the gate model. The action is tied to the pilgrimage and archive traversal. However, "propel" is abstract and swappable with "drive," "pursue," or "advance" without structural change. It does not redefine options or impose a cost in any beat. The verb is present but functionally generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled early and recurs in three beats (connection purely auditory, pilgrimage requiring travel, connection having texture). The method shapes Elara's approach and is present in the closure reflection. However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—no assumption is tested with on-page resistance or cost. The method is label-driven; its causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored in setup and provides resources (bells, archives, resonant plates) used across multiple beats. The setting supplies the tools for Elara's discovery and is present in the final image. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a spatial cost. The lab functions as backdrop rather than micro-setting that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilized" bookends the piece (first line, final third) and provides context for the lab's operation. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time is untracked within the narrative window; the stability is static rather than a constraint that alters moves. Closure participation is thematic mention only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is declared in setup and recurs throughout, satisfying setup and development gates. It is present in the closure image ("texture of connection was now a living thing"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between want and cost appears on the page. The motivation is told and affirmed rather than tested with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in setup, middle, and closure, providing a consistent atmospheric motif. The tone is stable and melancholic throughout, modulating slightly as Elara's discovery progresses. The phrase returns in the final image ("golden shadows of dawn") with mild reweighting. However, the tone does not charge the closure with fresh pressure or cost; it remains decorative. Two gates with lyric reprise place it in mid-band.</comment>
