<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her realization arrives as epiphany rather than earned struggle: "belonging was not about fitting in, but about hearing the syncopated beat" reads as thematic assertion rather than character-specific insight forged from prior cost. The "softly ingenious" trait appears as label only; no on-page action demonstrates ingenuity constraining or enabling a choice. Kael's presence functions as exposition delivery without applying relationship pressure or forcing Elara to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density around the bloom is meant to reweight the stake. However, the closure unit—Elara's understanding of the feather and belonging—arrives via exposition ("she realized," "she saw now," "Elara understood at last") rather than image or action that dramatizes the shift. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but causality is loose—the feather's connection to the bloom is told retroactively without prior dramatized clues that would let the reader trace the linkage. No meaningful tightening occurs; the bloom's arrival is coincidental timing, not driven by Elara's agency or prior setup, and the final "rhythm" is asserted rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater facility and drowned city are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail: "pressure-black depths," "bioluminescent algae smeared blue ghosts onto stone," "brittle capsule of light and air." Spatial choreography is clear and the viewport anchors recurring physical positioning. The setting does not constrain a key choice, however—Elara's revelation about the feather could occur in any research station. The burnt feather on the desk and the bloom outside function as observed objects rather than tactile tools that alter tactics, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's quest for belonging—is signaled early but never tightened through a choice that narrows options or raises cost. The bloom's arrival is coincidental (Kael returns; the season turns) rather than the result of Elara's agency or a reversal that tests her commitment. The final "understanding" is delivered via summary ("Elara understood at last") with no on-page trade-off or visible price paid. No credible escalation under the Accumulative lens because the sensory intensification of the bloom does not force Elara to renounce, endure, or choose between competing paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of belonging emerges through the cosmic-fire seed / bloom cycle, a specific and non-obvious synthesis. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "belonging was not about fitting in, but about hearing the syncopated beat between land, sky, and sea" is a thematic echo that articulates the lesson rather than letting image carry it. The burnt feather returns at closure but as metaphor ("less like ash and more like a seed") rather than a choice-constraining object, diluting resonance. The piece invites reflection but does so through assertion rather than ambiguity or dramatic irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature—star charts, sonar etchings, celestial algorithms—is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. However, at peak beats the prose drifts into elevated register that exceeds Elara's lived interiority: "a curl of carbonized void," "syncopated beat between land, sky, and sea" read as authorial rather than character-particular phrasing. Kael's brief dialogue is functional but tonally generic; no idiomatic distinction. Free indirect style is clean but the final paragraph shifts into summary-tell that flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template-cadence runs mar several beats: "The feather's origin haunted her… / Her work as a landscape astrologer here… / Yet her true quest…" creates a mechanical pivot pattern. Overwriting clusters in the opening: "pressure-black depths," "shadowseam wonder," "curl of carbonized void" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph loops thematically: "rhythm of belonging" → "syncopated beat" → "rhythm now, steady and sure" restates the same idea across three lines. Paraphrase loop: "Elara understood at last: belonging was not about fitting in, but about hearing…" then immediately "Elara felt the rhythm now" re-asserts the same realization. Cumulative artifact debt in Q7: template cadence −0.4, overwriting cluster −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2, total ~−1.0 within the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The landscape astrologer profession and the burnt-feather-as-cosmic-seed link offer a fresh synthesis. The confluence of celestial event, mineral seeding, and seasonal bloom is non-obvious and specificity-driven. However, the "belonging = rhythm" resolution is a familiar emotional template, and the final realization that "belonging was not about fitting in" echoes self-help idiom rather than lived, irreducible particulars. The piece commits fully to its premise but retreats into abstraction at closure, lowering originality impact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession frames the investigation, satisfying setup. She adjusts her astrolabe mid-story (development beat) and the final realization ties star charts to bloom rhythm (closure participation). However, her agency is passive: she observes, theorizes, and understands rather than making a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The landscape astrologer role could be swapped for any observatory researcher without structural loss. Caps: swappability 3.8, ornamental observation −0.5, late-stage summary-only use −0.4. Final band: replaceable function, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears early (setup), hums during the bloom (development touch), and returns reweighted as seed metaphor at closure (all three gates). It is handled twice: resting on the desk, then described "catching the bioluminescent dance." However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; Elara's realization about the feather is told ("she realized," "she saw now") rather than dramatized through action. The feather's cosmic origin is explained retroactively without prior on-page clues. Swappability moderate: another cosmic artifact (meteorite fragment, ash sample) could serve the same symbolic role. Gates met (all three) → eligible ≥6.1, but causal pressure low and cost absent → mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is named once in narration ("hoping for a luminous respite") and the bloom provides visual relief. Setup marginal (late first third), development absent (the concept does not shape a middle choice), closure weak (the bloom offers sensory awe but no trade-off or tactical shift tied to "respite"). The concept is thematic decoration rather than a stake-shaping force. Gates: setup borderline, development missing (cap 3.4), closure participation token only. Ornamental use −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" appears twice as label: "Elara, softly ingenious, had not discarded it" and "With a softly ingenious adjustment, she aligned her astrolabe." Neither instance dramatizes a choice constrained or enabled by the trait; the astrolabe adjustment is summary without on-page detail showing ingenuity under pressure or its cost. Setup present (early mention), development and closure absent. Label-only trait −0.8, no visible tradeoff −0.6. Gate cap (missing development and closure) 2.8, small upward nudge for dual mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Captivate" operates once at the bloom's arrival: "The sight worked to captivate them completely, freezing time in a sphere of awe." This beat provides the story's emotional peak and sets up Elara's realization (closure linkage). However, the action is passive (they are captivated by external event) rather than Elara's agency driving a turn. Setup late (second half), development minimal (one beat), closure indirect (the captivation enables but does not itself constitute the final understanding). Gates: setup late (−0.3), development single beat (+0.4), closure linkage moderate (+0.7), swappability moderate (any moment of awe could serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" occurs on-page at the bloom's ignition: "Then, a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer: as one, they breathed out, and outside, the new bloom ignited." The method is signaled (Kael's arrival, the jar of phosphorescent dots) and its mechanics matter (the simultaneous breath marks the seasonal threshold). Setup via Kael's sample jar (first half), development in the shared breath beat, closure participation strong (the bloom's ignition directly enables Elara's final insight). All three gates met. Causal pressure moderate: the method triggers the bloom but does not constrain Elara's choice. Cost absent. Specificity high (irreplaceable image). Gates all met → eligible ≥6.1, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal moderate +0.6, minus late setup −0.2, swappability low +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underwater research facility is anchored early and vividly detailed (setup strong). It provides the viewport through which the bloom is observed (development: setting enables the key sensory beat) and the final dawn light filtering from above charges the closure image (all three gates). However, the facility does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's tactics; it is a vivid stage rather than an active force. Spatial choreography is clear. Gates all met → eligible ≥6.1, early signal +0.5, two beats (viewport bloom, dawn light) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure low (postcard description mode) −0.6, irreplaceability moderate (any underwater lab would serve) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is mentioned in the opening ("silent hours until sunrise") and the final paragraph delivers dawn: "A pale, filtered light began to bleed from above, dissolving the night." Setup and closure gates met; development absent (no mid-story beat where the approaching deadline tightens a choice). Time is not tracked or felt as pressure; no clock narrows Elara's options. Gates: setup yes, development missing (cap 3.4), closure yes (but arrival is passive environmental change, not a tactic-altering force). Ornamental timeframe −0.5, no tactical pressure −0.4, small upward nudge for dual mention +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated early (setup) and the final realization directly addresses it (closure). Development weak: the motivation is not dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible cost mid-story. The desire is told ("her true quest was for a pattern deeper than tectonics: a pattern of home") rather than shown through friction between wants and obstacles. Gates: setup strong, development minimal (no choice driven by this want with cost), closure strong (the final "rhythm" ties back). Told-only trend −0.6, friction absent −0.5, closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" is named once and evoked consistently through imagery: "the seam between eternal night and artificial lamplight throbbed with mystery," the bioluminescent bloom, the burnt feather's hum. Tone is coherent across beats and modulates from curiosity to awe at the bloom without jarring shifts. The final image ("the burnt feather looked less like ash and more like a seed") carries tonal charge. Setup strong (early anchor), development implicit (tone sustained through sensory accumulation), closure strong (wonder crystallized in the seed image). All gates met. Static mood risk mitigated by the bloom's intensification. Gates all met → eligible ≥6.1, coherence +0.6, closure charge +0.8, modulation moderate +0.4, single explicit mention (reliance on evocation rather than re-anchor) −0.3, template phrase ("shadowseam wonder" as neologism label) −0.3.</comment>
