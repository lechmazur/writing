<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted—an immortal seeking finality—though his interior reads more philosophical than viscerally embodied. The commitment to step through and cast away the fragment shows agency with cost, and the final realization ("no witness, only the unobserved fact") earns the transformation. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward abstraction ("desperate intrigue sharper than any feeling") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost: Elian unravels and the immortal is gone, the question extinguished. The Causal lens holds—storm triggers fragment, fragment opens escondite, escondite demands participation, participation costs existence—each move narrowing options. The Orientation Test is met early (tower, storm, obsidian table). One meaningful tightening occurs when the escondite rejects its own structure and forces the final threshold choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tower, lodestones, obsidian table, and prismatic escondite ground the piece spatially; the escondite's geometry-as-language and folding corridors constrain Elian's navigation and charge the final void image. The solar storm's magnetic flux is woven through action (channeling planetary fury, magnetic tides unraveling him), not merely described. Sensory selection is purposeful: "colors there were not light, but substances; geometry was a language he could nearly taste." The environment directly enables and ultimately consumes the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering what follows goodbye—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through manipulation of lodestones, entry into the escondite, confrontation with the curse's consciousness, and the final threshold. The escondite's convulsion and the fragment's shift from key to participation-gate constitute a meaningful reversal that narrows options to a single choice with visible cost. Agency is clear: Elian commands, casts the fragment, and accepts unraveling. The price is legible on the page: "tearing, not of space, but of self."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and event: the question of aftermath, the cost of knowing, the paradox that discovery requires cessation of the discoverer. The recurring motif of "goodbye" shifts from abstract inquiry to embodied participation; the final image ("no witness, only the unobserved fact of the ended thing") reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the whispering curse, the echoes of final goodbyes that show effects but never aftermath, and the silent void at center. No thematic echo or sermon; the ending delivers a non-literal, resonant answer rooted in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV; psychic distance is controlled and stable. Perceptual signature is distinct: an immortal's weariness, dimensional awareness rendered as angles fracturing and depth becoming a lie. Diction is elevated but consistent with the voice ("spatial mutiny," "topological labyrinth," "prismatic escondite"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the final beats ("soundless detonation," "tearing, not of space, but of self") heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Elision of physical sensation during unraveling is brief and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; rhythm varies and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor register note: "crushing weight of endless time" and "desperate intrigue sharper than any feeling" edge toward stock phrasing, but the bulk of the prose is specific ("magnetic filaments dancing in the corona like accusing ghosts," "corridors folding like origami to his intent"). Propulsion is consistent; figurative language serves the scene without overwriting. Final image is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortality-seeking-end, magnetic-field activation, and dimensional-pocket discovery is specific and non-obvious. The pivot from "key to a place" to "key to a state" and the requirement that discovery demands self-erasure feel earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-philosophical final beats heightens stakes without gimmickry; the resolution commits fully to its premise. Transformation of the tired immortal-quest trope through dimensional physics and the paradox of witness elevates originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bored immortal Elian drives all major turns: manipulates lodestones, steps through the gateway, commands the curse, casts the fragment, accepts unraveling. Present throughout; his choices narrow options at every beat and his final decision—participation over observation—is the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cursed amulet fragment appears early (paragraph four), hums in response to the storm (paragraph seven), becomes a compass in the escondite (paragraph sixteen), glows and reveals its purpose as participation-key (paragraph twenty-five), and is cast into the void in the climax (paragraph thirty). Its meaning evolves from dormant key to active agent to anchor-to-eternity. Removing it breaks the entire causal chain and closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is dramatized on the page: "the space before him rebelled—a spatial mutiny where angles fractured and depth became a lie" (paragraph eleven). The escondite's corridors fold to intent, layers peel back, and the realm convulses and rejects its own structure, forcing the final threshold. It shapes stakes (access to the answer), tactics (navigation via fragment-compass), and closure (the void at center, the unraveling). The concept is not merely thematic; it alters options and costs throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware trait appears early ("dimensionally aware in a way Elian could only faintly perceive," paragraph six) and enables his recognition of the escondite's geometry-as-language and his navigation of the topological labyrinth. The curse mirrors his dimensional awareness (paragraph eighteen). It constrains his perception and enables his movement, though the on-page cost tied specifically to this trait versus his general immortal nature is somewhat oblique. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intrigue is present as "desperate intrigue sharper than any feeling" (paragraph fourteen) and drives Elian's step into the escondite. It motivates exploration but does not itself create the major structural turns; those trace more directly to the fragment's mechanics and the curse's consciousness. The action supports the middle movement but could be swapped with "curiosity" or "compulsion" without breaking the plot. Functional, present across beats, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled early (solar storm, magnetic filaments, paragraph two), the method is discovered on the page ("it responded not to magic, but to magnetic fields," paragraph eight), and Elian manipulates lodestones to channel planetary fury into focused flux (paragraph nine). The storm's peak surges through the magnetic link to trigger the escondite's convulsion (paragraphs twenty-one–twenty-two), and magnetic tides unravel his being (paragraph twenty-eight). The mechanism shapes attempts, enables the gateway, and delivers the final cost. Removing it breaks causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is introduced at the story's first major turn (paragraph twelve), described with specific constraints (colors as substances, geometry as language, corridors folding to intent), and supplies the curse's consciousness, the echoes of goodbyes, and the silent void at center. It alters tactics (movement via fragment-compass), pressures choice (convulsion and rejection force the threshold), and houses the closure image. The setting is not merely backdrop; it is the mechanism of discovery and cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Solar storm is present from the opening line ("hushed thunder of a gathering solar storm"), triggers the fragment's hum (paragraph seven), provides the magnetic flux Elian channels (paragraph nine), and reaches its peak to surge power through the link and convulse the escondite (paragraphs twenty-one–twenty-two). The storm's timing tightens the window and its power is the engine of the gateway and unraveling. The timeframe shapes all tactics and the final cosmic drumroll (paragraph thirty-two). Strong integration with causal work across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover what happens after goodbye" is stated early (paragraph three), dramatized through Elian's millennia-long search and latest hope (paragraphs four–five), tested by the curse's echoes that show partings but never aftermath (paragraph nineteen), and resolved in the climax when he realizes discovery requires participation—saying goodbye to existence itself (paragraph twenty-six). The desire drives every choice, creates friction (observation vs. participation), and the final cost is the answer: "no witness, only the unobserved fact of the ended thing" (paragraph thirty-four). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears in the opening line and returns as "the hushed thunder of the solar storm was the last sensation, a cosmic drumroll for his departure" (paragraph thirty-two), framing the piece. Tone throughout balances quiet awe with mounting pressure: "low thrum, a sound felt more than heard" (paragraph ten), "whispering presence" (paragraph eighteen), "soundless detonation" (paragraph thirty-one), "profound, peaceful silence" (paragraph thirty-three). The tone modulates with escalation and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful across turns.</comment>
