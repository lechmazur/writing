<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is articulated but remains conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Her "calm defiance" registers as a label; internal contradiction never acts in scene—she moves methodically without visible competing impulses. The final realization ("strength is not a fortress, but a language") arrives as statement rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Thorne is summarized via journal entries; his presence never pressures Elara's choices directly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by line 2; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring motifs (spider/web, dance, encryption metaphor) toward a conceptual repricing at closure. The ending reweights "vulnerability as strength" through the final image of Elara "encrypted but not imprisoned," but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift marks a before/after with felt pressure. The closure unit (CR) is present but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than made undeniable through scene work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab is vivid and consistent: "serene blue gloom," "silt-covered desk," "servers… flickered to life" anchor spatial detail. The hangman's dice function as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure when Elara places them back as tribute. The environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's access to the console is unopposed, no physical obstacle shapes her tactics—so the 9+ gate is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate Thorne's work) is signaled early and pursued without reversal. No meaningful tightening occurs: Elara inputs the sequence, the server activates, transfer completes. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency narrow options or impose cost. The final choice to "not let this knowledge drown" is declared rather than tested by on-page friction. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is acceptable, but pressure remains static rather than escalating through the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability encoded as strength) emerges through motifs—dance as cipher, the hangman's dice, Thorne's emotional architecture—but the final insight is stated: "strength is not a fortress, but a language." The particulars (dice, dance, journal) accumulate texture yet the ending articulates the thesis rather than offering a non-literal answer. No competing interpretation or moral ambiguity lingers; the closure ties the conceptual bow neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; focalization through Elara is clean with no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: "she worked as a spider spins its web," kinetic decoding through dance, sensory specificity in "soft click" of dice. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("lexicon," "aqueous tomb") but remains voice-plausible for a code breaker. No dialogue on the page to test character distinction. Elision is purposeful (Thorne's vanishing) and paid off in the journal reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm support the quiet tone; no paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language clusters in mid-beats: "spider spins," "shattered mirror of sunlight," "encrypted but not imprisoned." The final metaphor stack ("encrypted but not imprisoned, carrying a liberated strength") approaches overwriting but remains legible. Minor template cadence in expository paragraphs ("He believed… He had turned…") does not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some beats (console activation, server hum) advance setup without layering new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—code breaker in sunken lab retrieves encrypted emotional resilience program—synthesizes cyber-thriller and philosophical subtext. The hangman's dice as physical cipher offers a fresh inflection. Yet the emotional arc (seeking strength, finding philosophy) follows a familiar template: quest for tool → discovery of wisdom. Transformation test: the core insight could transfer to different names and settings with minor edits. No close echo of famous lines, but the "fortress vs. language" dichotomy reads abstract rather than irreplaceably specific to Elara's lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final decision to transfer the data (payoff). Her code-breaking shapes the middle sequence (development). Setup anchors her role by paragraph 2. Her choices narrow options (she decodes, inputs sequence, initiates transfer) but the lyrical attribute overshadows tactical agency—observation and interpretation dominate over high-cost decisions. Two gates met solidly; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear mid-story (observation room), are handled and understood as cipher (first beat), generate the seed phrase (second beat), and return at closure as tribute (third beat). Setup delayed to second third (−0.3), but three distinct beats (+1.4) and closure linkage (+0.9) elevate. Causal pressure: the dice enable the vault unlock, a key turn. Specificity: "faces carved with letters" is irreplaceable to the cipher mechanic. Cost connection weak—no visible price tied to their use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is named in paragraph 2 (setup) and surfaces again at closure ("solidified into resolution"). It registers as tone and trait rather than shaping on-page choices—Elara's tactics (decode, dance, input) proceed methodically without visible friction between calm and defiance. The concept echoes thematically but does not constrain or alter a middle decision (no development gate). Ornamental use (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" appears mid-story: Elara dances to decode rhythm, translating encryption into kinetic language (one beat). Setup delayed to second third (−0.3). Development: the dance clarifies pattern, enabling the next step (causal pressure +0.6). No closure participation (missing payoff gate, −0.6 cap at ~6.0). Specificity moderate—gesture could be swapped for another sensory metaphor with edits (−0.5). Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the mission verb, framing expectation by paragraph 3 (setup +0.5). It drives the decode sequence, the data transfer (two beats +0.9), and the closure action ("initiated the data transfer… burden lifted" +1.2). Causal pressure high: the act redefines Thorne's legacy and Elara's stance (+1.0). Cost connection: she chooses release over retention, a conceptual forfeit (+0.4). Specificity: the verb is mission-specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are signaled early ("scattered and protected by complex linguistic traps," paragraph 7, setup +0.4) and their decoding shapes the middle sequence (development +0.5). The final entry details Thorne's struggle, priming Elara's realization (closure linkage +0.8). Mechanics: the entries impose linguistic obstacles, altering tactics (+0.7). Causal pressure moderate; the method constrains but does not narrow options with visible cost. Specificity strong—linguistic cipher fits Thorne's poet-scientist profile (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory anchors setting by line 1 (setup +0.6). It supplies the console, servers, and ambient detail across multiple beats (development +0.6). At closure, the lab is left to "silent watch," a charged final image (+0.9). Causal pressure: the setting provides resources (console, servers) but does not impose obstacle or alter Elara's tactics—access is unopposed (moderate pressure +0.4). Specificity high: "aqueous tomb" and submersion motif are irreplaceable (+0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" is named in paragraph 5 (late setup, second third −0.4) and repeated at the transfer beat ("slow and deliberate, as a spider spins"). It frames tempo thematically but does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions—Elara's actions proceed without time pressure (no causal constraint −0.8). Lyric reprise present (+0.3) but ornamental. Swappable metaphor (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated by paragraph 6 (setup +0.5). It drives Elara's decode effort (development +0.5) and reappears at closure in her realization ("strength is not a fortress, but a language" +0.9). Causal pressure: the desire frames her quest and the final insight (+0.8). Cost connection: she sought a tool, found philosophy—opportunity cost implied (+0.3). Friction modest; the want is pursued without on-page obstacle or competing desire (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is named late (paragraph 18, final third −0.8) and echoed at closure ("mysterious familiarity of a self finally decoded" +0.7). The tone (quiet, contemplative) is stable through turns and modulates subtly at the server activation. It charges the final image by reweighting Elara's self-knowledge (+0.6). Setup missing (introduced late), development weak (tone asserted rather than enacted in a middle choice). Lyric reprise partial; the phrasing recurs but does not transform prior pressure.</comment>
