<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and sustained, but his interior life reads as abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "gently systematic precision" remains a label; we never see him struggle against impatience or despair in a moment that would give the trait cost. The final discovery unfolds without genuine mistake or misstep—he reviews, understands, executes—flattening what could be urgent into procedural competence. No micro-choice forecloses a live option with visible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and the causal chain (crack → vibration → song → name → light) is legible under a Causal lens. However, the central turn—finding the fossilized vibration after "centuries" of search—arrives without prior failed attempts or narrowing options on the page; it reads as a single lucky discovery rather than earned escalation. The closure (light restored) lands with conceptual cost ("a reminder of all that was still silent"), but that cost feels asserted in the final paragraph rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible trade-off during the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal library, liquid-crystal tree, and cracked bamboo tube are vivid and purposeful, each constraining or enabling key moves (the crack holds the vibration, the tube must be held against the index). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—"velvet shadows of obsolete nostalgia"—and spatial choreography remains clear. The setting charges the final image (walls drinking in sound, glass orchids trembling), meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure, though some phrases ("liquid pearl," "foxglove regret") tip toward ornamental rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve the last feeling and its name to save the library) is signaled early and remains coherent. The single reversal—realizing the crack is not broken but a deliberate resonator—tightens options, but it arrives as insight rather than agency-driven choice that forecloses a path. No visible trade-off: Arlen does not sacrifice another entry, risk his own light, or endure a competing pressure. The resolution feels procedural rather than earned through protagonist struggle with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (interconnection, preservation of others' lives, grief for what is almost lost) emerges cleanly from image and event without moralizing. The final image—light spreading, "a reminder of all that was still silent"—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. However, "foxglove regret—beautiful, towering, and quietly poisonous" in the climax reads as an explicit thematic caption rather than trusting the dramatized moment. The single bright point "might yet be again" edges toward consolation that softens the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent, elevated register appropriate to the archival/mythic setting. Perceptual signature is present (systematic, light-focused) but not strongly individuated; Arlen's noticing reads generic-observant rather than character-particular. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "sweet and unbearably poignant" and "foxglove regret" drift into writerly summary of emotion rather than embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate; filter verbs ("He understood," "He knew") are acceptable here given the contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("a great tree of liquid crystal," "visible resonance"). However, pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching lowers momentum: "velvet shadows," "liquid pearl," "foxglove regret" cluster in high-pressure beats, and "tone of foxglove regret—beautiful, towering, and quietly poisonous with the grief" exemplifies over-explanation that dulls the climax. Minor paraphrase loop: "The library was dying, its light fading" recaps the premise without added pressure. Template cadence in the pilgrimage paragraph ("the dusty silence," "the cool vacuum," "the velvet shadows") stacks parallel constructions mechanically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—caretaker, sound-as-essence, cracked resonator, extinct feelings—is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (lonely keeper restores lost wonder through ancient knowledge) follows a familiar mythic template without transformation through lived friction or moral calculus. The crack-as-deliberate-resonator twist is clever but arrives late and resolves immediately without complication, reading more as puzzle-key than hard-won discovery. Risk-aversion is visible: no competing claim on the library, no cost to Arlen personally beyond "reminder," no choice between preserving one name and losing another.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlen is the POV throughout and his action (holding the bamboo, channeling the song) triggers the climax. However, most beats are observation and understanding rather than choice under friction. His "gently systematic" method succeeds on first try; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in all three gates (setup, middle search, ending action) but swappable with any diligent scholar-figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears early (founding relic), drives the middle turn (fossilized vibration in the crack), and is physically present at closure (held against the index, glowing with sound). Its unique property—crack as resonator—is irreplaceable and causally decisive. It shapes two beats (discovery, final use) and the ending image ("humming softly in his hand"). Would score higher if Arlen had attempted other methods first, establishing cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the opening and recurs as thematic texture (extinct feelings, forgotten names), but does not constrain or enable a specific choice. The library could be thriving-but-threatened without altering Arlen's method or stakes. Present in setup and ending ("no longer deserted"), but the concept remains atmospheric rather than a live pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is attributed early ("moved with a gently systematic precision") and mentioned at closure ("systemically mended"), but remains a label. No moment shows gentleness costing him speed or system preventing an intuitive leap. The trait does not visibly enable the crack-discovery or song-triggering; those succeed through knowledge, not method-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Light is the library's life-force (opening: "light fading"), the measure of success (middle: dull song-sheets), and the climactic action ("wave of gentle illumination," "opal walls brightened"). The final image turns on light's return. Removing "light" would require replacing the entire stakes and closure. Causal across all three gates and irreplaceable, though the mechanics (sound → light) are asserted rather than earned through prior failed attempts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("restoration by the echo of a long-forgotten song"), pursued in the middle (searching spectral records, finding the score), and executed at closure (channeling the song's notation to trigger its echo). It shapes two beats and the ending. Would score higher if the song required multiple attempts or a trade-off; here it succeeds on first invocation without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opal library is anchored early and provides key resources (central index, halls of extinct feelings, song gallery). Its "above clouds" location remains decorative; height does not constrain access or escape. The setting shapes the search (where to look) and the ending image (walls brightening), but micro-setting (the crack, the index) does more tactical work than the grand library itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" describes spatial movement, not a timeframe that tightens decisions. "Centuries" of prior search are mentioned but not dramatized; the on-page action unfolds without a live clock. "One day" marks the discovery, but no deadline pressures Arlen's choices. Present as thematic texture (long time = loss) but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation (preserve the sound of forgotten names) is stated early, sustained throughout, and rewarded at closure (the name "Elara" rings out). It drives his search and final action. However, it is never conflicted: no competing desire, no temptation to abandon the work, no cost that tests his commitment. The want is singular and unchallenged, limiting friction and depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret—beautiful, towering, and quietly poisonous with the grief" is explicitly named at the climax and colors the ending ("both a victory and a reminder"). The tone is coherent (elegiac, bittersweet) but static; no modulation with rising pressure or tonal shift at the turn. The label itself ("foxglove regret") is over-explained on the page rather than embodied, weakening its charge.</comment>
