<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation—discovering time's texture—is concrete and drives his choices, though the internal contradiction feels more asserted than embodied in simultaneous pressure. The decision to refuse transcendence is earned by prior layering, but the climactic moment leans toward philosophical articulation rather than visceral pull between contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is present in tactile details (rope's "rough, familiar bite"), yet the peak choice reads more as contemplative weighing than urgent struggle. The renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost, meeting the closure bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (poet, grotto, post-arrival world). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered visions, the rope's symbolic charge deepens, and the closure image—writing on clay—reweights the opening craving with visible cost (limitation embraced). One meaningful tightening occurs when the beings present the binary choice, narrowing options. The cost is legible in the final refusal and the shift from transcendence to translation, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (cool air, ancient dust, whorled walls) and micro-setting elements (the rope, charcoal, clay) recur with functional weight. The grotto constrains the poet's choice spatially and metaphorically—its layered clay becomes the medium for his final act. Sensory selection reflects the poet's perceptual priorities, and the setting charges the closure image directly. The starlight and terra-cotta texture integrate into the thematic weave without ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to satisfy the craving for time's texture—is signaled early and tightens when the beings present two divergent paths. The binary choice is a clear escalation that narrows options with felt cost: transcendence versus remaining human. Agency is present in the poet's refusal, an endurance that forecloses transcendence. However, the beings' arrival and vision-granting feel more given than earned through protagonist struggle, softening the causal pressure slightly. The cost is visible on the page in the final gesture and choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the frayed rope as symbol of decisive breaks, the grotto's layered clay as time's texture, and the final act of writing as translation rather than transcendence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—embracing limitation over omniscience—without stated moral. Subtext operates through image and gesture (rope as "paperweight for the pages of the now"). The piece resists tidy resolution, leaving the poet's choice ambiguous in its wisdom yet coherent in its cost. No thematic echo mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored to the poet's perceptual signature (texture-focused, lyric). Diction is elevated but voice-consistent, though at peak moments ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") the register drifts toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied tension. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the vision sequence. No head-hopping. The prose reflects the poet's mind, yet some constructions—"the weave of all choices, made and unmade"—feel more authorial thesis than character thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully, rhythm modulates with scene pressure, and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "He saw... He saw... The poet saw" in the vision sequence, and the closure paragraph stacks similar stems ("He looked... He understood... He reached... He looked"). The metaphor "texture of time" recurs productively but borders on overuse. Figurative density in the final third (sediment, translucent pages, grain, weave) is vivid yet risks slight muddle. No major clarity breaks, but momentum drag from repetitive phrasing caps the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—poet meets energy beings in grotto, chooses human limitation over transcendence—transforms familiar ascension-refusal tropes through the specificity of "texture of time" and the rope's prison-escape backstory. The vision mechanics and the binary choice feel purposeful but not wholly unexpected. Emotional honesty is present, yet the setup leans on established SF frames (luminous aliens, layered time, merging consciousness). The ending commits to its stance without hedging, and the rope's reprise reweights prior material. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece executes its concept cleanly but does not radically subvert genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting poet is present throughout and makes the key closure choice (refusing transcendence), altering tactics from seeking to chronicling. However, much of the narrative is observational—visions are presented to him—and his decisive act arrives only at the end. Early and closure beats both feature him, meeting two gates, and the choice has visible cost. Swappability is moderate; another contemplative wanderer could fill the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frayed rope appears in three distinct beats: carried as relic, humming with residual tension during the vision, and finally held as the poet refuses transcendence. It is handled on the page and its meaning evolves from symbol of escape to "paperweight for the pages of the now," reweighting the closure image. Setup is clear, development occurs via the vision, and payoff charges the final gesture. Causal pressure is moderate—it constrains the poet's conceptual framing but does not enable or block a physical tactic. Specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Impossible choices shape the entire narrative arc: the escapee's past choice (freedom vs. abandonment) and the poet's present choice (transcendence vs. chronicling) are both framed as binary dilemmas with visible cost. The concept drives the climactic decision and is dramatized rather than merely thematic. Setup occurs in the escapee backstory, development through the vision sequence, and payoff in the poet's refusal. Causal pressure is strong—the choice narrows options definitively. Slight swappability: another high-stakes binary could substitute with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" is mentioned once in the grotto scene as the poet wonders if his concepts are legible to the beings, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait remains label-only; no visible tradeoff or decision follows from it. The poet's actual choices (speaking to the grotto, drawing the spiral, refusing transcendence) are not explicitly shaped by ethical playfulness. Late first appearance (middle third), ornamental use, and no closure participation all apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spiral pattern is drawn mid-story and triggers the grotto's memory-vision, a major turn that enables the poet's understanding of layered time and sets up the binary choice. The action is specific and irreplaceable—its mechanics (tracing in dust, beings responding with light) are central to the escalation. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The pattern is handled on the page, not summarized. Causal pressure is high; removing the spiral drawing would collapse the vision sequence and weaken the closure's groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled early ("to discover the texture of time"), enacted through the grotto's memory-vision (layers of rock become moments), and paid off in the closure decision (choosing to chronicle rather than transcend layered time). The method shapes the poet's understanding and thus his choice. Two distinct beats involve it: the vision sequence and the final recognition that "to know it fully was to stop feeling the friction that gave it grain." Causal link to closure is strong, though the method is more conceptual than physical, reducing specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is introduced in the opening, its clay walls and cool air anchor every beat, and the final act—writing on the clay wall with charcoal—depends on its material presence. The grotto's physical properties (curved walls that store memories, clay texture as metaphor for time) constrain and enable the poet's choice. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting is irreplaceable; a generic cave or chamber would not carry the same tactile and symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is mentioned in the opening and contextualizes the changed world, but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock is live; the poet's encounter with the beings feels untimed. The backstory mentions the prison escape ("centuries ago"), and the grotto's memories span eras, but none of this temporal layering pressures the poet's choice with deadline or scarcity. Setup is present, development is thematic rather than tactical, and closure linkage is weak. Swappable with "in a transformed world."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of time" is stated in the opening, dramatized through the poet's choice to enter the grotto and draw the spiral, and directly shapes the climactic decision (transcendence would satisfy the craving but erase the friction). The desire is conflicted—satisfaction would end the very texture he seeks. Two beats involve it: the initial wandering and the final refusal. Causal pressure is strong; the motivation narrows the poet's choice and charges the closure. Cost is visible: he foregoes omniscience to preserve embodied experience.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone blends elevated lyricism ("whorled like a fossilized fingerprint," "liquid topaz") with restraint ("slight, grateful shake of his head"). Modulation occurs as pressure builds—diction intensifies during the vision, then quiets at closure. Coherence is maintained across turns. The tone charges the final image by framing the poet's choice as both passionate (he craves understanding) and subtle (he refuses the loud transcendence). However, some phrases risk overstating the subtlety ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") rather than embodying it through rhythm and image alone. Setup and payoff are clear; development is steady.</comment>
