<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("to merge the parallel timelines") but his internal experience remains abstract throughout. His "resiliently positive" trait is asserted repeatedly without contradiction or cost—he smiles through disappearances with no embodied fear, frustration, or trade-off. The final merger happens via metaphysical mechanics (hourglass, radio, starlight) rather than a choice that forecloses a personal path, leaving character work ornamental to the concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract setup ("era when clocks ran sideways," "spectral grotto"), triggering the Q2 penalty (−0.4). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—starlight patterns, radio harmonics, and hourglass glow layer toward a merger—but the closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing ("permanent transient state, always flowing yet always whole") whose cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The final image reconfigures the premise, but no visible sacrifice or forfeited option appears in the closing beats, weakening the RR/CR landing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, starlight pathways, and radio dials supply vivid sensory anchors that recur across beats. The hourglass "drank the starlight, filling with a liquid silver glow" is a strong micro-setting moment that charges the climax. However, spatial choreography (ferry hull, wheelhouse, deck) remains vague, and the grotto itself does not constrain Kael's choices—it decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (merge timelines to stabilize the ferry and save passengers) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via phasing hull, fragmented radio voices, and vanishing outline, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The merger proceeds smoothly—radio harmonics align, hourglass fills, timelines weave—with no setback, cost, or resistance that Kael must overcome through a difficult choice. "Timelines tugging, resisting" is told but not dramatized as a credible obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "permanent transient" paradox is taught early and returns in the final paragraph with conceptual charge. The hourglass void, sideways clocks, and overlapping timelines build a coherent motif of flux as constancy. However, the ending states the theme ("permanence was an illusion; transience was the only constant") rather than letting the ferry's stabilization and immediate re-preparation embody it without overt summary, slightly dulling resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("ardent," "spectral," "metaphysical harmonics"), though several phrases verge on purple abstraction ("cavity in reality where moments bled," "liquid silver glow"). No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than character-particular: Kael notices starlight patterns and radio signals, but his way of seeing does not carry idiosyncratic bias or selective attention shaped by his history.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops appear: "vanishing...fact known to all who dared ride it" / "ferry shuddered as it phased between timelines"; "permanent transient nature of his existence" / "permanence was an illusion; transience was the only constant." Template cadence runs through the middle third: "The radio was... The hourglass began... A voice... Kael responded..." (−0.5). Elevated register ("metaphysical harmonics," "resonant feedback loop") fits voice but density suffers from synonym churn ("interconnected patterns" appears four times). Information load per sentence is moderate; momentum drags in expository beats that restate world rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The spectral-grotto ferry premise and "clocks run sideways" frame offer fresh metaphysical texture. The hourglass-as-temporal-key and radio-tuned-to-harmonics are inventive specifics. However, the core arc—technician stabilizes anomaly through patient ritual—is familiar, and the ending ("nexus, a point of convergence...always flowing yet always whole") resolves into genre-standard mystical synthesis without a sharp character or moral inflection that would make the premise feel inevitable to *this* protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kael appears in every beat and performs the merger ritual, but his choices are procedural (adjust dials, hold hourglass aloft) rather than dilemmas that alter tactics. His "ardent" commitment is asserted, not tested by a competing want or cost. Setup and development present; closure participation is operational, not decisional. Swappable with "determined technician" (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The empty hourglass is introduced early, reappears in the wheelhouse ("began to glow"), is held aloft to drink starlight (climax), and is pocketed "now dormant but ready" at the end. Three beats, with evolving function (gift → key → vessel → dormant tool). It enables the merger and charges the final image. Not quite indispensable—another object could theoretically serve—but its void-as-potential specificity is tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry frames every beat: phasing hull, translucent outline, complete disappearance, reappearance with ghost passengers. It is the problem Kael solves and the nexus he creates. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The concept shapes stakes (save scattered passengers) and closure (ferry stabilizes as "permanent transient"). Strong integration, though Kael's internal arc does not require *this* anomaly—he could stabilize any metaphysicalrift with similar tools.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is asserted three times: "greeting each disappearance with a smile," "calm assurances," "his ardent faith fueling the delicate process." It never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. No scene shows Kael suppressing doubt, paying a relational price for optimism, or forcing cheer when despair would be easier. Label-only trait (−0.6); ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radio is introduced early ("ancient radio crackled"), becomes the tool ("adjusted the dials"), creates the resonant feedback loop (middle), emits the unity pulse (climax), and "fell silent" at closure. It drives the merger mechanism across four beats. Removing it would require a different metaphysical conduit, breaking current story logic. High specificity: tuned to "metaphysical harmonics," not frequencies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Via interconnected patterns" is signaled early (starlight pathways as map, radio signals aligned with patterns), recurs in the middle ("saw the interconnected patterns in the air"), and enables the climax ("channeled these patterns...to merge the timelines"). The method is present in setup, development, and payoff, shaping how Kael executes the merger. Moderately specific; "network resonance" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5), but the pattern-matching mechanic is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under starlight is established immediately, recurs as sensory anchor (starlight patterns, "canopy of radiant threads"), and provides the closing image ("under the starlight, in the spectral grotto"). It supplies the resource (starlight) that fills the hourglass and shapes the final tableau. Setup, development, and payoff present. The grotto does not constrain a choice—Kael operates freely within it—but it is irreplaceable as the metaphysical stage and light source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is introduced early as the era-frame and recurs when "clocks that had run sideways began to slow." It thematically charges the world but does not create a visible deadline or alter Kael's tactics beat-to-beat. Time is fluid and unreliable by design, so no ticking urgency narrows options. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle development weak. Atmospheric constraint, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to merge the parallel timelines...to stabilize the ferry and save its scattered passengers") is stated early and drives every action: tuning the radio, channeling patterns, broadcasting unity. The goal shapes tactics across beats and is achieved at closure. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost that makes him hesitate—so it reads as mission rather than dramatized friction. Setup, development, and payoff present; lacks internal cost (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is introduced early ("permanent transient nature of his existence"), recurs in the climax ("permanent transient state, always flowing yet always whole"), and charges the final paragraph ("in a world of permanent transient, every merger was a moment"). The paradox modulates with the ferry's phases (vanishing/reappearing) and is crystallized in the ending image. Tone is coherent and elevates closure. Strong thematic integration; near-indispensable to the conceptual payoff.</comment>
