<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover beauty in the incomplete" is clearly established and embodied through his interaction with the boy, but his interior landscape reads slightly generic—"the familiar pull to soothe" and "warmth spreading in his chest" are functional yet lack the contradictory texture that would lift the characterization into higher bands. The boy's shift from dismay to wonder is traced cleanly, but it unfolds without friction or resistance. The poet's consistent stance (harmonizing discord) never encounters a moment where his method costs him something or meets genuine pushback, leaving the arc stable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lagoon, feather, kite-snap, and child converge to reweight Elias's poetic project by the end. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the feather returned, notebook opened, "perfectly, incompletely beautiful")—the final image reconfigures his stance with felt cost (he accepts incompleteness as material, not obstacle). One small orientation slip: the distant child's location shifts vaguely ("distant shore" → "approached") without clear spatial bridging. The lens holds, but the tightening is more accumulative density than narrowed options, keeping this in the mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon and its "burnished hush" anchor the scene vividly, and sensory detail (wet stone, salt, shattered glass surface) filters cleanly through Elias's attentive POV. The feather's "filaments like woven dawns" and the kite as "sudden silent blot" charge the final image with recurring color/light motifs. The feather itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the exchange and charging closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the child's movement from "distant shore" to close proximity compresses without marked transition, a minor slip that prevents entry to the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's poetic project of harmonizing discord—is signaled early and tested when the kite breaks free, but the test itself is gentle: he walks toward the sound, offers the feather, and succeeds without friction. The boy's acceptance unfolds smoothly, with no resistance or second turn that would narrow options or raise cost. One meaningful tightening occurs (the kite-snap crystallizes the moment), yet the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by agency under pressure. The resolution is thematically apt but lacks a visible price or foreclosed path, capping this category below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the incomplete, discord into harmony) emerges organically from the lagoon, feather, and kite rather than from direct statement. The final image—"perfectly, incompletely beautiful"—reweights prior fragments without moralizing, and the phrase "woven dawns" recurs with earned resonance. However, the thematic answer is telegraphed early and restated rather than deepened under pressure: "what breaks free shows us a new kind of beauty" announces the conclusion before the ending earns it through friction. The piece resists overt sermonizing but flirts with thesis-articulation ("attention weaves the world whole"), a minor drag on an otherwise strong thematic execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (warm attentiveness, poetic diction) is consistent throughout. Dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven ("It's gone," "Sometimes what breaks free..."), carrying subtext without forced exposition. The prose rhythm modulates gently with the kite-snap beat, but under peak pressure the voice does not compress or intensify—syntax and register remain steady rather than reflecting urgency. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the familiar pull," "knew he would write") slightly dull immediacy in a few beats, though they remain voice-motivated and do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is clear and mostly propulsive, but several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("His poetry was made of such woven dawns, each poem a tapestry of lost and found moments" restates "woven dawns of his life grew richer by one more thread"), template cadence runs ("He would tend that song, by harmonizing discord, into lines on a page" echoes prior phrasing without added pressure), and stock metaphors ("threads he would use to weave," "tapestry of lost and found"). The phrase "by harmonizing discord" appears three times in identical or near-identical form, functioning as a thematic tag rather than evolving syntactically. These loops and scaffold sentences dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.9 baseline in Q7), with additional drag from the closure beat being touched by template phrasing ("He would tend that song, by harmonizing discord"). High information density in the opening and sensory specificity prevent this from falling below 6.0, but line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the cross-caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—shoreline poet finds beauty in fragments, comforts child who loses kite—is warm and competently executed but follows a well-worn template: wise figure transforms loss into lesson via symbolic object. The "woven dawns" metaphor and drake's tail feather offer texture, yet the emotional arc (dismay → wonder) and the poet's unwavering competence avoid risk or complication. The transformation test flags concern: swap names and setting, and the plot and emotional beats hold unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes; the piece opts for gentle synthesis over fresh inflection, landing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his choices (kneel, lift feather, approach boy, offer feather, accept it back) drive each beat. His decision to gift the feather creates the key turn (boy's shift from dismay to wonder), and his final choice to place the feather in his notebook closes the loop. However, his stance never wavers or faces friction—he observes, decides, acts, and succeeds without cost or constraint tied to being a poet. The character is functional and legible but ultimately replaceable with any compassionate figure; "quiet shoreline poet" does not supply unique pressure or tactics. Present in setup, middle, and closure (all three gates), but causal pressure is moderate and specificity is low (−0.6 for swappability). Band guidance places this at ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather is discovered in the first third, examined ("filaments like woven dawns"), offered to the boy, returned to Elias, and placed in his notebook at closure—present across at least four distinct beats. It enables the middle choice (comforting the boy) and charges the final image (bookmark between silences). Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), and specificity (iridescent, curved, filaments) earn strong integration. However, the feather does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it functions as gift and symbol rather than problem or pressure. No swappability penalty (its unique properties matter), but the absence of felt trade-off or cost keeps this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears as a poetic phrase attached to the feather ("filaments like woven dawns"), restated as thematic claim ("His poetry was made of such woven dawns"), and invoked again at closure ("woven dawns of his life grew richer"). Present in setup and closure (two gates), but it never shapes stakes or tactics on the page—it remains a metaphor for his poetic project rather than an active constraint or method. The concept echoes theme but does not change options or narrow choices. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use can score ~5.5–6.3 when the return reweights the stake with cost; here the return is descriptive rather than pressuring (−0.7 for ornamental use, −0.5 for swappability). Band guidance places this at ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is named twice ("warmly attentive eyes," "attention warmly encompassing") and shown through Elias's noticing (shell, stick, feather) and his calm approach to the boy. The trait enables the middle choice (he sees the feather, approaches the child) but does not constrain or cost him—it is consistently facilitative rather than frictional. Present in setup and middle (two gates), functional but replaceable with any observant or compassionate descriptor. No visible tradeoff or price tied to the trait (−0.5 for lack of cost, −0.4 for swappability). Band guidance places this at ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tend" appears as verb and method throughout: "His thoughts often tended the memories," "He sought to tend the world's ragged edges," "He would tend that song," "To tend, for him, was to bind quiet miracles into understanding." The action frames his motivation and is invoked at closure, but the major turn (offering the feather) could be described as "gift," "soothe," or "harmonize" with equal accuracy—"tend" is one label among several for the same underlying gesture. Present in setup, middle (implicit in his approach), and closure (all three gates), but swappable with minor edits (−0.6). Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but moderate specificity and no unique constraint. Band guidance places this at ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By harmonizing discord" is named three times ("by harmonizing discord," "always worked by harmonizing discord," "He would tend that song, by harmonizing discord") and demonstrated in the central beat: Elias transforms the boy's dismay (discord) into wonder (harmony) via the feather. The method is signaled early and shapes the middle attempt, but its mechanics remain abstract—he simply offers the feather and speaks gently, actions that do not uniquely depend on "harmonizing discord" as opposed to "comforting" or "reframing." Present in setup, middle, and closure (all three gates), but the method is told more than dramatized with specific tactics. Early signal (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.5), but swappability and label-only use (−0.9 combined). Band guidance places this at ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail ("sheet of shattered cobalt glass," "wet stone and salt") and recurs at closure ("The lagoon glowed, a cobalt mirror for the softening sky"). The setting supplies the feather (washed up after rain) and frames the emotional tone (burnished hush), but it does not pressure choices or alter tactics—Elias could perform the same actions in any post-storm shoreline. Present in setup and closure (two gates), with lyric reprise that reweights tone but not stakes. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.5), but no causal pressure or constraint (−0.7 for ornamental postcard use). Band guidance places this at ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kite-string snap is described as "a crisp timeframe marking the instant" and functions as the inciting beat: it shifts the boy from play to dismay and draws Elias's attention. The snap is a single moment rather than a tracked duration, and no other time pressure shapes the scene—the pace is unhurried, and Elias's approach and conversation unfold without urgency. Present in setup (the snap) and implicitly at closure (the memory of liberation), meeting two gates. One beat involvement (+0.4), setup (+0.4), but no tightening of decisions or tactics (−0.5 for lack of clock pressure). Band guidance places this at ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" is stated as "lifelong motivation" in the opening and dramatized when Elias finds the fractured shell, water-smoothed stick, and shed feather—all incomplete objects. The motivation drives his approach to the boy and his final acceptance of the feather as poetic material. Present in setup, middle (shapes his choice to engage), and closure (fulfillment: "he had witnessed beauty in the incomplete"). Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but the motivation is told more than conflicted—no friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. Lack of dramatic friction (−0.5). Band guidance places this at ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is named in the opening and closing lines, and the tone (quiet, reflective, post-rain calm) remains stable throughout without modulation for the kite-snap beat or the boy's cry of dismay. The tone supports the accumulative lens and charges the final image ("In that stillness, everything was perfectly, incompletely beautiful"), but it does not shift with pressure—the narrator's calm never wavers even when the child is distressed. Present in setup and closure (two gates), with strong lyric reprise. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.0), but static mood without tonal range under pressure (−0.4). Band guidance places this at ~6.8.</comment>
