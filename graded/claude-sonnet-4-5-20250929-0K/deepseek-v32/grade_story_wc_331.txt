<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority remains abstract—"enthralled," "profoundly centered"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The scarf-ritual sequence demonstrates goal-directed action, yet the protagonist's engagement reads contemplative rather than pressured by internal conflict. The final moment ("smiled and led him") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path. No micro-choices under competing desires are dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of memory-awakening through geometry and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when Elara gains understanding that the library itself is a gateway. The cost is conceptual—she now knows the architecture but must continue custodianship rather than enter—legible in "continue her custodianship, guiding them closer, story by story." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the memory-echo teaches her the hyperbolic-plane truth, reweighting her prior searching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The non-Euclidean nook, copper compass, and hyperbolic vellum constrain the ritual action and charge the closure image ("a quiet compass pointing forever toward the infinite"). Sensory detail is selective: "fibers grew warm," "air shimmered," "rustle of silk." The library's spatial logic—shelves marrying Kepler to Keats—filters through Elara's curatorial priorities. Micro-setting (scarf, compass, table) functions as pressure-bearing environment at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to find the place where stories live." The hyperbolic-grid ritual tightens when the memory-echo reveals curvature as the answer, narrowing Elara's search into custodial stewardship. However, escalation is cognitive rather than involving live trade-offs or a choice that forecloses alternatives. The price—continuing to guide patrons rather than crossing over—is conceptual and quiet, fitting the lens but lacking visible forfeiture or competing option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hyperbolic-plane metaphor: infinite narratives coexist without overlap on a surface of negative curvature. The founder's memory-echo demonstrates rather than declares, and the final image ("tattered silk scarf...a quiet compass") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—Elara's revelation binds her to perpetual guidance rather than arrival. One slip: "stories were living things residing in a dimension adjacent to our own" edges toward meta-commentary, though the geometric proof grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "her fingers brushing the spines," "a tactile archive of analog memories not her own." Prose rhythm modulates—contemplative in the ritual, brisk during patron interactions. Filter verbs ("perceived," "watched") appear in the memory-vision beat, appropriate for the mediated experience. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent. One template note: "sanely eccentric and profoundly centered" relies on paired adjectives rather than showing the contradiction through syntax or perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high ("geometrician-poet who believed stories were living things"). Minor scaffold: "Her sanctuary was the non-Euclidean reading nook" followed immediately by description rather than action. "While patrons browsed unknowable corridors" contradicts the library's precise shelving logic mentioned earlier. Figurative language is controlled—"whispering arcs," "distant sea"—without overloading. Clarity and momentum are strong, with only occasional template cadence ("She moved...She laid...She placed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry with narrative theory is specific and non-obvious. The scarf-as-analog-memory device and the ritual using geometric resonance feel fresh within the concept-fiction tradition. Risk: embedding rigorous math in a lyric frame without explaining or dumbing down. One friction: "sanely eccentric" is a stock phrase for quirky intellectuals, and the librarian-custodian role leans toward archetype. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the logic without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her ritual choice drives the middle beat. She signals early ("odd-hour librarian"), appears in two distinct beats (guiding the student, performing the ritual), and her newfound understanding shapes the ending stance. However, her decision to continue custodianship is reflective rather than a dramatized choice with visible alternatives. Cost is conceptual—she does not cross over—but not framed as a sacrifice of competing desire on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scarf is handled in three beats: introduction as "constant companion," laid flat and aligned with the hyperbolic drawing (the ritual), and resting against her collarbone at closure as "a quiet compass." Its properties—analog memories, central tear—enable the memory-awakening and charge the final image. Removing it breaks the ritual logic and the closure metaphor. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Analog memories" shape the ritual: they are impressions in silk threads requiring hyperbolic geometry to cohere, not digital recordings. The concept governs Elara's method and the stakes—reawakening the founder's knowledge—and the memory-echo delivers the thematic answer. Present early, active in the middle beat, and implied in the closure (the scarf as compass). Specificity matters: analog versus digital differentiates this from generic memory magic. One friction: the concept could be swapped for "psychometric impressions" with modest edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is mentioned twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It is label-only characterization—"a trait the library's trustees tolerated"—without dramatized tradeoff. The attribute does not alter her ritual choices or patron interactions. Ornamental use without causal pressure or visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" structures the middle beat: Elara uses the hyperbolic grid to reawaken the scarf's dormant memories. The action is signaled ("To reawaken them fully...required the correct key"), executed on the page ("The scarf's fibers grew warm...reawakening a scene"), and delivers the thematic revelation. Removing it would break the ritual's logic. However, it could be replaced with "activate" or "summon" with minor edits, slightly reducing indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early (the reading nook), taught through the copper compass drafting "precise hyperbolic curves," and functions as the resonant lens that focuses scattered memories. The method's mechanics matter: exponentially diverging arcs and negative curvature are not ornamental but enable the ritual and deliver the thematic proof. The ending ties the scarf to this geometry ("a quiet compass"). Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage. The method could not be swapped for generic magic without breaking the story's conceptual architecture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library frames the story—shelves marrying "Kepler's laws to Keats" embody the premise—and the non-Euclidean nook provides the physical geometry that enables the ritual. The setting supplies the darkwood table, copper tool, and ambient sounds that fade during the vision. It appears in the ending as "gateway, every book a tangent point." Strong setup, active middle use (the nook's geometry is essential), and closure participation. The setting's dual nature (science + poetry) is irreplaceable for the thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" anchors the timeframe in two beats—afternoon bustle and the final patron request. The concurrent activity creates a contrast (Elara's solitude amid others) but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Time is tracked loosely—"the library's ambient sounds...faded"—and the ritual duration is unspecified. Functional atmospheric layer but no tactical pressure from the clock. Modest lyric reprise (patrons at start and close) reweights the contrast slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is stated explicitly, dramatized through the ritual, and resolved when the memory-echo teaches her the hyperbolic architecture. It shapes her ritual choices and the ending stance: she now knows and will "continue her custodianship, guiding them closer, story by story." The friction between discovery and perpetual service is implied—she does not enter the story-place—but not foregrounded as a conflicted choice with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; modest friction dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" appears early ("a figure of observed solitude, untouched by the murmured queries") and modulates: she is solitary during the ritual yet smiles and guides at the end, "sanely eccentric and profoundly centered." Tone is coherent across turns—contemplative, unhurried—and the final image charges it ("a quiet compass"). However, the tone is fairly static; no sharp shift under pressure. Purposeful consistency rather than dynamic modulation. Solid setup and closure participation without deepening escalation.</comment>
