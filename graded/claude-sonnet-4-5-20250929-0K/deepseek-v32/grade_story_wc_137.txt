<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and subsequent transformation are motivated, though the shift from "sympathetic skeptic" to believer hinges on a single vision that arrives without prior micro-choices building internal contradiction. Her interiority is specific ("sculpt space for reflection"), but the peak moment—gasping on the floor after the vision—leans on stock bodily response rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother's memory supplies emotional charge, yet Elara's own agency before transcription remains thin; she observes and receives rather than wrestling with competing impulses in scene. The final stance crystallization is legible but arrives more through mystical download than earned internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Elara's silent thread of gratitude receives a whale's resonant reply, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights her skepticism with felt cost—her rationalist frame is "fractured, then reassembled." The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: repeated transcription deepens density until the final night's exchange crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear early (tower, whale migration, tile). One meaningful tightening occurs when she transcribes and the vision floods in, narrowing her options to participation. Cost is undeniable: "terrifying truth" replaces her reflective solitude, and she becomes "part of the pattern anew." Minor slip: the vision's causality (why this year, this night?) leans on compulsion rather than motivated ellipsis, creating a small gap in because/therefore linkage even under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower—stone column on a coastal cliff, open parapet, salt wind—is vivid and purposeful, shaping Elara's ritual and solitude. The setting constrains her actions: she takes the tile to the parapet annually, and the final whale call rises from "moonlit water" far below, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (tower walls, floor, parapet heights). The tile itself functions as micro-setting, a concrete object whose warmth and patterns anchor multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("salt wind," "haunting calls," "cold, dark sea"). The tower's verticality and exposure embody her isolation and eventual openness to connection, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding connection versus maintaining skeptical isolation—is signaled early and tightens once: Elara's compulsion to transcribe the tile is the pivot that narrows options, forcing her into visionary experience. The vision itself raises emotional cost (terror, gratitude, apology), and the final whale reply validates her shift. However, escalation relies on mystical revelation rather than protagonist agency driving pressure; she receives rather than chooses under duress. The vision's content (grandmother's kindness to whale) supplies thematic weight but does not emerge from Elara's own conflicted decisions in scene. One meaningful deepening occurs, and cost is felt ("desperate, urgent edge"), yet the lack of protagonist-driven reversals keeps this in the mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—connection as "vast, quiet," reciprocal memory woven across species—emerges organically from the tile's visions and the whale's reply, never stated as thesis. The tile shifts from "beautiful artifact, nothing more" to "key for listening," a clean reprise that reweights prior material. The final image (whale call rising, "vibrating in her bones") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's question without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture: her "silent thread of gratitude" and the whale's pause carry meaning beyond declaration. Minor slip: "courageously kind" recurs as phrase rather than staying implicit, edging toward thematic echo in the final paragraph ("live courageously kind"), which flirts with overt thesis but stops short of sermonizing by anchoring in "listening world."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during vision, slightly wider during framing). Perceptual signature is selective: Elara notices "complex magic square," "low songs," "double-exposed" memory, filtering through her skeptical-then-transformed lens. Diction is mostly character-apt ("sympathetic skeptic," "sculpt space"), though "entangled memories" and "tapestry of mutual regard" edge toward elevated register in peak beats. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. Minor slip: "courageously kind" repeats verbatim across paragraphs, a template echo that slightly flattens voice texture. Narrative certainty matches what Elara can know; the vision is framed as her experience, not omniscient fact. Overall, voice is distinct and rhythm supports pressure, qualifying for high-7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (subject, clause, participial), and rhythm accelerates during the vision sequence. Clarity is strong, though figurative language clusters in the vision beat ("double-exposed," "thread of calm," "tapestry of mutual regard") without overwhelming legibility. Minor loop: "courageously kind" appears three times verbatim, a paraphrase echo that costs −0.3. Syntax is varied, and grammar is clean. The final line ("its memories, now hers, would guide her to live courageously kind in a listening world") stacks abstractions slightly, edging toward summary rather than image. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Overall, propulsion is solid with one hairline slip in the closure beat's diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—skeptic transformed by inherited mystical artifact during whale migration—combines familiar tropes (magical heirloom, animal communion, epiphany) but grounds them in specific detail (jade tile with magic square, humpback entangled in net, tower ritual). The grandmother-whale rescue memory is fresh and concrete, avoiding generic kindness templates. However, the core arc (skeptic receives mystical download and converts) is well-worn, and Elara's transformation hinges on revelation rather than a non-obvious synthesis of prior choices. The tile-as-listening-key is a purposeful twist, yet the story does not risk bold structural choices or subvert the mystical-inheritance frame. Emotional truth is present, but the ending's "listening world" phrase edges toward platitude. Solid mid-band: transformed through detail but not deeply original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her skepticism frames the opening, but her key "decision" is a compulsion to transcribe, not a choice that alters tactics. She observes, receives visions, and finally opens her mind—agency is thin. The final silent gratitude is a micro-choice, but it does not reverse prior moves or constrain options with visible cost. Present in closure (she stands at parapet, casts the thread), but her arc is more receptive than decisional. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met; middle development is weak (vision happens to her). Eligible up to ~6.0, lowered slightly for passive agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jade tile is handled in multiple beats: annual ritual, transcription, warmth in hand, held to heart at closure. It shifts meaning from "beautiful artifact, nothing more" to "key for listening," a clean reprise that reweights the stake. Early signal (first paragraph), middle beat (transcription triggers vision), and closure (held to heart, "its work was done"). Causal pressure: transcription unlocks memories, altering Elara's options. Irreplaceability is high (specific magic square, grandmother's legacy). All three gates met. Cost linkage is present (she gasps, tile warms). Strong integration, but the tile's mechanics (why this year?) are slightly under-explained, keeping it shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories are the mechanism of the vision and appear explicitly ("entangled memories, not her own, yet woven into her blood"). The concept shapes the middle beat (vision of grandmother and whale) and the final understanding ("living current in an unheard symphony of reciprocal memory"). However, it is more theme than tactic; it does not constrain Elara's choices on the page—she does not wrestle with how to access or interpret the memories. Present in setup (tile's "complex" patterns), middle (vision), and closure (she understands the pattern). Two gates strong, one weaker. Eligible for mid-6s; concept is demonstrated but not tactically pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is applied to Anya's rescue (spending hours singing, casting rope) and recurs in the final line ("live courageously kind"). The trait is demonstrated in the vision (visible cost: hours of effort, no reward) but not in Elara's own on-page actions—she receives the memory rather than enacting the trait herself. The phrase appears three times, twice as label. Setup and closure participation are met, but middle beat is Anya's, not Elara's. Swappable with "compassionate" or "selfless" without structural change. Eligible up to ~6.0, lowered for label-reliance and lack of protagonist enactment with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Transcription is the inciting action: "she decided, finally, to transcribe the tile's intricate patterns." It triggers the vision that shifts Elara's stance and drives the climax (more transcription "night after night"). The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the causal chain. Early signal (setup at ~40% mark is late but functional), middle beat (transcription unlocks memories), and closure (the tile's work is done, implying transcription complete). Cost is tied to it (vision leaves her gasping, "fractured"). Slight friction: first transcription happens suddenly ("strange compulsion"), weakening motivation. All three gates met, strong causal pressure, minor late-entry penalty. High-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The method ("through forgotten patterns of connection") is named explicitly and demonstrated: Elara traces lines "not with logic but followed a flow." The vision reveals "forgotten patterns of kinship between species," and the tile is "a key for listening." The method shapes the transcription beat and the final understanding. However, it is more atmosphere than mechanical constraint—Elara does not learn or adjust the method; it simply works. Setup and closure participation are met; middle beat shows the method in action (tracing lines). Eligible for mid-5s, lifted slightly for closure linkage. Swappable with "intuition" or "instinct" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tower is the sole setting, anchoring all action. It shapes ritual (annual migration vigil on the parapet), provides the vertical distance that makes the whale call rise "from far below," and embodies isolation ("lived alone," "sculpt space for reflection"). The open parapet allows the salt wind and whale songs to pressure Elara's senses. Spatial choreography is clean (floor, parapet, walls). The tower's height and exposure charge the final image (she stands above, whale pauses below). Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation—all three gates met. Slight friction: the tower does not constrain a choice (she could leave but does not); it is stage more than obstacle. Strong mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The whale migration timeframe is signaled early ("Each year, during the great whale migration") and recurs: "this year," "night after night, as the whales passed," "final night of the migration." It creates a loose ticking clock (migration will end) and provides the sensory trigger (whale songs). The timeframe enables the final beat (whale pauses, replies). However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Elara could transcribe at any time. Setup and closure participation are met; middle beat shows nights passing but no urgency. Eligible for ~6.0, lifted slightly for closure linkage (final night). Not irreplaceable; any annual ritual window would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to sculpt space for reflection" is stated early and frames her tower life. It shifts under pressure: "now had a desperate, urgent edge" and "to sculpt space for reflection was to make room for that connection." The motivation is demonstrated (living alone, annual ritual) and conflicted (skepticism versus grandmother's legacy). However, the friction is told more than dramatized in choices; Elara does not wrestle on-page between solitude and connection until the vision forces the shift. Setup, middle label, and closure reprise are present—all three gates met. Eligible for low-6s. Cost is implied (solitude forfeited for connection), but the trade-off is not shown as a painful micro-choice in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" is the central tonal motif: whale calls "felt like an unheard symphony," memories are "a living current in an unheard symphony of reciprocal memory," and the final line "Elara, the skeptic, finally heard the symphony." Tone is coherent—quiet, mystical, accretive—and modulates with pressure (wonder, terror, gratitude). The symphony metaphor charges the final image (whale call as "note of recognition"). Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation—all three gates met. Irreplaceability is moderate; "music" or "song" could substitute with minor edits. Strong causal linkage (hearing the symphony is the closure shift). Eligible for low-7s, lifted for closure charge.</comment>
