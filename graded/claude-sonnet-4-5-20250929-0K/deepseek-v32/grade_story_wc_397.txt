<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual shift upon waking is handled with specificity ("world settled around her," "gripped reality loosely"), and her micro-choices—staying, volunteering, listening—are rooted in a consistent internal transformation. The interior work is largely successful: her motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" generates concrete actions (trawling through disaster sites, listening to sighs and creaks). However, the final "postponement" of her own death feels slightly under-motivated; we see her witnessing the fisherman's sigh but the mechanism by which that specific sound earns her renewed purpose lacks one more concrete on-page cost or renunciation. The change is more atmospheric resonance than dramatized pivot, capping the category in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—Elara's perceptual shift, slow trawl through disaster relief, sensory accumulation—and the closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (she learns the sound, postpones her end). Orientation anchors are clear by the opening paragraph. The ending image (fisherman's sigh as "grief, acceptance, and closure") reweights prior listening, and Elara's decision to return to volunteer work constitutes Earned Stasis with a felt cost (she defers the controlled end she sought). However, the cost remains somewhat diffuse—"postpone her own" is asserted more than it is enacted through a visible foreclosure of options. The Accumulative lens holds, but the final cadence shift lacks the sharpness needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with sensory specificity ("lacework of wooden piers," "scent of pine and wet stone," "low groan of ice") and appears in nearly every beat, anchoring Elara's perceptual shifts. The setting constrains her choices implicitly—she stays in this stark northern harbor, the ice and wind mirror her internal loosening—and the parasol tip, a micro-setting object, charges the final image when she pockets it and returns to work. Spatial choreography is clean (dock, cottage, volunteer hall). The marina shapes mood and recurs with purpose, meeting the category's core tests and earning the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings—is signaled early and pursued through volunteering beats. One meaningful deepening occurs: the old woman's "fold in patience" teaches Elara that endings are layered, then the fisherman's sigh crystallizes the lesson. Agency is present but oblique; Elara's listening and observation drive the arc, yet the final "postponement" is more assertion than visible trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cadence shifts, but the cost at closure (deferring her own ending) is told rather than enacted through a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice, preventing entry into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: patience as "folds" where time pools, endings as "release" not crash, the parasol tip as beauty persisting in fragments. The piece resists overt moralizing; Elara's transformation from euthanasia tourist to witness arises through concrete sensory work (listening to sighs, touching lace, watching ice). The final image—pocketing the parasol tip, returning to volunteer work—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral. The concept of "approaching endings" reweights prior material. Minor deduction: the phrase "had found a reason to postpone her own" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image, but the overall handling is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific ("gripped reality loosely," sensory accumulation through wind and ice). Free indirect style is clean, and diction fits Elara's introspective register. The single line of dialogue ("I'm learning to hear the moments before silence") is purposeful and apt, carrying subtext without over-explanation. Minor deduction: the phrase "a particular resonance that preceded acceptance" and "the concept of 'a fold in patience' unfolded in her mind" tilt slightly toward expository summary rather than embodied perception, and the final paragraph's "such an education" reads slightly authored rather than organically voiced. Overall voice control is strong with hairline slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify, and information density is generally high (most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme). However, the piece carries noticeable loops and scaffold: "gripped reality loosely" appears twice in identical phrasing, "drift-ice marina" is repeated multiple times as a stock anchor, and several sentences restate content ("The work was a slow trawl, a careful sifting through loss" echoes "trawl through disaster relief"). The phrase "windborne solace" recurs as a motif but some mentions feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("The disaster relief work was the method, the trawl was the action...") reads mechanical. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, preventing entry into the 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—euthanasia tourist transformed by disaster relief into a listener for endings—offers a non-obvious synthesis of grief tourism, environmental crisis, and perceptual recalibration. The parasol tip as totem and "fold in patience" as conceptual inflection feel specific and earned. However, the arc (outsider finds purpose through service and defers suicide) is structurally familiar, and the final turn relies on assertion ("found a reason to postpone her own") rather than a surprise rooted in prior particulars. The piece transforms the template through sensory accumulation and setting specificity, but the emotional resolution is more meditation than ingenuity. Mid-6s reflects solid craft without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as euthanasia tourist frames the setup and her deferral decision at closure, appearing in the opening and final paragraphs. Her identity as "tourist" generates the perceptual shift and volunteer work (two beats), and the ending turn—postponing her own death—depends on this status. However, the character's choices are largely observational; the "euthanasia tourist" label does the thematic work more than it constrains on-page tactics. The element is present across beats and shapes closure participation, but agency is diffuse. Score reflects two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with modest beat involvement and lyric reprise, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in three beats: discovery in the ruined cottage (tactile handling, "feeling its history seep into her palm"), held on the dock during the listening meditation, and pocketed at closure as she returns to work. It is described as a "totem" and "physical key," and the ending image charges it as a reminder that "beauty persists even in fragments." The object is handled on the page, returns with reweighted meaning, and contributes to closure resonance. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; its role is symbolic accumulation rather than causal pressure. Score reflects all three gates (setup, development, payoff) with closure linkage but no visible cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is introduced mid-story via the old woman's three-day wait, then applied to Elara's own journey ("The fold in patience was where she now resided"). It shapes Elara's understanding—that endings are layered, not abrupt—and reappears in the penultimate paragraph as a summation. However, the concept is more thematic overlay than tactical constraint; it does not narrow options or force a choice under pressure. The element is present in two beats (setup via observation, payoff via reflection) and contributes to thematic resonance, but lacks causal pressure or visible cost. Score reflects two-gate participation with modest beat involvement, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated twice in identical phrasing (opening and mid-story) and functions as a label for Elara's perceptual shift. It enables her to "perceive these layers" and "allow for transformation," but the trait is told rather than dramatized through on-page cost or tactical trade-off. The phrase reappears in summary ("To grip reality loosely was to allow for transformation") without a visible price or constrained action. The element is present across beats but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic. Score reflects setup and thematic reprise without development or causal pressure, capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears as both literal disaster-relief action (moving through shattered homes, sifting through loss) and metaphor ("trawled for it... through disaster relief volunteering," "trawled her memory"). It frames the work Elara does in two distinct beats (volunteering, dock meditation) and shapes her method of listening. However, the action is easily swappable with "search" or "sift" without structural impact; the trawl metaphor adds texture but does not drive a key turn or constrain tactics under pressure. The element is present across beats and contributes to tone, but lacks irreplaceability. Score reflects functional use in two beats without causal necessity or closure dependency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early ("volunteer with the coastal relief corps after the severe spring floods"), drives multiple beats (bundling supplies, comforting families, listening in ruined cottage, observing the old woman, hearing the fisherman's sigh), and shapes the ending decision (returning to "the volunteer hall, ready for tomorrow's slow, patient work"). The method is specific—flood relief, not generic service—and its mechanics (moving through wreckage, listening to displaced voices) matter to Elara's perceptual education. The element constrains her actions (she stays, she listens, she works) and charges the final image. It appears in setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure and closure linkage, earning the low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is present in nearly every paragraph, anchoring sensory accumulation (ice, wind, piers, gulls) and appearing in the opening, middle listening beats, and final return to the volunteer hall. It provides atmospheric coherence and mirrors Elara's internal loosening. However, while the setting shapes mood and recurs with purpose, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as backdrop and thematic resonance rather than tactical resource. The element is deeply integrated across beats and charges the final image ("windborne solace wrapped around her"), but lacks causal necessity. Score reflects all three gates with strong closure participation but no visible cost tied to the setting itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" frames the opening and is referenced once more in the penultimate paragraph ("The change upon waking had been the beginning of this unraveling"). The timeframe marks a perceptual before/after but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed pressure. Weeks pass in summary ("Weeks passed"), and no on-page clock alters tactics. The element is present in setup and thematic reprise but does not constrain action or escalate stakes. Score reflects minimal gate participation (setup, weak payoff) without development or tactical pressure, capping it in the low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to learn the sound of approaching endings" is signaled early ("Her new motivation was obscure even to her"), drives her volunteering and listening across multiple beats (comfort work, cottage discovery, dock meditation, fisherman's sigh), and is crystallized at closure ("She had learned the sound... and that made all the difference"). The desire is dramatized through action and sensory accumulation, and friction exists between the abstract goal and the concrete, muddy work required to pursue it. The ending turn—postponing her own death—depends on this motivation. The element appears in all three gates with strong beat involvement and closure linkage, earning the low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears three times: as "wind carrying a scent" and "fragile solace" early, "windborne breath" mid-story, and "windborne solace wrapped around her" and "wind swept across the ice, carrying solace" at closure. The tone is coherent, modulates subtly with Elara's shifts (from fragile to constant companion), and charges the final image as she returns to work. However, the phrase risks ornamental repetition; its recurrence is purposeful but not causally necessary. The element is present across beats and contributes to thematic resonance and closure mood, but does not constrain choice or escalate pressure. Score reflects all three gates with closure linkage but modest tactical impact, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>
