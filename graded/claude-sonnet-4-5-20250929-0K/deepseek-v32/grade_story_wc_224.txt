<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes cleanly from abstract grief to concrete action: "The shape of home was not a static place, but a pattern in the chaos." Her final choice—letting a drop of mercury fall as seed—emerges from prior causality and carries visible cost (she gives from her essence). Interior contradictions are present but muted; the seer's loss reads more as elegant melancholy than embodied struggle under pressure. Minor slip: "buried talents" as explicit interiority ("The concept of buried talents haunted her") edges toward label-speak, though the subsequent tactile discovery partially dramatizes it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal undertones. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into genesis moment): the silver drop is both action and conceptual repricing of her identity. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Vault, Elara, mercury-glass seer, retreat motive). One meaningful deepening occurs when texture translates to navigation, then tightens again at the earth chamber. Cost is legible in the final image: she gives "from her own essence," foreclosing her former identity as passive vessel. No causality breaks; the nightly shifts and tactile alphabet cohere under established world rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bookstore's nightly metamorphosis directly constrains Elara's journey: she "could not retrace," only move forward, forcing reliance on the stone's texture-map. The feather's tactile hierarchy (soft barbs, sleek shaft, sharp tip) charges the final glyph-reading and enables the climax. Micro-setting (stone in palm, earth patch, mountain roots) anchors each turn. Sensory selection is purposeful—petrichor, old glue, hidden thunder—and filtered through a seer's residual certainty. Minor gap: the labyrinth's physical layout remains impressionistic; we lack spatial choreography during the descent, though the lyric design may excuse this.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding "the shape of home" within herself. One clear tightening: frustration mounts over inert glyphs until touch (feather texture) unlocks the method, narrowing her path to descent. A second deepening: the final glyph ("seed") reframes her buried talent from vision to genesis, altering her self-concept and enabling the climactic act. Agency is protagonist-driven; the resolution (planting the silver drop) is earned by her tactile discovery and carries visible cost—she gives from her essence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (finding the stone) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the tactile alphabet, the nightly-shifting bookstore, the seed. The final image ("quiet, thunderous potential") answers the central question without stating a moral, reweighting "buried talent" from loss to genesis. Subtext operates in the contrast between mercury-glass hardness and liquid silver at the end. The feather's texture and the stone's glyphs function as motifs that constrain choice and charge closure. Minor reservation: "buried talents" is named explicitly in reflection, edging toward prompt echo, though the dramatized reversal (seer → planter) rescues thematic specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; POV remains with Elara throughout. Diction is consistent and voice-particular: "mercury-glass," "quicksilver," "hidden thunder." Perceptual signature is selective—she notices texture and resonance—though it could press harder under peak stress. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "The concept of buried talents haunted her" briefly shifts into exposition-voice, and the final line's "quiet, thunderous potential" straddles lyricism and slight over-articulation. Free indirect style is clean overall, and the prose reflects the character's contemplative register without filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Information density is high in the descent sequence. Two local artifacts lower the score: "Remembering the torrent of futures she once interpreted had become a sharp, crystalline pain" stacks nominalizations and metaphor without concrete action; "The concept of buried talents haunted her" is scaffold-like, stating theme rather than showing. A paraphrase near the opening: "to forget remembering" and "the shape of the home she had lost within herself" restate her retreat without added pressure. The final image ("quiet, thunderous potential") borders on oxymoron-stacking. No loops touch closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for these distinct issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tactile-reading twist (feather texture decodes glyphs) is specific and non-obvious, and the reversal from seer to planter arrives with hindsight logic. The mercury-glass protagonist and the nightly-shifting bookstore combine familiar elements (liminal libraries, lost seers) into a fresh synthesis. Risk: the lyric, elision-heavy structure succeeds without obscuring closure. Countering: "lost language stone" and "buried talents" are well-worn SFF/fantasy-prompt tropes, and the ending's "seed" metaphor, while earned, leans toward symbolic convenience. The transformation is present but not radical; the piece executes its premise at a high level without subverting expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive two key turns: (1) stroking the stone with the feather unlocks the tactile method, altering her tactics; (2) kneeling to release the silver drop is the climactic decision that redefines her identity. She appears in every beat and the closure hinges on her agency. Early signal (paragraph one), middle development (feather discovery), and closure participation (seed act) all present. Cost is visible: she gives from her essence. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stone appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the alcove, days of study, and the descent where its glyphs guide navigation and culminate in the final "seed" glyph. It constrains her journey (she must decode it to navigate) and enables the climax (the final glyph reframes her power). Early signal, middle development across multiple attempts, and closure participation (final glyph read) all present. The stone is causally indispensable and its specific properties (tactile glyphs) matter. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Buried talents" is named explicitly in reflection ("The concept of buried talents haunted her"), signaling the stake. It shapes her motivation and the central question. The resolution—discovering her talent is for planting futures, not seeing them—directly addresses the concept. However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint; it does not narrow tactical options in the middle. Present in setup and payoff, with some middle pressure (frustration over inert glyphs), but the work is largely conceptual rather than causal. Lyric reprise with cost at closure; solid mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nightly reality-substitution is established early ("shelves of grimoires would migrate…new wings…would unfold") and directly constrains Elara's navigation: "You could not retrace your steps, only move forward." This pressure forces her reliance on the stone's texture-map during the descent. The trait appears in setup, middle (her nightly wandering), and closure (she walks "as the shelves slithered and groaned"). It is causally active, alters tactics under stress, and is irreplaceable. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seed action is the story's climax and closure image: "from her own essence, she let a single, shimmering drop of liquid silver fall onto the earth. It was a seed." The final glyph on the stone decodes to "seed," making this the culmination of the entire quest. Removing it would collapse the ending. The action redefines Elara's identity (seer → genesis agent) and carries visible cost (she gives from herself). Introduced late but as the answer to prior setup; high causal pressure and closure indispensability. All three gates satisfied with peak irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The feather appears as a bookmark, then becomes the decoding tool in the pivotal middle beat: "she ran the feather's vane over the stone's first glyph. The texture translated." Its specific mechanics (soft barbs, sleek shaft, sharp tip) enable three readings and shape the entire descent. Present in middle and closure (final glyph read via "the feather's sharp, tiny tip"). The method is signaled, demonstrated, and essential to unlocking the path. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing the feather would break the story's logic. All gates satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is established early and present throughout. It supplies the stone (discovery site), constrains navigation (nightly shifts prevent retracing), and houses the final chamber where the seed is planted. The setting is causally active across setup, development (wandering the stacks, descending through thematic layers), and closure (central chamber with exposed roots and earth). Spatial specificity matters: the alcove, the rearranging corridors, the mountain's roots. High irreplaceability and closure linkage; the story's logic requires this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" frames the opening and motivates Elara's retreat to the Vault. The timeframe is past-tense-anchored (she "had retreated," visions "had hardened") and continues into her present nightly wandering. The pain of memory is referenced in the inciting reflection and subtly present in her frustration ("days" of study). However, the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions under live pressure; it is more origin than constraint. Setup and thematic echo present; moderate integration with some cost tied to motivation, but swappable phrasing could convey similar loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to understand the shape of the home she had lost within herself") is stated early and drives her nightly wandering. It crystallizes midway: "The shape of home was not a static place, but a pattern in the chaos." The resolution directly answers this need: she finds home in genesis potential. Present in setup, developed through her study and descent, and resolved at closure. The desire is dramatized through choices (holding the stone, studying glyphs, descending) and carries cost (she must give from herself). Strong causal thread and closure participation; slight deduction for the motivation being partly told rather than shown in contradictory friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears explicitly in the second paragraph ("a tone of hidden thunder, a low, constant pressure") and recurs in the final line ("quiet, thunderous potential"). The tone coheres across beats: thick silence, petrichor, groaning shelves, and the resonance in her glass core all sustain the charged-anticipation register. The tone modulates appropriately (mounting frustration → trembling discovery → quiet culmination) and charges the final image. Early signal and closure reprise present with purposeful recurrence. Solid integration; the exact phrasing's lyricism slightly reduces irreplaceability, but the tonal throughline is strong.</comment>
