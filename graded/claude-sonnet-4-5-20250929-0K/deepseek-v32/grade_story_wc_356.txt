<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and his internal arc from frantic control to acceptance is dramatized through concrete actions (adjusting the terrarium, sitting in stillness). The transformation is earned by the seed's dormancy forcing a shift. However, the interiority leans toward abstraction ("ambition tempered into stewardship") and the embodied contradiction could be sharper in peak beats—frustration is told more than shown through specific contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through olfactory shifts and Kaelen's escalating adjustments until the pattern breaks with acceptance, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he stops forcing and witnesses). Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: ambition is renounced for attentiveness. The who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. One meaningful deepening is present when he shifts from intervention to witness, reweighting his stake. The cost is felt but somewhat diffuse across the final paragraphs rather than concentrated in a single image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The treetop village, terrarium, and seed provide a coherent micro-setting. The terrarium constraints shape Kaelen's daily adjustments and the storm's arrival enables the turning point, satisfying the choice-constraint test for 9-band eligibility. Sensory detail (olfactory tracking, "moist breath") is purposeful and POV-filtered. However, the village itself remains atmospheric backdrop—"whispering leaves," "water clocks"—without pressing a concrete choice, and spatial choreography within the canopy home is vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (cultivate the seed/serenity) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seed's dormancy and Kaelen's frantic efforts, then reverses when he accepts stillness and opens the terrarium to the storm—a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost (renouncing control). The tightening is meaningful and the price (ambition replaced by witness) is legible on the page. Agency is clear in the moment of non-intervention, though the final paragraphs summarize years rather than sustaining immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom beneath striving, serenity within motion) emerges from events and the seed's silent instruction. The final image of growth "in peace" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, lines like "wisdom flows beneath striving, accessible only in quietude" and "true bloom had already happened within" veer into explicit thematic statement rather than letting the particulars speak. The wrapping-paper custom recurs but feels more ornamental than causally charged at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory primacy, lyric cadence). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("funereal scent," "tide's thought"). No head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully from close observation to reflective summary. Minor slip: "His current obsession was a single, wrinkled orb" reads slightly filtered/expository for the lyric mode, and the final paragraph's summary compression ("years later") loosens immediacy without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary. Information density is generally high. However, multiple phrases loop conceptually: "mysterious" appears twice in opening/closing about the village; "turning of the tide's thought" recurs identically without reweighting; "ambition" and "serenity" are restated in varied phrasing across paragraphs without new detail. Stock phrases ("profound attentiveness," "gentle precision") and elevated diction in summary beats ("arboreal world," "perpetual motion") slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 per the non-closure accumulation rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The herbalist-seeking-wisdom frame is familiar, and the corpse-flower obstacle is a fresh specific. The wrapping-paper custom adds texture but doesn't transform the arc. The olfactory-sensitivity angle and "tide's thought" village detail offer some freshness, yet the emotional arc (striving → acceptance) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious synthesis or risky turn. The ending's peace-through-witness insight is earned but predictable. Transformation test: plot and arc would work largely unchanged with a different seed and village.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's herbalist ambition drives the setup (seeking the seed's bloom), the middle crisis (frantic adjustments), and the ending turn (choosing stillness over control). His choices—adjusting the terrarium, then sitting and opening it to the storm—create the key beats and closure. Removing the ambition would collapse the story's stakes and arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is present in setup (gift from wanderer), development (dormancy driving Kaelen's adjustments and olfactory tracking), and payoff (shoot emergence, final bloom). It constrains his tactics (terrarium tuning) and its dormancy forces the pivot to acceptance. The seed's specific properties (scent shifts, stress-cycle needs) are irreplaceable. The shoot's emergence charges the closure moment with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Undercurrent of wisdom" shapes the thematic stakes and the final realization ("wisdom flows beneath striving"). It subtly informs Kaelen's shift from forcing to witnessing. However, it operates more as interpretive theme than a concrete choice-driver; the seed's dormancy and his own frustration push the turn more directly. Present across beats but not indispensable to plot logic—could be reframed with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity enables Kaelen to track the seed's scent shifts ("decay to something greener," "crisp electric tang"), guiding his adjustments and signaling the storm moment. It appears in setup, middle tracking, and the rain-detection beat. Constraint and cost are mild: he alone can track it, but no visible trade-off or price is shown on the page. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable—visual cues could substitute with modest rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Journalizing frames the setup (family custom, spiral drawing), recurs in development (documenting shifts), and appears at the turning point (final entry on wrapping paper). The action signals his process and marks the pivot to acceptance. It shapes two distinct beats and contributes to closure mood. However, the bloom itself is driven more by his stillness than by writing; the journal could be swapped for another ritual with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wrapping-paper custom is signaled early ("family's custom," "scribbled with protective doodles") and recurs at the turning point (final entry "on a wrapping-paper scrap doodled with a single, unfurling frond"). It adds texture and ties to the closure mood. However, its mechanics don't constrain choices—any journal surface would serve the same plot function. Present in setup and payoff (lyric reprise) but swappable, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The treetop village is named early and provides atmospheric anchoring ("canopy's eternal green," "water clocks"). The terrarium (micro-setting) does constrain action. Yet the village itself—its mysterious suspension, the water clocks marking "tide's thought"—remains backdrop without pressing a concrete choice or altering tactics. Setup is clear, middle and closure participation are ornamental. Functional but replaceable with another remote setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Turning of the tide's thought" is signaled early (water clocks chiming) and recurs at the pivot beat ("next turning found him still"). It establishes rhythm and marks the moment of decision. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten pressure—Kaelen could act at any chime. No live clock forces urgency. Present in setup and one key beat with lyric reprise, but mechanics don't alter tactics. Mid-band for recurring signal without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to "cultivate serenity within motion" is introduced early (spiral symbolizing the motivation), drives the middle conflict (frantic efforts betray the goal), and is fulfilled in the ending (calm attentiveness, "serenity...in the hush of his own actions"). The friction between wanting serenity and acting frantically is dramatized on-page. His realization and shift in tactics flow directly from this motivation. Essential to the arc and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" tone is present early ("wildflower hush of his canopy home, a silence so deep it hummed") and returns in the ending ("quiet field of wildflowers flourishing in the hush"). The lyric, contemplative register is coherent through turns. It modulates slightly—calm to frustrated to calm—but remains static in mood rather than charging the final image with new pressure. Purposeful early–final reprise reweights the stake enough for mid-6s, but the tone doesn't deepen under peak stress.</comment>
