<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The locksmith remains abstract throughout—motivation is told ("improbable longing") rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. No embodied emotion appears; the character observes fear as "a formless, pressing presence" without visceral reaction or internal conflict. The philosopher's hair provides backstory but the protagonist's present stance never shifts through dramatized cost. Agency reads as ceremonial performance rather than choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words, avoiding the penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and secrets toward a closure that should reweight meaning. However, the climactic "letting go" of the ribbon resolves fear instantly without prior friction or visible cost—fear "rallied" then "ceased abruptly" with no on-page consequence to the locksmith. The idea floats free, but what path was foreclosed? No legible price appears in the final image, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus and starlight provide vivid sensory anchors. Vega's appearance and the flat stone at the crossing supply concrete details, and the ribbon's release into the breeze uses the environment. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—the locksmith could perform the ritual anywhere with minimal adjustment. The stone and starlight charge the atmosphere but do not narrow his tactical options or alter the ending's stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the idea—is signaled early. Yet no escalation occurs: the locksmith faces no meaningful obstacle, recites secrets, fear recoils in confusion, he releases the ribbon, and the idea floats free. The "screaming wind" dissolves without cost or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or the cadence should shift to reweight options; instead, the sequence is additive and frictionless. No agency-driven tightening appears, and the resolution lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>A coherent theme of unity versus fear emerges through images (the lock of hair, the ribbon, the star's hint). The final lines attempt resonance: "enveloped secrets now simply truths wandering the world." However, the ending asserts the idea's freedom without dramatizing what was risked or lost—no non-literal answer reweights prior material. The locksmith's "fulfillment too vast to hold" is told emotion without scene pressure. Thematic threads remain decorative rather than integral to closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("hush of cosmic possibility," "shadows stretching like hungry fingers"). However, elevated register pervades high-pressure beats without modulation—"formless, pressing presence," "disoriented utterly by this surrender"—reading as uniform rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("he watched," "he saw," "he felt") cluster in the climax without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings differ. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The enveloped secrets were fully released, weaving into the cool night air. / He saw the idea then…" restates release without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "He placed…/ With gentle hands, he untied…/ A low hum filled…/ From the shadows, fear manifested…" Figurative language ("shadows stretching like hungry fingers," "idea…like a flower") appears in most sentences of the climax without pattern payoff, applying the density penalty (−0.5). No loops touch closure directly, capping deduction at −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise—metaphysical locksmith freeing an abstract idea—gestures toward originality but executes as allegory with transparent stand-ins (fear as formless presence, idea as geometric light). The core turn (letting go to unlock) echoes familiar spiritual-release templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Vega's hint and the philosopher's hair add specific anchors, yet the emotional arc and ritual structure could swap into any meditation-on-release story with minor edits. The derivative-premise guardrail applies (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The locksmith is present throughout and makes the final choice to release the ribbon. Setup is clear in the first paragraph. He speaks secrets aloud (middle development) and performs the letting-go act that completes the task (closure participation). However, his decisions do not create meaningful turns—fear's dissolution follows mechanically from his actions without surprise or cost. The character enables the plot but remains functionally interchangeable with any ritual performer. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability −0.7 and ornamental interiority −0.6 yield mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lock of hair appears in the first third (setup). The locksmith places it on the stone and unties the ribbon (middle beat), then releases the ribbon into the breeze (closure act). The object's physical handling drives two distinct beats and the final gesture. However, the hair itself is passive; the ribbon does the causal work. Removing the hair and keeping only the ribbon would not break story logic. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but swappability for ribbon alone −0.6 and summary-only philosopher backstory −0.4 cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Enveloped secrets frame the task in paragraph one and recur when the locksmith "drew the object" and later "released" them into the air. The concept shapes the middle beat (untying reveals secrets) and charges the ending ("enveloped secrets now simply truths"). Yet the secrets function thematically rather than tactically—they are recited without friction or cost. The concept is present across setup, development, and closure, but its mechanics remain abstract. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but thematic-only use without choice constraint −0.8 yields mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is labeled in paragraph one ("appeared unassumingly bold") and echoed at the end ("unassumingly bold, forever longing"). The trait is told twice but never dramatized through a choice with visible cost. The locksmith advances without threat, but no scene shows him weighing boldness against caution or paying a price for understatement. Label-only use −0.8, no beat involvement or causal pressure, caps the score low despite lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Disorient" is introduced as tactic in the middle third: "His words were designed to disorient, to break the concentration of the dread." The action succeeds immediately—fear fragments into "disjointed whispers" and the wind later becomes "disoriented utterly." The verb drives the turn from static fear to dissolution. However, the action is summary-declared rather than shown through具体 speech rhythm or contradictory truths that would embody disorientation. Middle-beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only execution −0.6 and late first mention (second third) −0.3 yield mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method is seeded early: "The first star seen at twilight would grant him a hint." Vega appears and delivers the cryptic instruction that governs the resolution. The hint shapes the locksmith's tactic (keeping vs. letting go) and the final act obeys it explicitly. Setup clear +0.7, one beat (Vega's appearance) +0.4, closure linkage strong +1.4, causal pressure +1.0. However, the hint arrives passively and is obeyed without friction—no failed interpretation or cost. Swappability for any oracle device −0.5 limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus is named in the opening line and described with vivid detail (crossroads, deepening sky, starlight). The flat stone at the center serves as stage for the ritual. Setting is present across all three gates and colors the atmosphere. However, it does not constrain choice—the locksmith could perform the ritual in any symbolic location with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, closure participation (starlight in final image) +0.8, but ornamental use without tactical pressure −0.9 and swappability −0.6 yield low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" appears as framing phrase in paragraphs one and near the end. The timeframe is poetic and vague—no on-page clock tightens decisions. Twilight progression (sky purpled, star appeared) marks atmospheric change but does not impose urgency or alter the locksmith's moves. The element is present in setup and closure as mood phrase but never develops into a constraint. Lyric reprise +0.4, but no beat involvement, no causal pressure, and ornamental function −1.0 cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph one ("to free an idea trapped behind fear") and recalled at the end ("improbable longing ached…from fulfillment"). It frames the task and explains the protagonist's presence. The locksmith's actions (speaking secrets, releasing the ribbon) pursue this goal. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no moment shows what he risks or sacrifices. Told-only friction −0.8 and no on-page trade-off −0.5 yield mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" is named in paragraph one and recurs in the final lines ("improbable longing ached in his chest"). The tone colors the opening and ending but remains static—no modulation under pressure. The locksmith's calm throughout the confrontation with fear does not inflect with longing; the emotion is asserted, not felt in syntax or image choice. Lyric reprise +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, but single static mood without charge to the final image −0.9 and label-only presence −0.6 yield low-mid band.</comment>
