<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is articulated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("legacy of cried wolves," "inheritance a curse of disbelief") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the lattice and speaking aloud feels declarative rather than earned through prior causal struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; the "acceptance" resolution arrives without dramatized internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening third without clear anchoring by ~120 words (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via acceptance and lattice placement, but cost remains abstract—"sustained impossibilities" and "new truth" are asserted rather than felt on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, copperlight motif), yet the final image does not visibly reweight prior stakes or foreclose options with legible price. Causality is present but linkage between beats is loose, relying on atmospheric transition rather than motivated choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight repose create vivid atmosphere with selective sensory detail (sea spray, salt of years, amber gloom). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the protagonist's ascent in a way that costs him options. The lattice's glow "chasing hush into every corner" charges the final image modestly, crossing the threshold for basic payoff but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to thread the labyrinth with his own story"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The climb and lattice placement feel like execution of a predetermined plan rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options. "Before they find the bodies" recurs as a timeframe marker but never tightens on-page; no reversal or visible cost forecloses a live alternative. Escalation reads as spatial (upward movement) rather than a deepening that alters knowledge or forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the son-of-lies frame and the tension between truth and myth, sustained through motifs (wolves, lattice, hush). However, the ending's thematic payoff—"his story now sustained the impossibilities"—is stated rather than dramatized through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The confession scene ("I am the son of lies, chasing hush after a lifetime of noise") reads as overt thematic statement rather than subtext. No persistent ambiguity or counter-reading; the resolution feels tidily moralized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("copperlight repose," "tactile guide," "ghost of intent") that remains coherent but risks uniform texture across beats—high and low pressure moments sound similar. Perceptual signature is present (scuffs tell stories, shadows move like bodies) but the voice does not modulate rhythmically under stress. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Recurring phrase structures create template cadence: "chasing hush" (×3), "before they find the bodies" (×3), "thread the labyrinth" (×4), "copperlight repose" (×3), "sustained impossibilities" (×3). Paraphrase loops appear ("hover" / "hovering" in adjacent beats; "the lattice from confessional" described identically across paragraphs). Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching or payoff—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction that does not vary with scene pressure. Applying template-cadence (−0.5), paraphrase-loop (−0.2), and density without modulation (−0.4) = −1.1 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The son-of-the-boy-who-cried-wolf premise offers a fresh angle, and the lighthouse-as-prison image is specific. However, the emotional arc and plot beats (climb, confession, lattice revelation) follow a familiar quest-for-redemption template without transformation through unexpected choice or trade-off. The ending's "acceptance" and silence achieve a resolution that feels conceptually neat rather than surprising or inevitable in hindsight. Specificity in setting partially rescues the score, but the turn lacks bold risk or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The son is present throughout but makes no key on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. His climb and lattice placement feel pre-scripted; the spoken confession is declarative rather than a choice under pressure. Setup and development are present, but closure participation is passive observation of his own resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears early (confessional relic in pocket), pulses mid-ascent as he climbs, and is placed on the table at the pinnacle where it glows and "mapped the labyrinth." Three distinct beats with evolving function; it enables the closure image. However, the mechanics of how it "maps" remain abstract, and the protagonist's choice to place it does not feel constrained by the lattice's specific properties—any symbolic object could serve. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Chasing hush is mentioned repeatedly as a thematic label and frames the protagonist's goal. It does not constrain an on-page choice or tactic; the narrative does not show how pursuing silence alters his approach to the climb or lattice use. The concept functions as atmospheric shorthand rather than a live stake that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lighthouse twice and echoed in the ending ("his story now sustained the impossibilities"). The trait is described but never leveraged—no on-page action depends on the lighthouse's ability to hold time or manifest lies as bodies. Label-only with thematic echo; no causal pressure or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Hover/hovering appears twice, once as threshold hesitation and once as watching the lattice. Neither instance drives a turn or redefines options; the action is ornamental—easily replaced by "paused" or "waited" without structural change. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrow door with scuffs is signaled early ("hidden behind a rusted grate") and its marks guide the ascent. The protagonist follows scuffs upward, giving the method two beats of involvement. However, the door's mechanics (why it was left ajar for decades, what the scuffs encode) remain vague, and the choice to use it feels unopposed—no cost or constraint tied to this specific means. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef anchors atmosphere and provides vertical structure for the climb. The setting enables the beam that "paints shadows that defied geometry" and the copperlight repose motif. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist's ascent is unimpeded, and the reef/waves function as backdrop. Solid closure linkage (final room at the pinnacle) but no micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" recurs three times but never tightens decisions on the page. No countdown, no consequences for delay, no live clock that forces the protagonist to choose speed over thoroughness. The timeframe is told-only and does not alter tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Threading the labyrinth with his own story is signaled early, repeated at mid-climb, and articulated in the confession ("to thread the labyrinth with his own story, he placed the lattice"). The desire shapes the goal but lacks on-page friction—no moment where the cost of telling his story conflicts with another want (escape, silence, safety). Present across beats with closure participation, but desire is not dramatized under contradictory pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Copperlight repose appears early, mid-climb, and at closure ("settled into a permanent dusk"). The tone remains static—no modulation with pressure; the lyric, contemplative register holds uniformly across ascent and ending. The final reprise reweights slightly (permanence vs. transience) but does not charge the image with new cost or meaning. Functional reprise without dynamic range.</comment>
