<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—repaying a debt across lifetimes—but her interiority remains generic and elevated throughout. The vision device triggers instant understanding without struggle or contradictory impulse. The final choice to release Lyra arrives smoothly, without visible internal conflict or a hierarchy of competing values at the moment of decision. Embodied emotion is largely absent; sadness is "tears warming her cheeks," and complexity collapses into "mournful elation" labels rather than contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative accents (vision → understanding → chant → reversal). Closure lands on the page as Lyra fades and the fields heal, a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is stated—Lyra's anchor is lost—but felt impact is muted; Elara stands "filled with a mournful elation" rather than enacting a visible renunciation or forfeiture. The vision provides instant knowledge and the carved bead solves the problem it did not help create earlier, weakening earned escalation. Orientation is prompt: who, where, and when are clear within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are vividly sketched with "starless void," "luminous flora," and "frost etched intricate patterns." The carved stone bead constrains Elara's choices—she must use it to awaken the orchard—and charges the final image as it warms in her hand. However, spatial choreography during the climax is vague: we don't see her handling specific plants or moving through the rows, only abstract "threads of energy weaving." Sensory selection narrows appropriately during the vision and final ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying the debt to Lyra—is signaled early and tightens when Elara learns the orchard can reverse the curse at the cost of Lyra's anchor. However, the vision delivers instant understanding without a struggled discovery, and the carved bead appears late (midpoint) to resolve a problem it did not shape. The final choice arrives without visible friction; Elara "understood" and proceeds smoothly. One meaningful pressure point exists—releasing Lyra—but the escalation lacks protagonist agency in earlier beats; most turns are triggered by Lyra's guidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—debts of love and the cost of release—emerges from the premise and final image (the warm bead, verdant fields). The ending avoids moralizing, allowing "some debts, once paid, become legends woven into the very earth" to resonate as earned image rather than thesis. However, "lovingly venomous nostalgia," "mournful elation," and "resonant awakenings" are prompt-label phrases that intrude repeatedly, acting as thematic shorthand rather than embodied discoveries. The carved bead's warmth and the dawn are non-literal answers, but the path feels more delivered than wrestled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Lyra's two dialogue lines carry distinct otherworldly cadence ("You remember," "This is the culmination"), but Elara's interiority defaults to elevated diction ("bittersweet sting," "weight of centuries") that feels writerly rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates slightly under pressure—shorter sentences during the vision—but perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices beauty and memory without idiosyncratic bias. Dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or timeline breaks. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Each visit was fleeting, but each left…"; "Over the following days… Each moment was fleeting, but Elara clung…"; "The ghost bride appeared again… appeared at her side… would appear." Figurative language clusters without pattern payoff: "whisper," "mist," "wind through dead leaves," "stolen starlight" stack in adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("ached with memory," "threads of energy weaving") and prompt-label phrases ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation," "resonant awakenings") reduce texture to formula. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—past-life lovers, alchemical greenhouse, debt repaid across time—follows a familiar paranormal-romance template without fresh transformation. The carved bead as memory key, the vision flashback, and the self-sacrifice ending are well-executed genre moves but lack a non-obvious angle. Specific detail is present (dreamvine, runes pulsing) yet the emotional arc and resolution feel median: love, loss, release. The "endless night" lifting at dawn is a clear symbolic beat, but the story does not surprise or reweight expectations established by the prompt elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra appears in three beats: initial cameos, the substantial appearance post-vision, and guiding Elara during the ritual. Her choice to infuse the plants and fade drives the climax. Her decision to accept release is stated but not dramatized as a struggle; she smiles and proceeds. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal role in the ending, but her agency is mostly cooperative rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The carved stone bead appears at midpoint, triggers the vision (beat one), and is held/chanted during the final ritual (beat two). It returns warm in Elara's hand at closure, reweighted as the anchor of their bond. Early signal is absent (−0.4), but causal pressure is strong: it unlocks knowledge and enables the climax. Irreplaceable—no generic object could substitute—and linked to cost (Lyra's release). Late arrival and ornamental final mention cap the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is mentioned three times: the bead triggers one, the plants undergo them during the chant, and the phrase recurs at the climax. It shapes the climax tactic (chanting runes awakens the orchard) and is linked to the outcome (fields heal). However, it functions mostly as a thematic label rather than a constraint that narrows options or creates visible cost. Present in setup (vision), development (learning the orchard's purpose), and closure (the symphony of light), but mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" appears twice as a descriptor for nostalgia and Lyra's touch. It colors atmosphere but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told, not shown through contradictory behavior. Ornamental use; easily swappable with another oxymoronic descriptor. No causal pressure or closure linkage beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Ghost" (verb and state) drives the structure: Lyra ghosts through the greenhouse repeatedly, her ephemeral form is the core mystery, and she "ghosted closer" and "ghosted through" at the climax, infusing the plants. The action is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the haunting premise and the means of resolution. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal across all beats. Specificity is high (ashen veil, translucent hand). Cost is tied to her final ghosting, which releases her anchor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" describes Lyra's method throughout. She materializes and vanishes in the opening, appears "more substantial" post-vision, and dissolves during the ritual guidance. The mechanic shapes Elara's sense of urgency and isolation. However, the method is more atmospheric than tactical; it does not create a visible constraint (e.g., limited time per appearance forcing hard choices). Present in setup, development, and closure; causal role in development (guiding Elara) but not irreplaceable—a stable ghost could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present from the opening and provides the site for all action. Its properties—endless night, luminous plants, glass panes—anchor every beat. The orchard's "final purpose" (weaving time) enables the climax, and the setting shift (dawn breaking, verdant fields) is the visible proof of closure. Constraints are mild (cold air, dormant dreamvine) but the setting supplies the resources (plants, bead among roots) that drive resolution. Irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact location. Early signal, beat involvement across all turns, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Winter-cracked fields" and "endless night" frame the timeframe atmospherically but do not impose a live clock. "Over the following days" is vague; no ticking deadline pressures Elara's choices. The winter setting persists until the climax reversal (dawn, verdant fields), providing a before/after image, but elapsed time does not tighten tactics. Present in setup and closure (reversed), absent in development as a constraint. Swappable with any seasonal or diurnal metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to repay a debt across lifetimes" is stated in the vision and drives Elara's subsequent actions. It is dramatized through her choices: holding the bead, chanting runes, accepting Lyra's release. However, internal friction is minimal—Elara understands and proceeds without competing wants. The motivation is present in setup (vision reveals it), development (working under Lyra's guidance), and closure (debt repaid, Lyra fades). Causal role is strong, but lack of embodied conflict between desire and cost keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named twice and modulates across beats: early silence "ached with memory," the vision brings "sorrowful joy," and the ending holds "mournful elation that bittersweetly honored their love." Tone coheres and supports the elegiac mood. However, it is more labeled than embodied; moments of sharp joy or raw grief are absent. The tone charges the final image (warm bead, verdant fields) but does not deepen under pressure—it remains static oxymoron. Present throughout, legible, but not irreplaceable or dynamically modulated.</comment>
