<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interiority remains abstract throughout—"profound emptiness," "unused courage"—without embodied contradiction or specific micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The silver-haired guide's gesture (pointing to Elara's heart) functions as tell-not-show wisdom delivery rather than dramatized insight earned through prior struggle. Internal conflict is summarized in alternating declarations (relief/emptiness) rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene, and the final realization arrives as philosophical epiphany without visible cost that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where the ridgeway exists physically, and what "the leash" tethered concretely remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"unused courage had been waiting...in the choices she hadn't dared to make"—but the cost is asserted rather than shown on the page; no prior live option is dramatized as foreclosed by this realization. The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric reprise, but causality between ferry journey and insight remains implicit, relying on metaphor rather than scene pressure to deliver the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, spectral bridge, and secluded shore offer vivid atmospheric detail, but spatial choreography is vague—how far, how long, what physical obstacles Elara navigates remain abstract. The star-punch and ferry constrain passage symbolically but do not alter tactical choices on the page; setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory selection leans heavily visual ("starlight reflecting," "mists parting") without embodied urgency or POV-filtered perception that reveals character priorities under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete reversal or narrowing choice that forces trade-off with visible cost. The ferry crossing and vigil unfold as atmospheric transit without escalation; the guides' "calm assurance" and Elara's passive observation do not generate friction or force her agency. The resolution is delivered by the guide's pointing gesture and Elara's internal epiphany, not by protagonist decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path, undercutting earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly—courage as internal choice rather than external destination—but arrives through direct statement in the penultimate paragraph ("the courage was not a physical place, but a realization within herself") rather than image or irony. The star stamp and shoreline lullaby recur but function as ornamental motifs without constraining choice or charging the final image with non-literal cost. The ending offers a quiet reconfiguration, yet the answer to the central question is articulated rather than embodied, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"air held the gentle persistence of a shoreline lullaby"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spectral bridge," "celestial imprint") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The guides speak minimally; their silence is purposeful, but Elara's internal voice lacks syntactic variety under pressure, relying on declarative summary ("She knew the journey would require...") that flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The leash had been her duty...a responsibility" and "The emptiness was a void that echoed" restate without advancing pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "They [verb]" and "The [noun] was [adjective]" stems (−0.5). Stock metaphors—"profound emptiness," "calm assurance," "newfound strength"—appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment (−0.3). Figurative density is high but mixed: "air held...a lullaby" personifies abstractly while "mists parting to reveal a clear way" literalizes the symbolic too tidily, reducing sharpness at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—internal courage discovered through symbolic journey—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative adjustment). The ferry guides, star punch, and vigil function as genre furniture (mythic quest markers) rather than irreplaceable particulars that emerge from this character's world. One fresh inflection: the leash as broken tether to family legacy offers specificity, but the resolution retreats to safe platitude ("courage...in the resolve to move forward") rather than bold, risky reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides appear in the second third, greet Elara, perform the star-punch ritual, pole the boat through indirect routes, and one points to Elara's heart near the end. They are present across multiple beats and shape the vigil, but their choices do not create key turns—Elara's realization is self-generated, and the guides function as passive facilitators. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development shows observation without decision that alters Elara's options. Swappability is high; generic mystical guides could replace them with minor edits. Apply late-appearance penalty (−0.3), ornamental facilitation (−0.6), and swappability (−0.5); credit beat involvement (+0.9) and closure presence (+0.7). Ceiling from missing causal pressure: mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch with star stamp is introduced in one beat (the guide clicks it onto Elara's slip), described as "cold to the touch" and "gleaming faintly," then mentioned at closure ("star-stamped ticket a reminder") and in the final line ("carried the star stamp in her memory"). Two appearances, but the second is summary recollection rather than dramatized reprise with reweighted meaning. The object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it marks passage symbolically but remains ornamental. Setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure mention (+0.4); subtract ornamental use (−0.7) and swappability (−0.5). Mid-band ceiling from lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A vigil in twilight is introduced early ("At dusk"), frames the spectral-bridge wait ("waiting for the right moment to cross"), and is reflected upon near closure ("The vigil had been a time of reflection"). The concept shapes the story's temporal structure and thematic pressure—waiting as necessary preparation—and the bridge's materialization "only at the exact intersection of day and night" makes the vigil a concrete constraint. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), causal pressure (waiting enables crossing, +0.8); subtract slight abstraction in payoff (the vigil becomes metaphor for internal reflection without visible cost, −0.4). Solid middle-high integration with thematic resonance but limited tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is introduced in paragraph 9 applied to "the air...like a shoreline lullaby," then attributed to the guides' movements ("gently persistent...never rushing but always advancing"), and finally internalized by Elara ("the gentle persistence now within her own steps"). The attribute appears across three beats, shaping tone and characterizing both environment and guides, then transferred to protagonist at closure. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure presence (+0.8), thematic carryover (+0.4); subtract label-only application in final beat (told rather than shown in Elara's steps, −0.5) and lack of visible tradeoff (persistence does not constrain a choice with cost, −0.4). Mid-band with lyric resonance but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Traverse" is the story's central action: Elara traverses the ridgeway, the guides traverse "the watery labyrinth," and "She had to traverse this enigmatic path" frames the inciting goal. The action structures all major beats—poling the boat, detours around eddies, crossing to the secluded shore—and the final paragraph confirms continuation ("stepped onto the path beyond"). Early signal (+0.7), three or more beats (+1.4), causal pressure (traversal enables progression and discovery, +1.2), closure linkage (+1.0); subtract slight swappability (could use "journey" or "cross" with minor edits, −0.4). Strong integration as the narrative spine, essential to structure and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is introduced early ("She knew the journey would require navigating through indirect routes"), demonstrated in the ferry crossing ("took detours around murmuring eddies and under arches"), and confirmed as method ("The method of travel was through indirect routes"). The indirection shapes tactics—avoiding "direct paths that were guarded or cursed"—and the piece's lyric structure mirrors the approach. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (method alters route choices, +0.9), thematic coherence (+0.5); subtract summary-only explanation in one paragraph (told mechanics rather than dramatized constraint, −0.4) and closure absence (method does not charge the final image, −0.3). Solid middle integration with tactical and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is introduced in the opening line, described as "enigmatic" and "known for its deceptive trails," and referenced at closure ("seemed less daunting now, its mists parting"). The setting frames the entire journey and the "veiled" quality creates atmospheric pressure, but it does not constrain a specific choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's path is determined by guides and vigil rather than terrain features. Early signal (+0.8), closure presence (+0.6), thematic resonance (veiled→clear mirrors internal shift, +0.5); subtract postcard-level description without tactical pressure (−0.6) and swappability (could use "shadowed path" or "hidden road," −0.5). Mid-band for thematic coherence without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" opens and closes the story, framing the timeframe as post-severance. The broken leash triggers Elara's journey and is reprised in the final paragraph ("after the leash breaks, she found where unused courage waits"). The element appears in two beats and provides motivational context, but time itself is not tracked or tightened—no clock pressures decisions, and "hours of journeying" is vague summary. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (+0.9), closure reprise (+0.6); subtract lack of tactical pressure (time does not narrow options, −0.8), summary-only mention of duration (−0.5), and swappability (could frame as "after the departure" with minor edits, −0.5). Low-mid integration; functions as metaphorical marker rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is introduced early as Elara's clear motivation, drives the journey to the secluded shore, and is resolved at closure ("the unused courage had been waiting...in the choices she hadn't dared to make"). The desire frames all major beats, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction—Elara never hesitates, doubts, or pays a cost to pursue this goal. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2); subtract told-only articulation without embodied conflict (−1.0), lack of competing desire or fear that creates tension (−0.8), and summary resolution (−0.5). Mid-low integration; motivation is present and resolved but not tested by choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" is introduced early ("air held the gentle persistence of a shoreline lullaby"), sustained through the guides' "rhythmic and steady" poling, internalized by Elara ("its rhythm remained in her heartbeat"), and closed with "faded into the distance" at the final shore. The tone is coherent across all turns, modulates subtly from external to internal, and charges the final image by becoming part of Elara's embodied state. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.3), rhythmic control that supports pressure (+0.6); subtract static gentleness that does not sharpen under peak stress (−0.5) and slight ornamental quality in mid-beats (−0.4). Solid high-middle integration with consistent tonal arc and lyric payoff.</comment>
