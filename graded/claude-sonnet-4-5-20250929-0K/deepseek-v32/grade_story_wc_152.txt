<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover the conspiracy is clear, but her agency operates almost entirely off-page through past stitching work. The final beat—delivering the tapestry—is dramatized but lacks visible internal conflict or a micro-choice under pressure; she simply completes and hands over a finished artifact. Interiority leans on summary ("her work complete," "knew her whispered tale was in the right hands") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The lack of on-page struggle or renunciation with felt cost during closure keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara stitches clues across the autumn weeks, synchronizing adjacent possibilities into a final chart. However, the decisive act—delivering the tapestry and the conspiracy being "met before it fully awoke"—occurs entirely off-page or in summary after her work is done. The closure image (candle flickering, wind moaning, "peace of a disaster averted") reconfigures meaning but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized with a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift is sufficient, but the final image lacks on-page proof of cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, autumn winds, arched windows, and the eternal candle establish vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The setting anchors Elara's isolation and frames the conspiracy's ticking clock. The candle itself enables the adjacent-possibilities method and charges the final image with its approving flicker. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail (dust motes, slanted light, cold air) tracks with urgency, though the observatory remains largely static across the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expose the conspiracy before the coup—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as autumn progresses and "the coup was now days away." However, escalation occurs primarily through summary and time markers rather than on-page reversals or tightening choices. Elara's final move (delivering the tapestry) is a completion without visible cost or trade-off; she maintains her guise and succeeds cleanly. The piece fits Accumulative design but lacks one on-page moment where a choice narrows options or a visible price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—hidden wisdom, preservation over power, unheard stories made legible—emerges organically from the embroidery cipher and adjacent-possibilities method. The final image (candle's approval, "echoed silence resonated with the peace of a disaster averted") offers a resonant answer to the central question. However, the ending leans on summary assertion ("her work was done, the unraveling complete") rather than a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior material without statement. The piece resists overt moralizing but the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative maintains stable third-limited focalization on Elara with consistent perceptual signature (her off-key humming, eyes missing nothing, focus on thread and flame). Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate, though some constructions ("her motivation was not to map known space, but to hear the whispers") read slightly expository. The prose modulates well under pressure, but rhythmic variety is limited by repeated syntactic stems (e.g., multiple "Elara [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" patterns). No dialogue is present to judge. POV remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately and information density is generally high, weaving setting, stakes, and method into most lines. However, the piece carries several paraphrase loops: "her work complete, the unraveling complete, the synchronization of truths achieved" restates closure three ways in quick succession; "echoed silence" appears four times across the text without evolving meaning. Template cadence in the final third ("The conspiracy would be met… its architects caught… the story had been told… the galaxy-chart embroiderer had mapped…") flattens propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure beat, applying −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer using embroidery as cipher, adjacent possibilities as investigative method, and the eternal candle as truth-revealer form a cohesive premise. However, the "lone eccentric artisan uncovers palace conspiracy through disguised craft" template is widely used, and the piece does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; Elara succeeds cleanly without visible cost or complication. The adjacent-possibilities method is explained but not dramatized in a way that forces hard choices. Derivative premise guardrail applies: −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara stitches, observes, and delivers the tapestry. Her choices (maintaining her guise, deciding to deliver the chart) are present but occur mostly in summary. The key turn—the conspiracy being exposed—happens off-page after her delivery. She is present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but her on-page decisions do not create the plot's key reversals; the work was done before the story's dramatized time. Mid-band: functional but replaceable with another patient investigator.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in setup (worktable description), development (Elara focuses on it to see adjacent possibilities), and closure (flickers "as if in approval"). It enables the method and charges the final image. However, its use in the middle is told rather than shown in a specific beat with cost, and the final flicker is a cameo rather than a causal action. Strong setup and closure participation, but mid-development work is summary-only, capping upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes the entire arc: Elara deciphers the Regent's advisors' plot, synchronizes fragmented clues, and charts the conspiracy's network in her embroidery. The concept is present in all three gates and drives the dominant stake. However, the actual unraveling occurs off-page through past stitching; the story dramatizes the delivery and aftermath, not the investigative process itself. The concept constrains tactics (maintaining her guise) and shapes the ending, earning mid-to-upper functional range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The attribute is seeded early ("disguised her wisdom as foolishness, humming off-key tunes") and returns at closure ("Disguising wisdom as foolishness had been her shield"). It enables her survival ("to warn anyone outright would mark her as a threat") and constrains her delivery method (gift dismissed as mere art). However, the trait is asserted more than dramatized; we do not see an on-page moment where the disguise costs her or forces a specific choice under pressure. Present across gates but primarily label-level.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears in setup (method introduction), development ("synchronizing the fragmented tales"), and closure ("the synchronization of truths achieved"). The action is central to the plot—without it, Elara cannot chart the conspiracy. However, synchronization is summarized rather than dramatized in beats; we are told she synchronizes but do not witness the specific act with cost or reversal. The word recurs but the action itself is not shown constraining choices on the page. Functional and essential, but execution is summary-driven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Adjacent possibilities are introduced early ("a method taught by her predecessor"), used in development ("focusing on the candle's flame, she could briefly see the world as it almost was"), and referenced at closure ("Through adjacent possibilities, she had found the story unheard"). The method enables the investigation and is specific to Elara's process. However, the mechanics are explained but not dramatized in a key beat; we do not see her make a choice between variant paths or pay a cost for accessing them. Present across all gates, but primarily expository.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory in autumn is anchored immediately and returns throughout: arched windows with autumn winds, the great telescope (silent but present), the cobalt dome at closure. The setting isolates Elara, frames her work, and the autumn timeframe tightens pressure as the coup nears. The observatory's "echoed silence" charges the final image. The setting does not directly alter a tactical choice on the page, but it constrains her solitary method and amplifies the stakes through atmosphere and seasonal urgency. Strong setup and closure presence with consistent development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is the explicit timeframe, signaled in the title-like final beats and tracked through autumn's progression ("autumn winds," "autumn air grew colder," "the coup was now days away," "On the eve of the coup"). The timeframe tightens decisions and creates urgency. However, the clock is measured in summary time markers rather than on-page moments where elapsed time alters tactics. The coup itself occurs off-page after the story ends. Present across all gates and provides structural pressure, but not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to listen for unheard stories" is stated early ("Her motivation was not to map known space, but to hear the whispers from between the stars") and echoed at closure ("the unheard story had been told"). The desire drives her method (adjacent possibilities to hear variants) and frames her goal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we do not see her face a trade-off between listening and another want. Present across gates but primarily asserted in exposition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" recurs four times across the text, frames the opening ("echoed silence of the hall felt heavy"), middle ("listening to the echoed silence"), and ending ("the echoed silence resonated with the peace of a disaster averted"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly as pressure accumulates (from "waiting to be filled" to "new quality of anticipation" to final "peace"). However, the phrase becomes repetitive without evolving meaning in most uses, trending toward ornamental recurrence. Present across gates and charges the final image, but overuse without variation limits upward movement.</comment>
