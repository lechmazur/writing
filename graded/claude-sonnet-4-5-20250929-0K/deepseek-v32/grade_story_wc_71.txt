<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to understand alive houses is clear and consistent, but his interior life reads as contemplative observation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The "inadvertently profound" discovery moment is told rather than earned through embodied stakes—he simply "understood" without visible cost or conflicted choice. The final turn toward tending his own house feels grafted on as resolution rather than emerging from prior struggle. No secondary character appears to test his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Leo collects objects, arranges them, witnesses the shard of hush, then applies the insight to his own space. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~80 words, acceptable. The closure unit—Leo's realization about his own house—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("felt sanctified, displaced no more") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible trade-off. The "shard of hush" manifestation introduces a late magical-realist rule without prior setup, creating a mild causality wobble. Accumulative density increases through object collection, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it summarizes theme instead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay, damp streets, orange streetlights, and clover patch are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt air, scent of orris root, violet and earth). The orris root shard as a micro-object constrains Leo's sanctification ritual and charges the climax. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the bay's tidal breathing is metaphorical rather than a constraint that alters Leo's choices. The house on Mariner's Lane is described as feeling alive but does not supply resources or obstacles that shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Leo faces no opposition, no narrowing of options, no visible price paid for his discovery. The arrangement of displaced objects and the shard's manifestation occur without resistance or trade-off. The final decision to tend his own house is contemplative rather than forced by pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the insight arrives as epiphany rather than through a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—homes are alive when they hold gathered silence as sacred—emerges organically from the displaced-objects motif and the shard of hush concept. The orris root's scent and the clover circle create concrete particulars. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "homes are alive when they hold silence not as emptiness, but as a gathered, sacred thing," stating the thesis rather than trusting the image to carry it. The epiphany about "inadvertent sanctity" is told in therapeutic abstraction ("a hushed blaze of clarity") rather than dramatized through Leo's micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, contemplative texture with purposeful compression ("streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Leo notices "slow changes others missed"—but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("inadvertently profound," "coalesced into peace") that reads authorial rather than character-bound. Free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythms modulate appropriately between observation and the climactic manifestation moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythms vary and sensory detail is vivid, but several lines loop conceptually: "quiet spirit" / "shard of hush" / "fragment of pure, palpable quiet" restate the same idea without added pressure. The phrase "hushed blaze" recurs four times as a tonal tag without evolving meaning. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He now knew why... Each home capable... He would tend to it..." stacks declarative stems. Minor filter-verb clusters ("he felt," "he understood," "he sensed") in the climax dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than story. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a character who sanctifies displaced objects to manifest a "shard of hush"—offers a fresh lyric-realist angle. However, the emotional arc (lonely observer finds purpose through noticing) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The orris root and displaced objects are particular, but the final insight ("homes are keepers of inadvertent sanctity") resolves into abstraction rather than a concrete, irreplaceable image. The story commits to its lyric premise but retreats into explanation at closure rather than trusting the manifestation moment to resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Leo the "creeping normality noticer" frames expectation early and his observation habit drives the collection of displaced objects. However, his choices—walking, collecting, arranging—are contemplative rather than under pressure. The discovery of the shard is passive (it "seemed to crystallize"); he does not decide to create it. The final choice to tend his own house is asserted in summary rather than enacted on the page. The character is present across all beats but observation without decision under stakes keeps the score mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in two beats: Leo finds it near the drainage ditch (~40% mark), pockets it, then places it at the center of his object circle where it triggers the shard of hush manifestation. Its scent (violets and earth) is specific and it serves as the ritual's focal point. However, it arrives late and does not constrain earlier tactics; it functions as a catalyst rather than shaping Leo's method across the arc. The object is integral to the climax but not indispensable to the broader story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is seeded early in Leo's observations of alive houses and manifests physically at the climax when his sanctification ritual crystallizes it. The concept shapes the dominant stake (understanding aliveness) and the final realization (his own house can hold such shards). It drives two beats: the manifestation and Leo's application of the insight to his home. The specificity of "shard" as a fragment of gathered quiet rather than mere silence is irreplaceable and charges the ending image, though the cost tied to it remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is introduced late (past the 50% mark) as a label for Leo's discovery moment: "This discovery was inadvertently profound, an attribute of the moment that shook him." It describes rather than constrains action. No on-page choice or cost traces to this trait; it functions as thematic gloss rather than a character engine. The attribute is ornamental—mentioned once without altering tactics or forecloses paths.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "sanctify" action is framed early ("He decided to attempt a sanctify action") and enacted at the climax when Leo arranges displaced objects in a circle and places the orris root at center. This ritual triggers the shard of hush manifestation, the story's key turn. However, the action is contemplative and unopposed; Leo faces no cost or resistance in performing it. The sanctification redefines his understanding but does not alter prior options or tactics under pressure. It is central to the arc but could be replaced with a similar ritual-framing action without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" as method is seeded early: Leo collects a stone, ribbon, button, and orris root across his evening walks. The method shapes his ritual (arranging the objects in a circle) and the climax (objects birth the shard of hush). It drives two beats: collection and sanctification. The mechanics matter—displaced items carry "resonance of moments" and can "coalesce into peace." The method is integral to Leo's approach and the story's logic, though the final insight that "alive houses" already hold such objects feels like a thematic echo rather than a constraint on Leo's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is established early with vivid sensory detail (salt air, blooming things, shedding gray winter skin) and frames Leo's walks. The bay's tidal rhythm metaphorically mirrors the house's aliveness. However, the setting does not constrain Leo's choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric container. The clover patch before the house and the drainage ditch where he finds the orris root are micro-settings that matter, but the bay itself remains postcard description. Present across beats but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" as timeframe is introduced early and recurs as tonal color (orange glow hesitating between dusk and night, streetlights flickering on, daydreaming light blending with stars). It sets mood but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Leo's evening walks and ritual occur within this dusk window, but no urgency or temporal constraint shapes his moves. The phrase is lyric and evocative but ornamental; time is vague and untracked, not a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation "to understand why some houses felt alive" is stated early and drives his evening walks, object collection, and sanctification ritual. It frames the dominant stake and is tested when he discovers the shard of hush and applies the insight to his own house. The motivation is present across all beats and shapes the arc's structure. However, it is never conflicted—Leo faces no friction between his want and cost, no competing desire or fear. The motivation is clear and consistent but dramatized through contemplation rather than choices under pressure with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" as tone appears four times: "hushed blaze of renewal," "hushed blaze tone," "hushed blaze of clarity," "hushed blaze" in the penultimate paragraph. The oxymoronic pairing (quiet intensity) coheres with the story's lyric-realist mode and modulates slightly from atmospheric observation to climactic insight. However, the tone remains static—contemplative and reverent throughout—without sharp modulation under pressure. It charges the final third but does not shift cadence at the closure beat; instead it is asserted as a label. The tone is consistent and purposeful but does not elevate the ending image beyond thematic echo.</comment>
