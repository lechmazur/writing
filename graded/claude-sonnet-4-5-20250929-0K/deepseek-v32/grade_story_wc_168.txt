<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is dominated by abstract label-speak ("bargained innocence," "hard softness," "translate pain into a universal language") rather than concrete perception under pressure. Emotional states are declared through summary ("surged, vivid and hot") instead of embodied contradiction. The character walks, pauses, sits, and stands without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; the final "smile" arrives as a neat resolution rather than earned endurance. No genuine internal conflict dramatizes the cost of moving forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early; no penalty applied. Closure issue: the ending claims Eli has "found his voice" and is "ready to translate," but no on-page decision, renunciation, or concrete action occurs—he simply arrives at a meeting place with a plan already formed off-page. The "bargained innocence" premise is narrated in backstory without present complication or cost. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the final image restates the opening thesis rather than reweighting it with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, weathered bench, and valley overlook are present and visually clear. However, setting details function as backdrop rather than constraint: the path does not narrow options, the box is not affected by the ridge environment, and the overlook merely stages the final declaration. The fire-blackened pine cone and cracked porcelain box are handled, but their physical properties (texture, fragility) do not alter Eli's tactics or the ending image in a way that would fail without this exact micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"translate pain into a universal language"—is declared early but never tested on the page. Eli faces no opposition, reversal, or cost in the present timeline; all conflict is backstory (the cabin fire, the child rescue). The walk to the overlook and decision to "share his reflections" involve no narrowing of options or sacrifice. The structure is a meditative drift rather than escalation under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated rather than emergent: "pain, when understood, can connect rather than isolate" and "bargained innocence" appear as direct assertions in narration. The pine cone and cracked box are introduced as symbolic shorthand ("a word in the dialect of survival") without accruing pressure across beats. The final paragraph moralizes the journey ("pain was no longer a solitary scream but a song") instead of offering a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Prompt labels dominate the thematic layer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited. However, the narrative voice converges with the prompt's abstract diction ("bargained innocence," "hard softness," "universal language") rather than filtering through Eli's firefighter-specific perception. Syntax is uniform across emotional beats: largely subject-verb declaratives with additive "and" connectors and identical paragraph rhythms. The final smile and readiness declaration flatten rather than modulate under the supposed climactic pressure. Filter verbs ("thought," "felt," "saw") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "reflecting deeply" appears verbatim multiple times; "bargained innocence" is restated across six paragraphs without added meaning; "gently skilled hands" and "hard softness" are recycled as labels. Template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun] was [state]" dominate the middle third. Stock metaphor strings: "pale ghosts," "slow dance of celestial bodies," "universal language," "dialect of survival." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("pain was no longer a solitary scream but a song"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap. Information density is low; many sentences restate the premise without advancing knowledge or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—scarred firefighter seeks to translate trauma into shared meaning via reflection on a ridge—maps closely to template redemption-arc structures without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The pine cone, cracked box, and "bargained innocence" function as prompt-response ornaments rather than irreplaceable particulars that alter the story's logic. The final image (smile, readiness, "found his voice") delivers median comfort rather than a risky or specific synthesis. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; each beat could be reordered or swapped with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The scarred firefighter is described and his backstory (cabin fire, child rescue) is narrated, but he makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or options. He walks, pauses, sits, opens the box, stands, and walks further—observation and transit without decision pressure. Setup present; development absent (no middle choice constrained by his scars or firefighter skills); closure participation absent (he arrives ready, no turn). Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; lower to 2.4 for ornamental use and summary-only involvement in key beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box appears in the opening (carried), midpoint (placed on bench, opened to reveal pine cone), and ending (cradled as a "prompt" for future meetings). Setup gate met; middle development weak (opening the box is descriptive, not a choice under pressure); closure participation present but static (mentioned as a prop for the未来 meeting, not causally active). The crack is traced as a "gesture born of habit" without altering present tactics. Two touches across beats, but swappable with any small keepsake; no unique property (porcelain fragility, the specific crack pattern) shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" is narrated as backstory theme ("promising himself to the fire's mercy") and restated in the final third ("bargained innocence was not a loss but a transformation"), but never dramatized as a live stake that constrains present options. Setup via summary; no middle choice where the concept pressures tactics; closure participation as thematic label only. Ornamental use throughout; easily removable with no structural break.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears twice as a descriptor of Eli's hands (opening, final third) but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. No scene shows the skill in use under pressure or a tradeoff between gentleness and force. Label-only mentions; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Enlighten" is stated as motive ("to enlighten himself," "aimed to enlighten others") and appears in the final-third summary ("he would enlighten by reflecting deeply"), but the action itself—what enlightenment looks like, what it costs, how it is tested—remains off-page. The future meeting is declared, not dramatized. Setup via abstract claim; no middle beat where enlightening another is attempted or refused; closure participation as future intent, not present turn. Swappable with "teach," "share," or "connect."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" is mentioned verbatim in three paragraphs as the method, but the mechanics are told rather than shown: Eli's reflection consists of walking, sitting, and opening a box while the narration supplies thematic summary. Setup present (first third); middle development weak (reflection does not alter a choice); closure participation present (final paragraph restates it). The method does not impose a visible cost or friction; easily replaceable with "remembering" or "contemplating."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path is anchored early, revisited at the bench and overlook, and frames the ending. Setup met; middle development weak (the path curves and Eli sits, but terrain does not pressure a choice); closure participation present (overlook as location for the未来 meeting). The ridge does not supply a resource, obstacle, or cost that would be missing in a generic hilltop. Swappable with "cliff trail" or "forest clearing."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears in the opening, mid-story ("stars continued their slow dance"), and ending ("slow dance of celestial bodies") as atmospheric description without tightening decisions or tracking elapsed time. No live clock; the celestial motion is ornamental metaphor. Setup via image; no middle development; closure participation as repeated phrase. Time does not alter tactics or impose urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"To translate pain into a universal language" is stated as Eli's motivation in the first third and restated in the final paragraph, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicting choices or on-page cost. No scene shows him attempting translation and failing, or choosing translation over another want. Setup via declaration; no middle friction where the motive pressures a decision; closure participation as thematic claim. Told-only; no visible cost tied to pursuing this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is introduced as character summary ("a man of hard softness, tempered by violence but capable of tender care") and restated in the final third ("hard softness of his character was a balance forged in flame"). Tone reads as single static mood—meditative, declarative—across all beats without modulation under pressure. Setup via label; no middle development where tone shifts with escalation; closure participation as repeated phrase. The tone does not charge the final image with felt cost; it remains an asserted quality rather than a lived effect.</comment>
