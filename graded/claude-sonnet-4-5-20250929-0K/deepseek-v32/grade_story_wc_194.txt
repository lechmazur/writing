<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation (uncover hidden truth) is clear, but his interior life reads as generic retrospection rather than embodied contradiction. The "realization" that Lord Thorne smiled in relief arrives via music-induced epiphany without prior on-page clues or internal resistance—it feels like a prompt fulfillment rather than an earned discovery. Emotional states are labeled ("peace," "regret") instead of shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance lacks visible cost; he simply "felt a peace" without forfeiting a live option or confronting a genuine flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (realization that he was instrument of liberation), but the closure lacks on-page cost: Alistair moves from guilt to peace without forfeiting anything or foreclosing a path with felt consequence. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when solidify only after ~150 words of abstraction ("sepia reading room," "dynasty ender" labels). The narrative is linear but the causal link from gramophone music to epiphany about Thorne's smile is asserted, not dramatized through prior contradictory evidence. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows a price paid at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room and golden shadows are vividly rendered and tonally consistent, but they function as mood rather than constraint. The gramophone and crank handle receive tactile detail (smooth worn wood, clicking mechanism), yet neither object shapes a choice or alters tactics—they serve as props for reflection. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, gramophone, room), but the setting never pressures Alistair's options. The final image charges atmosphere but does not constrain or enable the closure decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncover why Thorne smiled) is signaled early, but no on-page tightening or reversal narrows options. Alistair inserts the crank, listens, and receives the answer via vibes—no resistance, no competing interpretation, no trade-off. The "realization" is delivered rather than fought for, and there is no visible price or foreclosed path. The piece reads as a single reflective move without escalation under any lens; coincidence (music happens to convey the exact truth) resolves the question without protagonist cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (liberation vs. destruction, guilt vs. redemption) is coherent and emerges through imagery (golden shadows, sepia tones, standing waves), but the final paragraph over-articulates it: "some truths are not found in documents...but in the silent spaces between notes" is overt philosophizing. The ending offers a thematic answer but without the earned ambiguity or non-literal closure that would elevate resonance. The Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.4): the protagonist's realization reads like a thesis statement rather than a dramatized shift in stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and literary, with elevated diction ("eloquently silent," "bridge of intuition") that matches the reflective mode. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, the prose uniformly operates at high register without modulation under pressure, and several metaphors blur specificity: "standing waves" functions more as atmospheric gesture than concrete mechanism. Filter verbs ("felt a connection forming," "seemed to coalesce") stack in the climactic beat, dulling immediacy when POV-motivated directness would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but paraphrase loops proliferate: paragraphs 9–11 restate Alistair's musing without advancing pressure; "golden shadows" recurs decoratively across six paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the final third: "The sepia reading room...now felt like," "The story...was over, but," "some truths are not found...but in." Figurative density in high-pressure beats (standing waves, bridge of intuition, eloquently silent) is layered without clear payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Artifact spread touches the closure beat, adding −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (betrayer discovers victim's hidden relief) has potential, but execution leans on stock moves: the guilty man, the triggering object, the music-induced epiphany, the redemptive realization. "Standing waves" and "bridge of intuition" read as prompt fulfillment rather than organic world logic. The emotional arc (guilt → peace via epiphany) follows a well-worn template without fresh moral calculus or unexpected cost. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for lyric safety over dramatic specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Alistair (dynasty ender) is present throughout and his past betrayal anchors the premise, but his on-page choices are passive: he inserts a crank, listens, and accepts the delivered answer. The character attribute does not create key turns; it functions as backstory context. Late-breaking realization (final third) that he was "instrument of liberation" is told, not earned through a decision that alters present tactics. Swappable with "grieving betrayer" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle appears in setup (paragraph 6), is used in one beat (paragraph 11: insertion and turning), and returns in the final third as symbolic weight ("testament to a complex legacy"). Two-touch minimum is met, but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it serves as a ritual prop. The crank's function (wind the gramophone) is generic; its specificity (gift from Alistair) is mentioned but never tests a value hierarchy or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Bridge of intuition" is labeled twice (paragraphs 14, 29) as the metaphor for Alistair's realization process, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept is thematic decoration rather than a mechanism that alters options. Removing the phrase and substituting "insight" or "understanding" would require only minor edits; the intuition metaphor does not constrain how the discovery unfolds.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" appears three times (paragraphs 15, 28, 39) as a descriptor for communication via music and acceptance, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through a tradeoff: we do not see what Alistair foregoes by remaining silent or what silence costs him. Label-only mention without visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Muse" (verb: to ponder/reflect) structures the middle third (paragraphs 9–10: "Alistair began to muse," "mused his way to the truth"), but the action is interchangeable with "reflected," "pondered," or "meditated." It does not create a unique turn or redefine options; Alistair's passive reception of the music-delivered truth would proceed identically under a synonym. No felt cost or tactical shift tied to this specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Standing waves" (acoustic resonance) is named in paragraphs 13–14 and 20–21 as the method by which the gramophone music conveys memory. The concept is introduced late (second half) and functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than a mechanics that shapes attempts or choices. The "method" could be replaced with "the melody," "the sound," or "the music" with negligible structural impact. No causal pressure tied to wave physics; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is anchored early (title, paragraph 1) and recurs in the final third (paragraph 37: "once a prison of regret, now...sanctuary"). The setting provides stable atmosphere but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Alistair's discovery would proceed identically in any quiet space with a gramophone. The room's "sepia" quality and lamplight charge tone but do not constrain tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" is named in the opening and closing (paragraphs 1, 38: "evening yawned wider"), framing the story within a single dusk window. Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the reflection unfolds at leisure without a live clock. The timeframe is decorative—removing it or substituting "afternoon" would not alter the narrative arc. No tactical pressure from elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" (why Thorne smiled) is stated in paragraph 4 and drives Alistair's reflection throughout. It shapes the dominant stake and is resolved on the page (paragraphs 24–26: realization of Thorne's relief). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices, and the discovery arrives without visible cost or friction. The motivation is essential but executed passively; no trade-off between uncovering truth and another want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recur across six paragraphs (2, 14, 17, 34, 36, 44) as the dominant tonal signature, blending visual motif with mood (regret, memory, peace). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from melancholy to acceptance. The final image ("carrying the golden shadows within him") reprises the motif with reweighted meaning, but the shift feels asserted rather than charged by prior cost. Tone supports closure without transforming it; solid integration, mid-band.</comment>
