<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Anya's motivation to teach through withholding is clearly signaled, but her interiority remains sparse—we see her method more than her contradictory impulses. Leo's frustration-to-absorption arc is traced through observation rather than embodied micro-choices; his final diffusion reads more as a state change than a decision with visible cost. The backwards-aging detail is mentioned but never constrains a choice or alters her perception under pressure. Embodied emotion is limited; the piece favors atmospheric description over contradictory feelings acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the trance deepens through repeated stone-drop observations until Leo's final diffusion reconfigures his relationship to visibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he stops effortful cloaking and aligns with the grotto's frequency, forgoing his prior approach with felt cost. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "when" in clock time remains vague. The piece coheres under its lens and the final integration carries thematic weight, but causality is attenuated—Leo's shift is observational accretion rather than a motivated choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto and dark pond constrain the teaching method and charge the final image—Leo's reflection fades in the water as he achieves transparency. The floating platform and crystalline rock pulse with sensory detail filtered through the trance's "lattice of shimmering potential." Spatial choreography is clear: platform above, grotto below, pond at center. The "sycamore hush" and "speckled starlight from fissures" are vivid and purposeful. The grotto's magnetism functions as both setting and conceptual anchor, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Leo learning to vanish, signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through his repeated failure and Anya's deliberate withholding, then deepens when he shifts from effort to receptive alignment. The cost is legible—he must abandon conscious control, a renunciation of his prior method—but it arrives through observation rather than a decision that narrows live options. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient; the final alignment reweights his approach with felt cost, though the protagonist's agency remains passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the grotto's mechanics: visibility requires interruption, invisibility requires alignment with a forgotten frequency. The stone-drop patterns and "space between the rings" function as non-literal teaching without overt moralizing. The final image—Leo's reflection fading—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stated moral. Anya's "weaves truth carefully" operates thematically, though it risks abstraction; the delayed-revelation concept is well-integrated. Minor slip: "You become the quiet wood itself" inches toward direct thematic statement, but the surrounding particulars anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Anya initially, then shifts cleanly to shared trance focalization without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"sycamore hush," "lattice of shimmering potential," "harmonic state"—matching the meditative frame. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, carrying subtext in Anya's deliberate obscurity. Minor register issue: "wavelength it has forgotten how to sense" reads slightly expository in a peak teaching beat. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any contemplative instructor. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—long, immersive sentences during trance observation, shorter fragments at Leo's realization. Information density is high in the grotto description; each image advances the teaching metaphor. Minor loops: "not in the mind, but in the resonance" / "not a force, but an invitation" repeats the negation-then-correction structure without pattern-teaching. "Sycamore hush" bookends the piece but adds no reweighted meaning at closure. Figurative language is dense—"magnetic grotto," "lattice of shimmering potential," "receptive patience"—occasionally clustering without clear payoff. No major artifacts touch closure; propulsion is steady if contemplative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The backwards-aging researcher and "vanishing to appear" paradox offer fresh angles, but neither is fully exploited—Anya's reverse aging affects neither her choices nor her perception. The stone-drop teaching method is specific and well-realized, avoiding generic meditation tropes. The grotto's magnetic silence as alignment rather than hiding is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to its contemplative register without retreat but remains within established mystical-training conventions. Transformation test: the core emotional arc—frustration to receptive observation—could transfer to other teaching frames with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Anya is present throughout and her choice to withhold instruction frames the conflict, but her backwards aging is ornamental—it does not constrain her teaching method or alter her perception. Her decision to guide Leo downward into the grotto is functional but replaceable; another instructor could make the same move. She shapes setup and middle development but does not make a closure choice that turns the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is signaled early, used across multiple beats (arrival, stone-drop observations, final alignment), and charges the closure—Leo's reflection vanishes in its pond. Its magnetic silence functions causally as the teaching mechanism: alignment rather than effort. The grotto's crystalline rock and dark water constrain the method and make the final transparency legible. Irreplaceable; no generic meditation space would carry the same conceptual freight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Delayed revelation shapes the entire teaching arc—Anya withholds explicit instruction, letting Leo discover alignment through repeated observation. It constrains her method in setup and middle beats, and the final moment is explicitly the revelation arriving: "The delayed revelation struck Leo not as an idea, but as a resonance." It drives tactics (stone drops without explanation) and alters Leo's options at closure. Strong causal role across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is demonstrated through Anya's method—she speaks in deliberate obscurity, drops stones without explanation, and lets patterns emerge. It constrains her teaching choices in multiple beats and ties to the delayed-revelation concept. However, the trait itself is never tested or traded off; she never faces pressure to abandon careful weaving for direct instruction. Present across beats but no visible cost attached to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Withholding is the engine of the teaching method, present in setup ("she would have to withhold the very truth he sought"), executed across the stone-drop beats ("She withheld further instruction"), and tied to closure via delayed revelation. It shapes Leo's frustration-to-observation arc and makes the final alignment necessary. The action is specific and irreplaceable—direct instruction would short-circuit the discovery. Strong causal role with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stone-drop method is signaled early, used across multiple middle beats ("stone after stone" for "what felt like hours"), and directly enables the closure—Leo sees "the space between the rings" and learns to align rather than shout. The mechanics matter: the ripple geometry teaches cause-and-effect alignment. Irreplaceable; the method's specificity drives both the teaching and Leo's final diffusion. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating platform is anchored early and frames the trance space, but does not constrain choices—the teaching occurs in the grotto beneath. It provides atmospheric grounding and a spatial anchor (above/below structure), returning in the final line's "sycamore hush" bookend. Functional setup and lyric reprise, but no middle pressure or tactics shaped by the platform itself. The grotto does the causal work; the platform is a threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The trance is signaled as "the timeframe through which all true learning would occur" and stretches subjective time—"what felt like hours within the trance's stretched moment." It enables prolonged observation that wouldn't fit ordinary time, shaping the teaching method. However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the piece uses it for expansion rather than pressure. Present in setup, middle (stone repetitions), and closure context, but no live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Anya's motivation to teach vanishing-to-appear is declared early, drives her withholding method across beats, and frames the closure—Leo finally learns to vanish by aligning rather than cloaking. The motivation is tested through Leo's frustration and her patient repetition. Minor friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized; we don't see Anya struggle with the choice to withhold or face cost for her method. Strong setup and payoff, less friction in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" opens and closes the piece, establishing stillness as both setting and thematic target. Tone remains coherent through the trance—calm, meditative, with elevated diction—and modulates slightly when Leo's frustration cuts the quiet, then returns to receptive silence at closure. The hush charges the final image: Leo welcomed home into the quiet he has learned to embody. Strong setup and payoff with consistent atmospheric control; the tone constrains the teaching method (no shouting, no effort) and aligns with the vanishing-to-appear paradox.</comment>
