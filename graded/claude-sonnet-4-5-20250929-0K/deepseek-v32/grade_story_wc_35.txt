<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's ability to taste memories is established early and her final choice to subsume the fortress's remorse shows embodied cost. However, her interiority relies heavily on stock metaphors ("raw landscape of borrowed sorrows," "quieter regrets") and the emotional progression from sensing to subsuming lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves in a straight line toward sacrifice without genuine internal conflict. The supporting cast (Elara, unnamed others) apply pressure but remain functional placeholders without distinct agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and moves through a clear causal chain: rain reveals pavilion → Mira analyzes structure → she absorbs remorse → fortress is freed. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the pavilion dissolves, the contagious weight lifts, Mira carries the cost forward), and the cost is legible in "her own palate was forever altered, heavy with the remorse she had chosen to carry." However, the timeframe "at the close of an unspoken dream" remains vague metaphor rather than a concrete constraint that shapes tactics, and the tidal-pool analysis method appears as a single explanatory sentence without altering her approach on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp sandstone, steaming walls, frozen coral weeping into mist), and the revealed pavilion directly enables the climactic act. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the courtyard-to-eastern-dune transition compresses without tracking movement. The pavilion's transformation (frozen → weeping → dissolving → ghost skeleton) reflects and charges the emotional arc, meeting micro-setting sufficiency for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the fortress from stored remorse—is signaled early and tested in Mira's central act of subsuming the emotion. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places hands on the coral and the remorse hits "not as a taste, but as a full-bodied consumption," raising the cost. However, no live option is foreclosed; Mira never hesitates or weighs a competing path, so the escalation reads more as intensity increase than a decision under pressure. The resolution is protagonist-driven with visible cost (her palate forever altered), meeting baseline sufficiency but lacking a trade-off that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—collective guilt, the cost of absorbing others' pain, memory as poison and release—emerges organically from the coral structure and Mira's sacrifice without overt statement. The final image of the fortress "no longer a prison of its past" and Mira walking away with "borrowed sorrows" offers resonance. The piece resists moralizing, yet the emotional logic is tidy: Mira's act cleanly trades her peace for the fortress's freedom with little ambiguity or counter-reading. The "sturdy brittle" motif recurs but functions more as atmospheric texture than a reweighting element at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (chef's palate, tidal-pool youth) is present but underused—the tidal method is told in one line rather than filtering her active perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("latent spice," "subsume," "transparent as glass") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially under peak stress. Elara's brief dialogue ("It is the stored remorse…") reads functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Recurring phrase structures create template cadence: "The sandstone walls… seemed both enduring and fragile," "a collective guilt… we no longer name," "sturdy brittle" x3, "the fortress… stood silent and resilient." Synonym loops appear in adjacent lines: "sandpaper rough memories" / "smooth the jagged edges," "felt both lighter and profoundly weary." Mixed metaphors muddle logic: coral is "icebound" yet "saline," and a "perpetual chill" that later "weeps" and becomes "warm mist" without causal bridge. The final paragraph stacks scaffolding beats (she turned, feet crunched, sky was vast, bird called, it was enough) that paraphrase completion rather than advancing pressure. These patterns lower density and dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The chef-as-empath premise and coral pavilion as vessel for emotion offer a fresh synthesis, and the tidal-pool analysis nods toward grounded method. However, the core emotional arc—hero absorbs collective pain to free a community—is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through surprising moral calculus or lived occupational detail (the chef's craft beyond "taste memories" and "incorporation" remains abstract). The pavilion's dissolution and Mira's walk into the desert are evocative but not structurally indispensable to the sacrifice arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's ability to taste memories is introduced in the opening and enables the climactic subsumption, but her choices are linear—she arrives to help, senses the problem, and absorbs it without competing motives or a decision that alters tactics. The trait shapes one major beat (the coral touch) and participates in closure, meeting two gates, but her chef identity does not constrain or complicate her approach; any empath could perform the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coral pavilion is discovered early (first third), analyzed at midpoint (tidal-pool formation mapping), and dissolves in the climax, meeting all three gates. Its unique properties—frozen, saline, spiraling in concentric rings—matter on the page: Mira must touch it, and its structure guides her understanding. The pavilion's transformation (frozen → weeping → mist → ghost skeleton) charges the ending image. It drives two distinct beats and is causally irreplaceable, but the analysis beat is summary rather than dramatized interaction, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stored remorse is signaled immediately ("the fortress keeper… cold, sickening remorse"), shapes the central conflict (Mira must absorb it), and anchors the closure (the contagious weight is lifted). It appears across three beats (handshake, pavilion discovery, subsumption) and its mechanics—emotional contagion through touch—constrain tactics (Elara and others cannot approach without contamination). The concept is irreplaceable and carries visible cost at closure (Mira's palate "forever altered"), meeting all gates with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional contagion through touch is introduced early (Elara's handshake floods Mira with remorse) and returns at the climax (Mira's hands on the coral column trigger full-bodied consumption). The trait constrains two beats: the handshake forces immediate shared shame, and at closure, "she did not reach out to touch" signals the lifted contagion. Visible tradeoff appears when Mira absorbs the remorse with cost. However, the middle development is minimal—touch does not alter Mira's tactics between discovery and climax—capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subsume is the climactic action: "Her task was not to merely taste, but to subsume. She opened herself, drawing the crystalline remorse into the core of her being." It drives the resolution (pavilion dissolves, fortress freed, Mira carries the cost) and is causally irreplaceable—removing it collapses the ending. The action appears in setup (Mira's motivation frames it), development (she must understand the structure first), and payoff (the on-page act with visible cost). Swapping "subsume" for "absorb" or "consume" would preserve logic but lose thematic precision, holding the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations is mentioned once in summary: "She studied the way the frozen coral branches spiraled and pooled, mapping how emotion might crystallize in similar concentric rings." The method does not appear in setup or shape middle tactics—it is introduced and resolved in a single explanatory beat without dramatized mechanics. The pavilion's spiral structure does enable Mira's understanding, but the tidal-pool lens itself is swappable (geological layers, tree rings) without altering outcome. Late, ornamental, and summarized use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain anchors the opening and returns in the final image ("stood silent and resilient behind her"). The rain's reveal—collapsed dune exposing the pavilion—directly enables the plot. Environmental details (damp sandstone, steaming walls, wet sand) are filtered through Mira's perception and recur across beats. The setting constrains access (the pavilion was hidden until rain) and charges the ending (fortress lighter, air tasting of potential), meeting all three gates. However, after the initial reveal, the fortress's specific features (courtyard, walls) function as backdrop rather than actively shaping Mira's tactics at the coral, capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the close of an unspoken dream, that hazy moment before full consciousness" is introduced at the two-thirds mark as metaphoric atmosphere rather than a constraint. It does not shape Mira's tactics or impose urgency; the actual time pressure is "as dawn approached" and "the first true light of day," which function as passive scene transitions. The "unspoken dream" returns in closure ("the final vestiges of the dream dissolving") as thematic echo but does not reweight prior material with cost. Late, vague, and ornamental use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to sandpaper rough memories, to smooth the jagged edges of the past" is stated in the opening and drives her journey to the fortress. The phrasing recurs at closure ("rough memories were not gone, but their edges were blunted, sandpapered into bearable, smooth stones"), charging the final image. However, the motivation is never dramatized in conflict—Mira does not weigh competing desires or face friction between her want and cost until the climax, and even then she moves in a straight line toward sacrifice. Told-framed with purposeful reprise but minimal on-page friction caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle appears three times: opening ("damp, sturdy brittle silence"), peak beat ("sturdy brittle dawn"), and near-closure ("a sound both sturdy and brittle"). The pairing coheres with the desert-after-rain setting and Mira's sacrifice (endurance + fragility), and it modulates from environmental descriptor to characterizing the resolution's "fragile peace, hard-won and transparent as glass." The tone charges the final image but does not constrain choice or shift under pressure—it remains a static atmospheric overlay. Functional reprise with thematic fit but limited causal work holds the score at upper-5s.</comment>
