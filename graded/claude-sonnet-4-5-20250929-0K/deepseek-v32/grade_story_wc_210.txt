<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clearly rooted in his rejection of false comfort, and his deliberate process of absorbing working memory to reimagine the cove shapes his choices throughout. The trader's arrival and decision to stay feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through Kai's agency—the "palpable integrity of the work" is asserted more than dramatized. Internal contradiction is present in Kai's exile versus his principled stance, but emotional embodiment remains mostly cerebral; the callus on a woman's hand and tide calculations are sensory fragments from the bottle, not Kai's own lived struggle. The final choice to display the bottle and rebuild lacks visible cost on the page; we see preparation but not a moment where Kai forecloses a competing path or pays a price that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Kai layers memory fragments, maps old logic, plants crops, and eventually attracts settlers through accreted small actions. Orientation anchors (Kai, deserted alchemist, on the pier, after the last wish) arrive early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cove reviving as "a conscious, conceived successor"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—we're told the work is "arduous" and that false comfort is rejected, yet no specific forfeiture or trade-off crystallizes in the final image. The bottle's display in the meeting hall and the trader's question feel more like symbolic gestures than a decisive reweighting of prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber bottle (warm, swirling light, no opening) and the abandoned lighthouse ground Kai's process in specific, recurring details. The forgotten clay pit, blackberry location, and irrigation channels are discovered through memory-guided action, and the paper lantern on the pier serves as a concrete signal that draws the trader. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, lighthouse, cove, forge, meeting hall), and the setting evolves causally as Kai clears channels and plants crops. The bottle constrains Kai's method—he must hold it, empty his working memory, and resonate with fragments—charging both the process and the final display, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining a civilization from foundational impulses—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is more textural than pressure-driven. Kai's days of walking, mapping, and planting show accumulation of effort, yet no moment where that effort is tested or threatened; the trader's arrival feels like confirmation rather than complication. The rejection of the magical spring's false comfort sets up a philosophical contrast, but Kai never faces a live temptation or trade-off that would dramatize the cost of his method. The ending image (new community arising) is a resolution without visible friction or forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—genuine growth through arduous memory and rejection of easy comfort—emerges organically from Kai's process and the contrast with the drained spring. The bottle as a "testament to process, not a relic of power" and the cove as "a conscious, conceived successor" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without didacticism. The final image reweights the opening (hollow buildings and false peace) with the new community's integrity, and the accumulation of small, hard-won details (callus, tide angles, shared heat logic) grounds the theme in particulars. However, the phrase "not as a copy, but as a conscious, conceived successor" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication, and the trader's question—"if he could stay a few days, to help clear the old forge"—articulates cooperation a bit cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third limited to Kai; distance modulates purposefully (tight on sensory fragments from the bottle, wider on the days of walking). The prose carries a distinct, controlled texture: "the mind's scratchpad for immediate tasks," "not a resurrection, but a reconciliation," "accumulation of a thousand minor, truthful ones." Kai's perceptual signature is consistent—he notices practical fragments, social logic, and truthful details—and the narrative voice matches his deliberate, principle-driven stance. The trader's brief dialogue ("weary of easy ports," asking to stay) is functional and naturalistic, though we hear only one exchange. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final paragraph's diction ("palpable integrity," "conscious, conceived successor") remains within Kai's philosophical register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative lists, embedded clauses), and information density is high: nearly every line advances Kai's process or the cove's transformation. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly ("a cruel joke now," "hollow buildings and false peace"), and the final image ("born from the rejection of a comforting lie and the arduous, truthful work of memory") recharges the premise. However, several phrases show mild scaffold or elevated register: "This was conception through working memory: not a single brilliant idea, but the accumulation of a thousand minor, truthful ones" reads slightly expository; "palpable integrity of the work" asserts rather than shows; "conscious, conceived successor" feels abstract. A paraphrase loop appears in the penultimate paragraph: "They built, argued, and cooperated, their own memories layering upon the old" restates what the prior sentences demonstrated. These minor artifacts prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core concept—ghost town revival through working memory rather than magic—offers a fresh angle, and the specific mechanics (holding the bottle, resonating with fragments, cross-referencing sensations) transform a familiar alchemist-exile trope. The amber bottle with no opening, the paper-lantern signal, and the trader drawn by integrity rather than promises are all purposeful, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (exile → solitary work → gradual community return) follows a recognizable template, and the trader's arrival lacks friction or surprise; he simply "came ashore" and "asked if he could stay," which feels convenient. The piece commits fully to its premise and resists abstraction in most beats, but the final turn (new community arising) is more confirmation than transformation, capping originality in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai (deserted alchemist) is present from the opening and drives all key turns: he holds the bottle to access memory, walks the cove cross-referencing sensations, clears channels, plants crops, makes the paper lantern, tells the trader the cove's true story, and answers settlers' questions with deduced principles. His choices—rejecting false comfort, using working memory, preparing fertile ground—create the conditions for the trader's arrival and the community's formation. The element appears in setup, middle development (mapping, planting), and closure (answering questions, displaying the bottle), with causal pressure throughout. Specificity is high (alchemist exiled for rejecting easy magic), and cost is visible in the "arduous" process and exile. Missing a higher score because the final choice (displaying the bottle) feels more symbolic than a decisive turn with felt trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in the opening ("warm to the touch and swirling with faint, captured light"), is held and used in the lighthouse to access memory fragments, carried during days of walking to guide discoveries (clay pit, blackberries, irrigation), and displayed in the new meeting hall as "a testament to process." It shapes Kai's method (must hold it and resonate with working memory) and charges the closure image (from reason for exile to communal symbol). The bottle's properties (no opening, warm, swirling light, unedited working memory) are irreplaceable and specific. Appears in setup, middle beats, and closure; causal pressure is clear. Cost connection is present (exile for holding it, arduous method). Slightly below 8.5 because the final display is symbolic rather than an active choice with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's engine: Kai's entire arc is reimagining the cove from its foundational memories, and every action (mapping channels, planting crops, making the lantern, attracting settlers) serves that stake. The concept shapes tactics (no magic, only preparation and principles) and the ending (cove reviving as "a conscious, conceived successor"). It appears in setup (the last resident left, hollow buildings), development (Kai's mapping and planting), and closure (new community asking questions and building). Causal pressure is high—the concept constrains Kai's method and enables the community's return. Cost is visible in the arduous work and rejection of easy solutions. The concept is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kai's rejection of false comfort is established early (exiled "for rejecting such easy, empty magic," "false comfort on principle"), constrains his method (no magical spring, only memory and hard work), and enables the ending (settlers drawn by "palpable integrity" rather than promises). The trait shapes at least two beats: the opening contrast with the drained spring, and the meal with the trader where Kai "offered no magic, only a meal of freshly caught fish and the story of the cove's true foundation." Cost is visible in Kai's exile and the "arduous" process. The trait is specific and irreplaceable. Slightly below 8.0 because the cost is more backstory and thematic statement than a live on-page trade-off where Kai must choose discomfort over an easier path in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Conceive" appears explicitly in "This was how Kai would conceive his plan" and "To reimagine a civilization, he had to hold both the past's raw memories and the present's stark reality in his mind at once, comparing, contrasting, conceiving connections." The action shapes Kai's method (conception through working memory fragments rather than single brilliant idea) and the closure (cove as "a conscious, conceived successor"). It is signaled early and present in middle beats (mapping, deducing principles). However, the mechanics overlap heavily with "working memory" (9 F), and "conceive" could be replaced with "design" or "reimagine" without structural loss. Causal pressure is moderate; cost connection is conceptual rather than felt. Present in setup and closure, but swappability and overlap lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Working memory is introduced early ("the mind's scratchpad for immediate tasks") and its mechanics are detailed: Kai empties his mind to the immediate present, his working memory becomes "a clear pool," and he feels "fleeting, practical fragments" (callus, tide angles, argument). The method constrains his approach (must hold the bottle, resonate, cross-reference sensations) and shapes multiple beats: the lighthouse session, days of walking, mapping channels, planting crops, and answering settlers' questions with deduced principles. It appears in setup, development, and closure, with high causal pressure and specificity. Cost is visible in the "arduous, constant mental presence" required. Slightly below 8.5 because the method's final payoff (displaying the bottle, answering questions) is more summary than a dramatized moment where working memory enables a decisive choice with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named in the opening ("a cruel joke now"), and specific locations (pier, lighthouse, clay pit, irrigation channels, forge, meeting hall) anchor Kai's actions and guide discoveries. The setting provides resources (clay, blackberries, channels, old memory-seeds) that affect outcome, and the paper lantern on the pier functions as a signal that draws the trader. The cove's emptiness (last resident left, hollow buildings) sets the stakes, and its gradual transformation (cleared channels, planted crops, new meeting hall) tracks the arc. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure. However, the cove is more backdrop than active constraint—most choices (holding the bottle, mapping, planting) would work in any ghost town. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting doesn't force a choice or alter tactics the way a hostile environment or scarce resource would.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" anchors the opening (last resident left a month ago, spring drained) and sets the condition for Kai's work: no more magic, only memory and effort. The timeframe appears in setup and implicitly shapes the middle (Kai works "for days") and closure (settlements form over unspecified time). However, the timeframe is loose—"a month ago," "for days," "one evening"—and doesn't tighten decisions or create a live clock. Kai's process unfolds without temporal pressure; the trader's arrival is coincidental rather than timed. Cost connection is conceptual (the spring's depletion forces a new approach) but not felt as urgency. Present in two gates (setup, middle implication) but missing closure participation; no countdown or deadline that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kai's motivation—to reimagine an entire civilization—is introduced early ("He did not seek to rebuild, but to reimagine an entire civilization from its foundational impulses") and dramatized through his actions: holding the bottle, walking the cove, cross-referencing sensations, mapping social logic, planting crops, making the lantern, telling the trader the story, and answering settlers' questions. The motivation shapes stakes, tactics, and the ending (cove as "a conscious, conceived successor"). Friction is present in the arduous method versus the easy comfort of the spring, and cost is visible in Kai's exile and the constant mental presence required. The motivation appears in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure. Slightly below 8.5 because the friction is more thematic contrast than on-page conflict where Kai must choose between competing desires with immediate consequence.</comment>
