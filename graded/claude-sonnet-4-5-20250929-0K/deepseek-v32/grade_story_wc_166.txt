<comment>Elara's motivation to inscribe cosmic verse is stated clearly but her interior remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The "obsidian grace" descriptor and "swept arm" movements function as poetic placeholders rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation ("trembling and radiant," "finally full") reads as declared satisfaction rather than earned cost; no visible path is foreclosed with felt consequence. Backstory (tide dancer past, Nostalgia Ban context) exceeds brief fragments and never tilts a present choice on the page.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers dance, speck-anchor, and gap-observation toward a lyric closure. Orientation arrives by ~180 words (dome, garden, cliffs), within tolerance. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: exile → coronation stance), but cost is asserted ("trembling," "finally full") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price paid. The speck's anchor and fall bracket the arc, yet no because/therefore linkage tightens tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<comment>The twilight garden, dome of woven stone, and night-blooming jasmine anchor space vividly. The moonstone speck on the collarbone functions as micro-setting: it fixes a point and defines center, constraining her movements ("every movement now related to that fixed, celestial point"). This supplies the one purposeful constraint that charges the final image when the speck falls and vanishes, satisfying the 9+ gate structure. Sensory detail (cool marble, jasmine scent, "phantom pressure of constellations") enriches without excess.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—pen a cosmic verse—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The speck's spontaneous anchor is coincidence that enables rather than earned reversal; no choice narrows options or incurs visible trade-off. The year of observation occurs off-page; on-page beats (speck falls, she dances, verse "settles") proceed without friction or cost clarity. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here density alone substitutes for escalation.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—exile as arrival, solitude as canvas—emerges organically from particulars (banned sea-chants, gap-observation method, body as parchment). The ending image (speck falls, invisible mark remains, "coronation") reweights exile without overt statement. However, lines like "a song the sea could never sing, a memory no ban could erase" and "a testament of obsidian grace, forever anchored within" edge toward thematic echo, declaring meaning the scene has already shown. No moral is stated, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the resonance.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("murmuring coastal city," "language of obsidian grace," "scripture only her soul could read"), but register drifts into ornamental abstraction during peak beats ("phantom pressure of constellations being drawn"). Perceptual signature is present (gap-observation bias, dancer's kinesthetic focus) but compressed under metaphorical density. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds. Elision of the year-long observation is purposeful compression that supports lyric mode, though it removes on-page struggle.</comment>

<comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences across all beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5): "twilight garden," "obsidian grace," "drafting limbs," "living pen," "phantom pressure," "scripture only her soul could read." Adjacent lines loop conceptually: "It was a poem of silence and distance" immediately followed by elaboration that restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "She had woven... She smiled... finally full." Mixed metaphors: "pen inscribing a destiny" while dancing, "verse settle into her... a permanent tattoo of meaning made from void and desire." Cumulative artifact penalty −1.0; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Core premise—mapping stellar gaps onto skin via dance after a nostalgia ban—offers a fresh synthesis. The gap-observation method and spontaneous moonstone anchor provide specific, non-generic detail. However, the Nostalgia Ban world-rule and tide-dancer past function as backdrop without affecting on-page choices; swapping "nostalgia" for another abstraction would leave the arc intact (transformation test concern). The ending's coronation metaphor and "obsidian grace" refrain lean toward elevated abstraction rather than grounded lived detail. One fresh inflection (speck as fixed north) elevates above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Tide dancer skill is present (setup: "skilled tide dancer," "read the push and pull") and her final dance inscribes the verse (payoff), but no mid-scene choice is constrained by dance expertise. Her movements are described lyrically ("sweeping arm," "arch of her back") without on-page decision points where tide-dancer training alters tactics or reveals cost. The skill feels ornamental rather than causally essential. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with no development caps eligibility ~6.0; swappability and ornamental use lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Moonstone speck appears early (first third: "fell from a crumbling heirloom necklace"), anchors spontaneously on her collarbone (middle beat: "the speck did not stir... true north, the first syllable"), and falls at closure ("finally loosened its hold and fell... vanished into the dark soil"). Three gates met; the speck constrains her center and charges the final image when it releases. Causal pressure is moderate (it defines but does not test her), and the "purpose served" phrasing borders on summary. Strong integration across beats with closure linkage pushes into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Elective exile frames the opening ("Elara chose an elective exile") and the ending reconfigures it ("Her exile was no longer a retreat, but a coronation"), meeting setup and payoff. However, exile does not constrain or enable a mid-scene choice; it remains thematic backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The Ban and coastal departure occur off-page. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure, lifting score above ornamental, but lack of middle development and swappability (could be "self-imposed solitude" with minor edits) cap near mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears in the inciting beat ("the speck did not stir. It was spontaneously anchored") and defines her method ("The anchored speck defined her center"). It constrains on-page action: every movement relates to the fixed point, altering her dance from chaotic to charted. The attribute enables the verse inscription with visible consequence (her movements become drafting). Three gates met (setup, development, payoff) with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity and cost connection present but not deeply tested; strong mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Fledge" is defined explicitly in the fourth paragraph ("To fledge, for a tide dancer, meant to leave the water's constant embrace and find a new medium") and the narration states "Elara was fledging now." The concept brackets the arc (leaving sea-dance, inscribing star-verse) but does not create a distinct on-page turn; it describes the transition rather than driving a choice. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle development weak. The major turn (speck anchors, verse completes) would occur without the "fledge" label. Lyric coherence lifts it near 6.0, but swappability and summary-only use prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Observing gaps" is seeded early ("She did not watch the stars themselves, but the dark spaces between, where the true structure of the night revealed itself"), shapes her year-long practice (middle: "She learned their rhythms, their pauses, their breaths"), and guides the final inscription ("Her fingers, guided by a year of observed darkness"). Three gates met. The method constrains her approach (gap-focus vs. star-focus) and charges the theme (silence/distance), but the mechanics remain abstract; we never see her apply gap-observation to solve a problem or adjust tactics on the page. Causal work is mild; closure linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Twilight garden is anchored early ("twilight garden high in the silent cliffs... dome of woven stone, open to the sky"), provides spatial detail mid-scene ("between night-blooming jasmine and cold marble benches"), and frames the closure ("Under the fading stars... the garden held its breath"). The garden supplies atmosphere and a stage but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The dome's openness to sky enables star-observation, a mild functional role. Three gates met; moderate atmospheric pressure; no tactical constraint. Mid-6s for coherent presence without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"After the nostalgia ban" anchors the premise (setup: opening line and "old ways... forbidden") but never tightens an on-page decision. The ban's mechanics and enforcement remain vague; no patrol, consequence, or temptation tests her. The timeframe does not track a live clock or escalate pressure within the garden scene. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure participation. The ban is backdrop, not tactic-shaper. Swappability high (could be "after the silence edict" with minor edits). Caps near 4.6 for late/no middle; ornamental use lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is stated as her singular motivation in the second paragraph and drives the structure (year of gap-study, speck-anchor, final inscription). Setup and payoff clear; the desire shapes the ending when the verse "settles into her." However, the motivation is never dramatized in conflict—no friction between wanting verse and cost of exile, no competing desire. It remains a declared goal rather than a choice under pressure. Two-gate presence with thematic coherence; lack of on-page friction and told-only execution hold it in the low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Obsidian grace" appears as descriptor ("movements a language of obsidian grace") and refrain ("testament of obsidian grace") that brackets the arc. Tone is consistently elevated, lyric, and meditative throughout; no modulation under pressure (her trembling at the end is brief, the prose remains ornamental). The phrase charges the final image by reprising, but the tone itself does not escalate or tighten with stakes. Coherent static mood with purposeful reprise meets lyric-resonance allowance; lack of pressure modulation and stakes-charging prevents higher. Mid-6s for early signal, final reprise, and tonal coherence without dynamic range.</comment>
