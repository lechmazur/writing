<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her progression from waiting to action tracks cleanly. Interior moments are embodied ("steely longing," the compass in hand), though the journey through the maintenance corridor feels mechanical—she solves spatial puzzles without meaningful internal friction. The final step into darkness registers as decisive, but the choice arrives without visible cost on the page: no renunciation, no live option foreclosed, just forward motion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal-Situational hybrid: clues accumulate (film flicker, compass behavior, clock frozen at tidal phase) and link to Elara's escape plan, then she acts. Closure is a Charged Poise moment—stepping into the shaft with the chiming clock and "unplanned encore" begun—but the cost remains abstract; we see fear and hope named, not a specific path or relationship foreclosed on the page. Orientation is swift (skybound station, post-departure hours). One tightening occurs when she realizes the compass points to the drain and the clock marks tidal phase, narrowing her tactic to the central shaft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor, film-reel wall, and maintenance spine are vivid and purposeful: the arbor's magnetic tides explain compass behavior, the film canvas hides the latch, the downspout becomes her exit. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform → film wall → corridor → central chamber → shaft). The compass and clock function as micro-setting objects that constrain her route and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting involvement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is escape/transformation, signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful tightening: discovering the compass points downward and the clock marks tidal phase narrows her options to the central shaft. The step into darkness is an act of agency, but the cost is named rather than shown—no specific loss, injury, or renunciation dramatized on the page. Under the Causal-Situational lens, pressure coheres but does not escalate stakes beyond the initial premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: frozen time (clock), hidden pathways (film reel), magnetic tides as metaphor for unseen currents shaping fate. The "unplanned encore" and "surprise fate" frame resonates without overt moralizing. The chiming clock and turning hands offer a lyric, non-literal answer to the premise. Subtext operates in the compass glow and the unfathomable shaft. Minor slip: "strategically creative observation" and "ironclad hope" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing in para 2 and 4.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual filter consistent: music as "wistful counterpoint," air that "pulsed with vertical breath," ozone and old grease. Diction elevates at peaks ("strategically creative clarity," "refuge in motion") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during compass use, wider during corridor transit. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the discovery beats (film flicker, compass spin, tidal-phase realization). Minor loops: "strategically creative" appears twice (para 2, para 3); "invitation" echoes (horizon invites night × 2). Template cadence in para 4: three consecutive sentences open with "The" + noun subject. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "steely longing hardened into resolve" is functional. Clarity holds; no causality breaks. Deduct −0.4 for loops and template stems, keeping the piece shy of high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tidal arbor, magnetic fields as tide, and film-reel doorway offer fresh texture on skybound-station escape premises. The broken clock as tidal-phase marker is a clever specificity. Execution is solid but doesn't transform the template: protagonist discovers clues, navigates hidden passage, escapes downward. Emotional arc and plot remain tightly coupled to the fantastical premise; swap names and the frame is unchanged. No bold structural risk; the piece commits fully to its lyric SF mode without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat. Her choices drive the plot: she investigates the film flicker (setup, end of para 2), follows the compass downward (development, para 4–5), and steps into the shaft (payoff, final para). All three gates met. Causal pressure is present but not high-cost; the decision to descend is prepared but not conflicted on the page. Beat involvement: three distinct (playing piano, discovering latch, navigating corridor, stepping into shaft). Early signal strong. Closure linkage clear. Swappability: medium—any fugitive could perform similar puzzle-solving. Cost connection: the step into darkness is portrayed as hope-laden, not as visible renunciation. Calculation: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost modest +0.3, swappability −0.6, late friction none. Lands ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in three beats: setup (para 1, on piano lid, hands frozen), development (para 3, Elara realizes it marks tidal phase, not time of day), and payoff (para 5, she drops it into shaft; it chimes and the hands "in her mind's eye" begin to turn). All three gates met. Causal pressure: the clock's frozen state is a clue that unlocks the timing mechanism of the arbor. Closure linkage: the chime and turning hands mark the "unplanned encore" begun. Specificity high: the tidal-phase insight is unique to this object. Cost connection: the clock is released, a renunciation of the past. Calculation: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4, no frictions. Lands ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The compass appears in two beats: mid-development (para 3, needle spins then points downward, revealing the magnetic drain) and payoff (para 5, glowing with steady light as she approaches the shaft). Setup gate missing—first mentioned after the 33% mark. Development gate met: the compass's downward pull changes her tactics, directing her to the central shaft. Closure gate met: it glows and is held as she steps into darkness. Causal pressure moderate: the compass reveals the hidden current but does not impose cost. Specificity: "flickering compass" in the prompt becomes "failing" and "frantic" on the page—close synonym. Cost connection weak. Calculation: setup missing (cap 4.6), two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, late appearance (para 3, ~38%) −0.3, swappability (any dowsing tool) −0.5, cost absent −0.0. Lands ~4.8, cap 4.6 overridden by two-beat + closure strength → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" appears twice as a descriptor (para 2 "strategically creative observation," para 3 "strategically creative clarity") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It labels Elara's investigative mindset but does not generate a tradeoff, error, or visible friction. Setup gate: present by para 2. Development gate: not met—no choice is shaped by the trait's specific properties. Payoff gate: not met—absent from the ending. Beat involvement: zero distinct causal beats. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability high (replace with "keen," "inventive," etc.) −0.6. Calculation: setup +0.4, zero beats +0.0, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3. Lands ~3.2, under the missing-development cap of 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Refuge" appears in setup (para 1, "Her refuge was temporary") and payoff (para 4, "a refuge in motion"). Development gate weak: the term recurs but does not constrain a middle choice—Elara's corridor navigation is pursuit, not sheltering. The second use is metaphorical, not a distinct beat. Causal pressure low: the concept frames her waiting but does not alter her tactics. Swappability high: "escape," "flight," "sanctuary" would serve equally. Calculation: setup +0.4, one beat (metaphorical reprise) +0.4, lyric reprise +0.5, causal pressure +0.2, closure linkage +0.5, swappability −0.7, ornamental first use −0.4. Lands ~4.1, just under the missing-development cap of 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The film-reel mechanism appears in setup (para 2, Elara notices flicker and finds the latch behind the film canvas), development (implied—she uses the latch to enter the corridor, though not re-described), and payoff (absent from final para). Setup and development gates met; closure gate missing. Causal pressure strong: the hidden latch is the means of escape, no alternative route offered. Specificity high: "black-and-white film reel" with "sweeping coastal vista" is distinct. Cost connection weak: discovery is easy, no price paid to access it. Calculation: setup +0.7, one beat (discovery and entry, contiguous) +0.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure absent (cap 2.8 overridden by strong causal work) → re-evaluate: two touches (discovery para 2, implicit use para 3) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.7, closure missing −1.0, late resolution (it enables escape but is not revisited at the shaft) −0.3. Lands ~5.9, under missing-closure soft cap but causal strength lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal arbor appears in setup (para 1, greenhouse above clouds with "slow, vertical breath"), development (para 3, magnetic tides rise and fall like the sea, explaining compass and clock behavior), and payoff (para 5, the central shaft at the arbor's core is her exit). All three gates met. Causal pressure high: the arbor's magnetic tides are the key constraint that Elara decodes; the downspout is her only escape route. Closure linkage strong: the shaft yawns in the final chamber and she descends through it. Specificity: the tidal-arbor concept is unique and integral. Cost connection: descent is dangerous, though the price is future-tense. Calculation: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8, cost (implied danger) +0.4. Lands ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "until the horizon invites night" appears in setup (para 1, "She would stay until the horizon invited night, and then she would act") and payoff (para 5, "night finally claimed the sky above" as she steps into the shaft). Development gate weak: the approach of twilight is noted (para 5, "light faded… deepened into twilight") but does not tighten a middle decision. Two touches, setup and payoff. Causal pressure low: night marks the moment she acts but does not impose a cost or narrow options—she could have acted earlier. Lyric reprise clear. Calculation: setup +0.6, two touches +0.9, lyric reprise +0.6, causal pressure +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, cost weak +0.1, development gate missing −0.5. Lands ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To surprise fate with an unplanned encore" appears in setup (para 1, stated as her goal) and payoff (para 5, "The unplanned encore had begun"). Development gate weak: the phrase recurs but does not dramatize a conflicted choice in the corridor—Elara's investigation and descent are smooth. Desire is told, not tested by friction. Two touches, setup and payoff. Causal pressure moderate: the motivation frames her entire action. Cost connection weak: the "encore" metaphor is elegant but the sacrifice or trade-off remains abstract. Calculation: setup +0.7, two touches +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, lyric reprise +0.5, friction absent (told-only want) −0.8, cost weak −0.3. Lands ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Steely longing" appears in setup (para 1, "fingers moved… with steely longing") and development (para 4, "steely longing… hardened into resolve"). Payoff: the tone persists in "equal parts fear and ironclad hope" (para 5). Three touches across the arc. Coherence high: the mood modulates from wistful to resolved without breaking. The final image (stepping into inviting dark) is charged by this tonal control. Calculation: setup +0.7, three touches +1.4, coherence across turns +0.8, closure tone-charge +1.0, cost connection (tone supports the leap) +0.4, static mood (no sharp modulation under peak stress) −0.3. Lands ~6.1.</comment>
