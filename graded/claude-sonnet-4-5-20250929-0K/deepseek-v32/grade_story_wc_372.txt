<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris remains abstract throughout; his "gently meticulous devotion" is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a difficult micro-choice that reveals competing values. Interior states are labeled ("he thought of the vows") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The discovery of embedded vows at line 37 feels unmotivated—no prior scene work establishes why this would surprise him or alter his stance. No visible cost or renunciation forecloses a path; he simply continues his work with renewed purpose, flattening the arc into static competence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: repeated sampling beats build density toward the discovery of intentional vows embedded in illusions. However, the discovery at line 37 ("This discovery could change everything") asserts stakes without showing how options narrow or cost accrues on the page. The ending recycles the opening posture ("forever measuring") without a legible reconfiguration or price paid—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost. The closure unit reads as thematic echo rather than closure with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library, quartz hush, and magic lantern are vivid and purposeful. The lantern slide constrains Aris's method (he must place it carefully, adjust dials) and charges several middle beats. However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure—the final image returns to preparatory stillness without the setting altering tactics or the ending's weight. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (coldness, crystalline air, soft whine of instruments) and filtered through Aris's archivist priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving fading illusions—is signaled early. The piece offers one micro turn: the discovery of embedded vows at line 37. Yet this discovery does not narrow options or force a trade-off; Aris simply documents faster without visible cost or a tactical shift. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live path. The resolution returns to the opening status quo ("prepared for the next day") without agency-driven escalation or consequence, flattening pressure into a descriptive loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—meaning salvaged from oblivion—emerges from Aris's labor and the discovery that some illusions carry intentional vows. However, the final paragraph restates this theme overtly ("forever measuring the light that others let slip away") rather than letting the image resonate. The piece leans on prompt vocabulary ("luminous vows," "conjuring meaning from oblivion") as thematic shortcuts instead of letting particulars accumulate into fresh insight. No non-literal answer reweights the question; the ending affirms the premise without complexity or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and matches the archival register ("gently meticulous," "quartz hush," "memory-crystals"). However, repeated sentence stems flatten rhythm: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating template cadence in the middle third. Psychic distance is consistent but offers no perceptual signature—Aris notices what the reader needs to know rather than revealing biased, character-specific selection. No purposeful compression or experimental pattern is taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; grammar and syntax are clean. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "illusions faded to memory" recurs six times with minor variations; "gently meticulous" appears thrice without functional reweighting. Lines 33–35 restate the same content ("translating ephemeral light into durable data" / "luminous vows demanded no less" / "covenants to preserve"). Template cadence ("He sampled…," "He recorded…," "He adjusted…") runs across four consecutive paragraphs in the middle third without taught pattern or payoff. Filter-verb stacks ("he thought," "he realized," "he glimpsed") dull immediacy in high-density beats. Apply cumulative artifact penalty: −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—archivist measuring fading illusions in a frozen sky library—is atmospheric but derivative of archival-fantasy templates (memoria, celestial archives). The discovery of embedded vows offers a plot turn but no fresh moral calculus or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional arc (diligent work → discovery → renewed diligence) mirrors familiar "keeper of lost things" structures. Specificity is gestural: "magic lantern slide," "sampling frequencies," "quartz hush" function as genre markers rather than irreplaceable particulars that transform the frame. No bold risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout and his role (records chief) frames the premise. However, he makes no key decision that alters tactics or stakes; he continues sampling before and after the discovery. Observation without agency trends low under the rubric's causality test.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lantern slide appears in beats at lines 7, 9, 18, 26, and 49, enabling the sampling method and framing closure preparation. It constrains mechanics (must be placed carefully, brass holder) and charges middle scenes. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; line 49 ("awaited its next duty") recycles its earlier function without transformation. Two gates (setup, development) met; closure participation is cameo only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" recurs as thematic label throughout (lines 6, 20, 34, 38, 44) and the discovery at line 38 links vows to illusions. However, this discovery does not narrow options or impose cost—Aris simply documents them. The concept shapes theme but not on-page stakes or tactics. Label-only use without dramatized tradeoff trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears at lines 2, 15, 29, and 47 as narrative assertion. It describes Aris's work style but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost (e.g., slowness that risks loss, over-caution that misses a signal). Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Measure" and "measurement" drive beats at lines 11, 13, 16, 19, 23, 28, 39–42, structuring the work across all three thirds. The action enables the discovery at line 38 and frames closure preparation. However, the action is swappable with "record" or "capture" without altering story logic; no unique property of measurement (precision, time cost, failure risk) shapes a turn. Functional across beats but replaceable in specifics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" appears at lines 12–13, 16, 23, 28, 32, 39, and 42, shaping the method throughout. Mechanics are signaled (dial adjustment, soft whine, vibrational hum) and the method enables the vow discovery. However, "frequencies" could be replaced with "patterns" or "echoes" with minor edits; no unique cost or constraint of frequency-sampling (interference, bandwidth limits) alters tactics. One gate (setup and development) met; closure participation is summary only ("sampled, and saved").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The frozen library and sea of clouds anchor setting throughout. Cold seeps from walls (line 27), quartz hush deepens (line 21), and the library's elevation ("above the clouds") recurs at lines 1, 24, 45. However, the setting supplies atmosphere without pressuring choice—no spatial constraint (cold dulling instruments, altitude limiting stamina) alters Aris's tactics. Postcard description without micro-setting cost trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Illusions fade to memory" recurs six times as framing condition and the phrase "while this dissolution occurred" (line 5) signals time pressure. However, no live clock or urgency shapes decisions; Aris works at his own pace and the ending promises "the next day" without consequence for delay. Time is thematic backdrop, not tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" appears at lines 5, 20, 33, 43, framing motivation. The discovery at line 38 dramatizes this desire ("meaning was not just extracted but intentionally left"). However, no friction between want and cost is dramatized—Aris pursues his goal without sacrifice, doubt, or competing desire. Told motivation without on-page conflict trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" appears at lines 3, 21, 41, anchoring tone as crystalline stillness. Tone remains consistent and modulates slightly at line 36 ("worked faster now") during the discovery beat. The final image ("silent partner in the dance against time") carries tonal echo. However, the tone does not charge the closure with new meaning or cost; it frames rather than reweights. Coherent but static mood trends mid-band.</comment>
