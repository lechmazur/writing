<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Leo is a label-only construct—"cryptic fortune cookie writer" with "spycraft microdot film specs"—whose interiority never contradicts or complicates his stated role. Eliza materializes as a passive recipient whose "fear" is asserted, not embodied; her arc from "lonely librarian" to apprentice occurs in summary ("Inspired, she joined him") without on-page friction or visible cost. The piece recounts motivations and transformations rather than dramatizing them, and emotional states are declared ("The familiar enigma of Leo's existence became clear to Eliza") without contradiction or struggle. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the prose explains rather than shows character in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when are signaled by ~line 1 (lighthouse, Leo, "tonight"), waiving the penalty. Drive lens: the piece attempts Causal but repeatedly collapses into summary ("This was an open secret…"; "By orchestrating these disclosures, Leo aimed to shift perspectives"). The dominant stake—Leo guiding others via fortunes—is stated early but never tightens or deepens on the page; Eliza's cookie-to-lighthouse journey is recounted in past summary, not dramatized with cost. Closure form: Eliza becomes an apprentice and they "continue to orchestrate change," a steady-state declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. No on-page moment where options narrow, a path forecloses, or the final image reweights prior material; the ending summarizes ongoing activity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, rocky island, and mainland pub are named but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is vague—Eliza's journey from mainland to island after last orders is recounted in a single line without sensory anchor or proximity detail. Micro-setting opportunity (microdot specs, jars of fortune slips) is described but never handled under pressure; no tool or object constrains Leo's or Eliza's actions. The setting remains postcard décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled (Leo guiding community via fortunes), but no on-page tightening or reversal occurs; each beat restates the premise rather than escalating pressure. Eliza's fortune ("The key you seek is within the lock you fear") is recounted as having already worked off-page; her confrontation with the archives and discovery of her grandfather's legacy are summarized, not dramatized. Agency is absent—Leo places fortunes, they come true, people change—without choice under pressure or visible cost. The ending restates ongoing activity ("orchestrating hope one cryptic message at a time") rather than resolving tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated throughout: "open secrets," "transposing lives into new keys," "guardian of truths, a weaver of fates." The final paragraph's "open secrets and accidentally prophetic words" summarizes the thesis rather than offering a non-literal answer through image or action. The piece tells its theme rather than allowing it to emerge from particulars; no recurring image shifts meaning at closure, and the lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor is explained ("symbolized his method: illuminating hidden paths") rather than embodied. Thematic echo penalty: multiple prompt-phrase declarations replace earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>POV is third-person limited around Leo but frequently leaks into exposition ("These were truths known in whispers…"; "This was an open secret in the town, but no one had dared to tell Eliza"). Narrative distance oscillates between close interiority and Wikipedia-voice summary without purpose; key moments (Eliza cracking the cookie, meeting Leo) are recounted rather than shown in scene. Diction is generically literary ("familiar enigma," "rhythmic beam") without character-particular texture; no perceptual signature or bias. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "By orchestrating these disclosures, Leo aimed to shift perspectives, transposing lives into new keys" restates lines 6 and 13; "After last orders" recurs six times as scaffold without earned pattern. Template cadence runs stack ("He had been…"; "After last orders in his own life, when his service ended, he sought…"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh particulars: "silent sentinel," "weaver of fates," "beacon of mystery." Mixed register: "spycraft microdot film specs" clashes with "familiar enigma" and "rhythmic beam." Artifact spread reaches the closure paragraph ("open secrets and accidentally prophetic words"), triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The premise—cryptic fortune cookies as life-guidance tool—is a widely used template (wise mentor dispensing cryptic wisdom) executed without transformation. "Open secrets," "transpose life into a new key," "accidentally prophetic" are prompt labels repeated as decoration rather than explored through specific lived consequence. The microdot specs and lighthouse setting feel bolted on; the specs miniaturize messages but that detail does not constrain choice or create friction. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; the story could swap Leo for a tarot reader or astrologer with minor edits. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Leo writes fortunes and places them; his role is described but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. His motivation is stated ("to transpose life into a new key") but not dramatized through choice under pressure. Eliza joins him in the final third, but her apprenticeship is recounted in summary. Label-only use, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The microdot specs appear in line 2 ("adjusted his spycraft microdot film specs") and return in backstory (line 26: "souvenir from those days") and when Eliza learns to use them (line 27). Static description across all three mentions; no evolving use, no constraint on choice. Present in setup and briefly at closure, but ornamental. Two-gate attendance (setup, closure cameo) suggests ~5.0 ceiling, but swappability (any miniaturization tool would serve) and lack of causal pressure lower the score. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; ornamental mention −0.5, plus late closure cameo without causal role −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Open secrets" are named repeatedly (lines 4, 11, 20, 28, 38) and frame the premise: truths "known in whispers" that Leo brings to light. The concept shapes the dominant stake (revealing community knowledge) but no on-page choice pivots on the open-vs-hidden tension; each fortune's effect is recounted in summary. Present in setup, middle exposition, and the final sentence, meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is thin—Leo's method works off-page—but the concept organizes tactics. Early signal +0.5, three-gate attendance +0.3, but summary-only use −0.4, swappability (any hidden-truth method) −0.4, no closure-beat pressure −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is declared in line 7 and restated in lines 28 and 38. The trait is explained ("his fortunes had a habit of coming true in unforeseen ways") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost; Leo's fortunes work off-page, and the mechanism is asserted rather than tested. Label-only across all mentions. Setup present +0.3, but no beat involvement, no causal pressure, closure mention is decorative. Late final appearance in closing summary −0.1, ornamental −0.5, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" and "orchestrating" appear in lines 5, 13, 23, 24, 29, 37. The action frames Leo's method—placing fortunes to guide outcomes—but the orchestration occurs off-page (Eliza's journey, the pub keeper's recognition). No on-page scene shows Leo orchestrating under pressure; the verb is descriptive rather than dramatized. Present in setup, middle, and closure sentence, meeting all three gates, but easily swappable with "arrange," "coordinate," or "direct." Three-gate attendance +0.3, early signal +0.3, but summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5, no closure causal role −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Directing flow" (lines 5, 12, 23, 29) describes Leo's method: channeling information via fortunes. The means is signaled early and restated, but the mechanics (how cookies reach targets, how flow is directed) remain vague. No on-page attempt shaped by this method; Leo places fortunes and they arrive off-page. Setup and closure mentions present, middle development is exposition. Two-gate attendance (setup, closure) suggests ~5.0 ceiling, but lack of mechanical specificity and dramatized use lower the score. Early signal +0.4, but ornamental middle −0.4, summary-only −0.5, swappability ("guiding," "channeling") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse on a rocky island is named in line 1, serves as Leo's home/workshop (line 9), and is Eliza's destination (line 22) and their shared base (line 29, 38). Setting is present across all three gates (setup, middle as workspace, closure as ongoing base) but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The island's isolation is stated but not leveraged—Eliza arrives without obstacle, and the mainland-to-island journey is recounted in one line. Three-gate attendance +0.6, early anchor +0.4, but postcard description −0.6, no tactical constraint −0.5, no closure pressure −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After last orders" recurs in lines 1, 14, 21, 26, 37 as a time marker (pub closing). The timeframe signals evening/night work but never tightens a decision or creates urgency. No live clock; events unfold in summary across unspecified duration. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, but the phrase is scaffold rather than pressure. Three-gate attendance +0.3, but vague tracking −0.5, no tactical constraint −0.6, decorative repetition −0.3, template artifact (repeated six times without escalation) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To transpose life into a new key" appears in lines 6, 13, 23, and the closing motif. The motivation frames Leo's goal and is echoed when Eliza's life is "transposed" (line 23), but the desire is never dramatized through on-page friction or choice under pressure. Leo's aim is declared, fortunes work off-page, outcomes are recounted. Setup and closure present, middle is exposition. Early signal +0.4, closure echo +0.3, but told-only across all uses −0.7, no friction between want and cost −0.5, swappability (any transformation metaphor) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" appears in lines 8, 26, 36. Tone aims for mystery and circularity but remains static—each mention restates "enigma" without modulation. The piece does not shift cadence or register under pressure; the final paragraph's "mysterious lighthouse" and "cryptic message" echo the opening without reweighting. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Three-gate attendance +0.3, but single static mood −0.4, label repetition without charge −0.5, no pressure modulation −0.4.</comment>
