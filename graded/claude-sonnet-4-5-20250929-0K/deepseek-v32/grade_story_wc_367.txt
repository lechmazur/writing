<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to shape storms using ancient patterns—is present but remains abstract; his "otherworldly routine" and centuries of practice are told rather than shown through conflicting impulses. The "shadowed elation" is labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction (joy vs. sorrow of ships he could not save is claimed, not dramatized in a present micro-choice). His agency at closure—adjusting prisms to steer the storm—lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed; the reef's emergence and his descent feel like outcomes he observes rather than choices that narrow options. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("profound shadowed elation," "bittersweet peal") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Kael), where (emerald lighthouse), and when (after print news, evening storm) adequately by ~120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through repeated images (laughter, glass wick, beam, storm) and a ritual cadence. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the storm peaks, the reef emerges, stars reappear, and Kael descends satisfied—but the cost is asserted ("weight of knowledge he carried alone") rather than made legible in a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The "new dawn forming from night's turmoil" is a thematic claim; no on-page action or renunciation visibly forecloses a path or reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, spiral stairs, green stone pulse, and prisms are vividly sketched. Sensory detail—wind slapping windows, illuminated rain, towering waves—supports atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the tower's "core flame" and prisms enable Kael's ritual but do not constrain a choice (he adjusts lenses "with infinite care" but no obstacle or cost is tied to that adjustment). The glass lantern wick appears early and late but does not alter tactics mid-scene. Missing the 9+ gate: no on-page moment where environment or tool narrows options or charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—steering the storm to shape a new dawn—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should manifest as density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead, the piece cycles through preparation, storm arrival, beam activation, peak, and ebb without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows Kael's options. The reef's emergence is observed, not earned by a choice that forecloses an alternative. No visible price (time, tool failure, moral calculus) alters later tactics; Kael's laughter and satisfaction at descent imply success without trade-off. The storm "summoned in part by his own presence" hints at agency but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme—using ancient shadows to shape renewal—emerges from the ritual and imagery (old storms, hidden reef, scrubbed air). The "accidentally prophetic" snippets and "shadowed elation" suggest complexity, but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "He had used the ancient shadows to steer the world…toward a gentler light." This replaces scene pressure with authorial summary. No concrete image reweights prior material; the glass wick's cooling and "new day forming" are told resolutions. The piece invites reflection on renewal and control but does not earn a non-literal answer through the ending's particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a heightened, archaic register ("vault of infinite stars," "guiding blade," "delicate glass lantern wick") that reads consistent but tonally uniform—Kael's perception under peak storm pressure uses the same elevated diction as his calm preparation. Perceptual signature is generic (he "saw," "felt," "watched") rather than selectively biased. The phrase "accidentally prophetic, snippets of old songs foretelling waves" tells the trait without showing mismatched knowledge or a concrete irony. Psychic distance remains stable but does not modulate with scene intensity. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Rhythm varies somewhat (short bursts during the storm peak, longer sentences in reflection), but template cadence appears: "He [verb]" stems recur across adjacent lines ("He checked," "He began," "He laughed," "He adjusted," "He knew," "He descended"). Paraphrase loop: "shadowed elation" is defined twice in close proximity ("bittersweet peal," "joy woven with sorrow"). Stock metaphors: "guiding blade" for light, "coming gale" for laughter. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt," "He watched") stack in the storm sequence without urgency shift. Figurative density in the final third ("beam carved through the night," "path for wildness," "air scrubbed clean") does not obscure clarity but adds ornament without propulsion. Apply −0.6 for template stems and loops; artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("He descended, his laughter now a quiet, satisfied sound"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper premise and storm-as-metaphor are familiar; the "otherworldly routine" and "ancient shadows for renewal" add a fantastical layer but remain abstract. The twist—Kael shapes storms rather than merely warning ships—is present but underexploited (no on-page moment where his choice between warning and shaping creates friction). The "accidentally prophetic" attribute and total internal reflection are specific details, yet neither transforms the arc in a non-obvious way. The emotional beat (lone keeper bearing knowledge, joy mixed with sorrow) reads as stock. Transformation test: swap Kael for another keeper and the emerald tower for a different beacon, and the plot and emotional arc hold unchanged. No fresh inflection at closure; the reef's reveal and dawn's promise are outcomes Kael observes rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: Kael introduced immediately. Development: adjusts lenses mid-scene. Closure: descends satisfied. Two gates clear; middle involvement is observation-heavy (he watches the storm respond) rather than decision-driven. His choices (check wick, align lenses, adjust prisms) do not narrow options or create visible cost. Swappable with another keeper performing ritual tasks. Apply early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, but swappability −0.6 and observation-only middle −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "delicate glass lantern wick" introduced early with technical detail (fused silica, total internal reflection). Development: "began to glow, a thread of pure white" at storm peak. Closure: "cooled, its duty done." Three gates; the wick appears in two distinct beats (preparation, peak) and is named at closure. However, its properties (cool, perfect form) do not constrain a choice or impose cost; the glow is automatic once Kael completes his ritual. Swappable with another light source. Apply early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental peak use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "otherworldly routine, polished by centuries" introduced in paragraph one. Development: the routine structures the scene (climb, check wick, align lenses, ritual) but does not create friction or alter stakes—it is a backdrop. Closure: "until the next otherworldly routine" is a summary callback without reweighting. The concept frames expectation but remains thematic rather than tactical. Apply early signal +0.4, one beat (framing) +0.4, but ornamental use −0.7 and swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup: "accidentally prophetic" introduced mid-first-third. Development: "snippets of old songs foretelling waves" and later "each one manifesting in the crack of lightning or the shape of a wave." The trait is told and illustrated, but it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—Kael hums and his words come true without friction. Closure: the buried reef's emergence is framed as fulfillment of his earlier words, but he does not wrestle with prophecy vs. intent. Swappable with any minor foresight ability. Apply early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4, but label-only −0.7, no cost −0.6, swappability −0.5, and late first appearance (mid-first-third is borderline) −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "his task now was to steer" appears at storm arrival. Development: "By focusing the beam…he could guide the storm's energy" and "adjusted the prisms minutely, steering the light's angle." Closure: "The storm, steered by his light, was scouring the sand away." Three gates; "steer" is the verb for his core action across multiple beats. However, the act is told rather than dramatized with obstacles or cost; the storm responds obediently. Specificity is moderate (prism adjustment) but the outcome (reef revealed, calmer seas) arrives without trade-off. Apply early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but summary-only execution −0.7 and no cost connection −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "through total internal reflection, bending endlessly within the emerald prisms" introduced early. Development: mentioned again at peak ("through total internal reflection, he could guide the storm's energy") and later ("The beam, through total internal reflection, now touched the crest of each towering wave"). Closure: not named in final moves. The method is labeled three times but its mechanics do not matter—no moment where refraction angle, prism alignment failure, or reflection limit creates pressure. Swappable with "focused the beam" or any light-bending method. Apply early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7, and missing closure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "emerald lighthouse" and "vault of infinite stars" anchored in first paragraph. Development: tower's green stone pulse, spiral stairs, and prisms are named; the beam's interaction with waves is shown. Closure: "The emerald lighthouse stood firm, its beam softening to a watchful gleam." Three gates; the lighthouse is present across the arc and named at closure. The setting supplies resources (prisms, core flame) that enable Kael's action, but it does not constrain a choice (no prism failure, no storm threat to the tower itself). The stars frame atmosphere but do not alter tactics. Apply early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but missing constraint on choice −0.7 and postcard description −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setup: "after the last print newspaper" mentioned in first paragraph. Development: "The last print newspaper was ash long ago" restated mid-scene but does not affect Kael's choices or the storm's timing. Closure: not referenced. The timeframe is a worldbuilding detail without causal role; no ticking clock, no urgency tied to this era. Swappable with any post-industrial setting. Apply early signal +0.3, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7, missing middle and closure −1.0 (missing two gates cap 3.4), and decorative mention −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" introduced in first paragraph. Development: the motivation recurs ("This was the shaping he intended—using the past's hidden dangers to chart a safer future") but is told rather than dramatized through a conflicting want or cost. Closure: "He had used the ancient shadows to steer the world…toward a gentler light" restates the motivation without friction. The desire frames the ritual but does not create a choice between competing goods or a visible trade-off. Apply early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but told-only −0.8, no friction −0.6, and thematic echo in final paragraph −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: "shadowed elation" introduced early ("sharp with shadowed elation"). Development: "profound shadowed elation, a joy woven with the sorrow" at peak; tone is named and explained. Closure: "his laughter now a quiet, satisfied sound" modulates to resolution. The tone is consistent and modulates with scene turns (sharp → profound → quiet). However, it is labeled rather than embodied in diction or rhythm shifts; the prose remains elevated and archaic throughout. The final image carries satisfaction but the "shadowed" layer dissipates into simple contentment. Apply early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but label-only execution −0.7 and static mood register −0.3.</comment>
