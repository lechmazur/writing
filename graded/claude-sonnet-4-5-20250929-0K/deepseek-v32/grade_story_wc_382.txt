<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alex's motivation to learn building language is present but remains largely abstract; the "agreed upon lies" frame gives texture but his interior contradiction never fully dramatizes a micro-choice under pressure. Mrs. Elara is more vivid ("patiently nimble," her cryptic analogies) yet functions primarily as guide rather than pressure source. The rooftop confrontation ("But that's one of our lies, isn't it?") gestures toward a pivot but the epiphany arrives via exposition rather than embodied cost. The final acceptance reads earned in concept but lacks a visible forfeiture that would anchor the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Alex, top-floor apartment, rooftop access). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: weekly tea sessions build a pattern, the rooftop meteor shower deepens it, and the final image attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "they would keep speaking in agreed upon lies"). Cost is implied—Alex abandons literal translation—but the price remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The seal's cold weight in his pocket is a good try, yet the closure lacks a visible forfeiture or reweighted tactic that would make the cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is vivid and multi-sensory ("twining vines," "night-blooming jasmine," "wet leaves") and constrains the peak conversation spatially. The antique seal is handled across beats (stamps lesson notes, brought to rooftop, placed in Alex's hand, weighs in his pocket) with purposeful recurrence. However, neither environment nor object forces a tactical choice with visible cost; they charge atmosphere more than they alter options. The micro-setting standard is met but not exceeded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the language of buildings—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the weekly ritual and crystallizes in the rooftop interrogation ("What are we really doing here?"). Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the final acceptance ("they would keep speaking in agreed upon lies") reweights the premise. Yet the escalation is conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift makes the cost legible. The move from literal desire to metaphoric attunement lands as theme rather than stakes-driven choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "agreed upon lies" concept integrates organically through borrowed sugar, sealed notes, and cryptic analogies without overt statement. The final image—"a key to nothing, and to everything"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the literal-translation desire. Mrs. Elara's explanation ("The lies we agreed upon were doors") borders on thematic summary but stays within character voice. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy closure, though the peak beat leans slightly toward articulation rather than implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Alex with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Prose carries a distinct texture ("weathered," "claw-foot desk," "contented groan") and the narrative stance modulates purposefully (curiosity → puzzlement → urgency → acceptance). Mrs. Elara's dialogue feels character-particular ("The sky will be speaking too," "languages die when their last speaker dies"). Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the rooftop confrontation. No major slips touch the closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "one of immense quiet," "a syntax she promised to teach," and the final paragraph's nested abstractions ("the patient, nimble act of perception itself") drift toward summary. The rooftop beat ("her eyes glinting," "her profile etched in cool light") stacks visual filters without fresh pressure. Paraphrase loop: "agreed upon lies" recurs five times, sometimes ornamentally. The closure image is strong but the approach loses propulsion in the penultimate lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "language of old buildings" frame and the mentor-student dynamic are familiar, but the piece transforms them through the "agreed upon lies" scaffold and the seal as authentication ritual. The rooftop meteor-shower setting is less common and integrates thematically. Emotional specificity (Alex's "need for truth," the "comfortable, puzzling haze") elevates the template. However, the arc—literal seeker learns metaphoric truth from cryptic guide—follows a recognizable pattern, and the final epiphany arrives via explanation rather than a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mrs. Elara appears early (first evening), drives the weekly tea pattern, announces the rooftop lesson, and delivers the key explanation at closure. Her cryptic analogies shape Alex's understanding across beats. However, her primary function is guide rather than antagonist; she does not constrain Alex's choices so much as offer them. The rooftop turn is her revelation, not a decision that costs her. Two of three gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is indirect. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but limited causal pressure and no visible cost to her. Band guidance suggests ~6.5–7.0; rounding down yields 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seal is introduced early ("claw-foot desk"), stamps lesson notes (beat one), is brought to the rooftop (beat two), placed in Alex's hand (beat three), and weighs in his pocket at closure (beat four). Its meaning shifts from authentication ritual to commitment marker to "key to nothing, and to everything." All three gates met. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. However, the seal does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost; its work is symbolic rather than causal. Band guidance suggests ~7.0–7.5; conservatively 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named in the first third, frames the weekly tea sessions, surfaces in Alex's interrogation ("that's one of our lies, isn't it?"), and anchors the final image ("they would keep speaking in agreed upon lies"). All three gates met. The concept shapes Alex's understanding and Mrs. Elara's pedagogy, reweighting his literal desire. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5. However, the lies do not narrow a live tactical choice on the page; their function is thematic scaffold rather than pressure source. Cost is conceptual (abandoning literalism) but not dramatized. Band ~6.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" describes Mrs. Elara's movement three times ("moved with a patiently nimble grace," "movements even more fluid and light," "patiently nimble fingers tracing the seal"). Setup present, payoff ornamental (final mention is label-only). The trait colors her character but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. No middle development beat. Two gates (setup, weak payoff). Early signal +0.4, ornamental closure mention +0.2, swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development). Band ~4.0–4.5; conservatively 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The interrogation ("But that's one of our lies, isn't it?" / "What are we really doing here?") triggers Mrs. Elara's explanation and the conceptual shift at closure. Introduced at the rooftop climax (setup blurred but present in prior "need for truth"), drives the key turn, and payoff is the final acceptance. Early signal weak (−0.3), one major beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4. However, the action itself is brief and the heavy lifting is done by Mrs. Elara's reply; Alex's role is prompt rather than decision. Swappability moderate (another question could serve). Band ~6.5–7.0; conservatively 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar (first evening) initiates contact, turns into weekly tea sessions (middle pattern), and the ritual frames the final acceptance ("He would keep coming for tea"). All three gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats (initiation, pattern) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. The method enables the relationship and the "slow, careful attunement" Mrs. Elara describes, but does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost. Its work is scaffold rather than pressure. Band ~5.5–6.0; conservatively 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is introduced early (first evening, "neglected"), reappears as lesson site ("next lesson would be during the Perseid meteor shower"), and the meteor shower charges the peak conversation and final image ("the silent shower above reflecting in the wet leaves"). All three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats (announcement, climax) +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, sensory specificity +0.6. The setting pressures the conversation spatially (parapet, open sky) and tonally (celestial display), though it does not force a tactical choice. Band ~7.0–7.5; conservatively 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alex's desire "to learn the language of old buildings" is named in the opening line, drives his neighbor outreach and tea sessions, surfaces in the rooftop interrogation, and reweights at closure ("the language was in the patient, nimble act of perception itself"). All three gates met. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +0.8. However, the motivation remains largely abstract; no on-page micro-choice dramatizes a friction between this want and a competing cost. The shift from literal to metaphoric is told more than shown. Band ~7.0–7.5; conservatively 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is established early ("the tone of their meetings one of mysterious familiarity, as if they were resuming a long-interrupted conversation"), sustained through the "comfortable, puzzling haze," intensifies during the rooftop ("her eyes glinting," meteor-charged atmosphere), and anchors the final image ("a familiar mystery settled between them"). All three gates met. Early signal +0.8, coherent modulation across beats +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, pervasive texture +0.7. The tone charges perception and the final acceptance without obscuring clarity. Band ~7.5–8.0; conservatively 7.8.</comment>
