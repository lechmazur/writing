<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's skills are labeled (identifying walks, internal map) but never constrain a choice under pressure—the rival already knew she'd come, the coin slot was discovered weeks ago, and the petition exists off-page. The rival's motivation collapses into cartoon villainy ("I have the authority to remove you") without visible stakes of his own. Interiority is clean but relies on stock phrasing: "her voice soft but carrying clearly," "calculated expression of spontaneity." The ending grants Elara total vindication without visible cost or path foreclosed; she emerges secure "not by force, but by the far-reaching power of a whisper" in a summary that tells rather than embodies renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence; no penalty. The closure unit—petition reveal plus rival's understanding—lands on the page, but cost is absent: Elara loses nothing, risks nothing after descending, and the petition (off-page signatures) resolves a conflict it did not help create on these pages. The key's function is declared ("keys for doors") then immediately demonstrated with no friction, flattening causality into a treasure-hunt checklist. Drive lens reads hybrid (causal setup, accumulative whisper-motif, situational storm pressure), but the ending collapses all three into thematic summary without a felt before/after in her position or tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly sketched—"steel canyons," auroras, static-filled radio—and the hidden slot that "only appeared in certain light" charges one choice (coin insertion). Spatial choreography remains clear across junctions and the descent. The zodiac symbol matching the coin delivers purposeful recurrence that constrains the path, lifting the category. Storm effects (wind drowning the manager's shout, lights flickering at peak) modulate pressure selectively rather than serving as static backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove whispers > shouts to save her place—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara hears the manager and "melts into shadows," demonstrating her method, but the descent and petition discovery proceed without reversals or visible cost. The petition itself is a deus ex machina: off-page support that required no on-page persuasion or trade-off. The rival's immediate capitulation ("understood") skips the confrontation the setup promised, replacing earned escalation with thematic summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The whispers/shouts premise integrates through action (silent evasion vs. the manager's lost shout) and object (folded maps, coin as "tools of subtlety"), reaching a image-driven answer in the final paragraph. However, the ending states the theme twice—first in Elara's dialogue ("prove that whispers travel farther"), then in narrative summary ("her whispers had woven a network")—over-literalizing what the petition reveal should embody. The particulars (echoes, zodiac navigation) shape tactics more than they reweight prior moral calculus, leaving the thematic question resolved but not deepened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is consistent: "steel canyons," "echoes," "whisper against the steel." Dialogue carries subtext in the rival's challenge and Elara's calm reply, though "calculated expression of spontaneity, as if she'd just thought of it" tells what should be shown in gesture. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she recognized") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. Voice modulates with pressure—short sentences at the coin insertion, summary calm at closure—without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance goal or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at turns, longer sentences in setup). Minor scaffold appears: "Tonight, however" and "Yet she knew" are boilerplate connectors; "a whisper against the steel" at line ~12 echoes "whispers travel farther than shouts" without added charge until the payoff. No paraphrase loops. The phrase "calculated spontaneity" recurs three times (title concept, mid-story, smile beat) but each use shifts context slightly, avoiding pure repetition. One mixed metaphor: "whispers…gathering strength until they became a roar" contradicts the whisper/shout binary the story champions, though the intent is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth-worker premise and hidden-room discovery follow familiar treasure-hunt/workplace-underdog templates. The whisper-vs-shout theme, zodiac navigation, and "key with no apparent lock" riddle are executed competently but lack a non-obvious synthesis—removing the container setting and substituting any maze would leave the arc unchanged. The petition twist (off-page ally network) is a stock vindication move. The geomagnetic storm adds atmosphere but does not alter tactics or stakes in a way unique to this premise. No bold structural risk or lived specificity transforms the template into something irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as maintenance worker seeds her internal map skill (setup present) and she navigates the labyrinth in multiple beats (middle development). The closure beat hinges on the petition, not a maintenance-specific choice, weakening payoff participation. Her occupation enables access but does not constrain her final tactic; any insider could insert the coin. Causal role in navigation + early signal + specificity (routine inspection, years of echoes) place the score in mid-band, but closure detachment and swappability (any worker with access fits) cap upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in paragraph four (setup), is handled ("felt warm") and compared to the container symbol mid-story (development), then inserted into the slot to open the passage (payoff in final third). Three distinct beats, causal enabler (unlocks descent), and specificity (astrological engraving, grandfather gift, matches faded symbol) demonstrate integration. However, the coin does not return or reweight in the closure beat itself—the petition and rival's reaction carry that moment—so closure linkage is indirect. Strong middle integration and setup seed lift the score; missing direct closure charge and late first physical use (~25% mark) limit the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Folded maps appear in paragraph three with "hidden markings only she understood" (setup) and recur in the hidden room ("walls lined with folded maps") and final image ("She folded her map, tucking it away"). Present in three beats, but the maps never constrain a choice—Elara's internal memory guides her, and the wall maps are decorative discoveries, not tactical tools. The concept echoes thematically (subtlety, hidden knowledge) but does not narrow options or enable a turn. Ornamental recurrence without causal pressure places the score in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's walk-identification skill is seeded early ("identify any intruder by their walk") and demonstrated once when she recognizes the port manager's "heavy, confident stride" and evades him. One beat involvement, early signal, and specificity present. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—she could evade by sight or sound of voice with identical outcome. No payoff at closure; the rival emerges but his gait is not mentioned. Functional in one beat but easily swappable; no visible trade-off tied to the skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The challenge (anonymous note) frames the inciting action (setup in paragraph five), drives Elara's descent and room discovery (middle beats), and the petition reveal directly answers "find the heart…or lose your place forever" (closure payoff). All three gates met, and the challenge is causally indispensable—without it, the story loses stakes and structure. However, the challenge itself is generic (treasure-hunt prompt) and could be rewritten as any ultimatum with minor edits, capping irreplaceability. Strong setup-development-payoff chain and closure linkage place the score solidly in essential range, but modest specificity prevents ceiling reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The key is introduced with the challenge note (setup, paragraph five), Elara reflects on it ("keys for doors") mid-story, and she inserts it into the wall seam to reveal the petition (payoff). Present in three beats with clear causal role (unlocks final evidence). However, the key's "no apparent lock" riddle is stated then immediately solved without friction or failed attempts—Elara knows the answer and executes in one move, flattening the method into a prop. Early signal and closure linkage lift the score; lack of constrained choice or visible cost (no wrong attempts, no trade-off) caps upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is anchored in paragraph one, pressures navigation choices (evasion of manager, echoes guiding movement), supplies the hidden slot and descent passage (resources tied to setting specificity), and the final emergence into "storm-washed night" closes the frame. Setup, development (spatial tactics across multiple beats), and payoff all present. The setting is irreplaceable—no generic maze offers containers, zodiac symbols, port electronics, and the vertical/horizontal labyrinth logic. Micro-setting (coin slot, narrow passage) alters tactics with visible constraint. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity place the score in essential range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is seeded in the opening ("overhead…disrupting port electronics"), complicates communication ("static made her radio crackle"), and peaks at closure ("reached its peak, and the lights flickered"). Setup and payoff present; middle involvement is atmospheric (wind, auroras) but does not tighten decisions—Elara's internal map already bypasses electronics, and the storm does not impose a live countdown or force tactical changes. Time pressure is declared ("before the storm ends") but never tested; the story does not track duration or show the storm ending imminently. Functional across beats but replaceable with any atmospheric deadline; no visible cost or choice tied to storm mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The whispers-vs-shouts motivation is stated in paragraph five, dramatized in the evasion beat (Elara melts into shadows while the manager shouts), restated in dialogue with the rival, and confirmed in the petition reveal (whispers gathered support). Setup, development (one on-page demonstration), and payoff present. However, the friction is thin—Elara never doubts the premise or pays a cost for quiet methods; the rival's shout-based incompetence is told, not shown failing on the page. The desire drives structure but lacks internal contradiction or visible trade-off, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" appears as chapter/framing concept (paragraph six: "plan was one of calculated spontaneity"), recurs in Elara's smile ("calculated expression of spontaneity, as if she'd just thought of it"), and implicitly colors her tactics (appearing to wander, precise moves). Tone is coherent and modulates lightly (calm setup, shadow evasion, quiet confrontation), but remains static rather than charging the final image—the ending summarizes her proof in past-tense reflection, flattening the live pressure. Present across beats with thematic echo, but ornamental rather than shaping closure pressure; no felt cost or tonal shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
