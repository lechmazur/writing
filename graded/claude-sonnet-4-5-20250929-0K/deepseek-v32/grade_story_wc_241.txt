<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her "theoretically rebellious" nature is asserted through narration rather than shown through difficult micro-choices with visible costs. The father remains a passive recipient in the garden scene; no meaningful relationship pressure forces a choice that alters their dynamic. Interior reflection dominates, yet the final lantern demonstration feels expository rather than a renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit lacks felt cost. The final garden scene presents the lit lantern and a conversation that reiterates themes without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible. The subway traverse is narrated in summary ("she got off," "she walked now") rather than dramatized beats, flattening causality. Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and her present situation emerge slowly across the first 15% without anchoring concrete stakes early. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and midsummer setting frame the piece effectively, and the mica lantern is handled twice (carried, then lit). Spatial choreography across subway, park, and library garden remains coherent. However, setting details—wet stone, moss-covered sundial—function as atmosphere rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. The lantern's projection onto the sundial is vivid but ornamental, not a resource that changes the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to widen perspectives responsibly"—is declared but abstract, never narrowed by a concrete on-page test. The subway traverse unfolds as a travelogue without reversals; each scrawl is followed, not interpreted under pressure that forecloses options. The father's whispered line "I always saw the odds, never the stakes" arrives as epiphany without prior friction or a trade-off that makes the cost visible. No meaningful tightening or deepening alters Elara's available choices before the garden conversation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—probability versus compassion, theory versus emotion—is stated repeatedly in narration ("lucid contradictions," "certainty of theory and the uncertainty of love") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final image offers symbolic closure (lantern light, rain) but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The "clover melancholy" motif is asserted as tone rather than earned through specific contradictory choices. Elara's insight about the mica pane is told to her father, not dramatized through a scene that tests it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature—filtering setting through academic and emotional lenses—is consistent. However, diction drifts into abstract philosophizing ("lucid contradiction," "safe theory of probability versus the reckless act of the gamble") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. The father's single line of dialogue feels natural, but Elara's spoken explanation in the garden ("it shows how light bends through contradiction") is expository. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the lantern-lighting beat, then loosens for thematic summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "clover melancholy" is defined twice in adjacent sentences; "lucid contradiction" is explained in multiple adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the middle: "She walked now... Another message... She placed the lantern... She returned to the library." The final paragraph stacks thematic summaries ("a new probability... not a number, but a promise") that restate rather than advance. Figurative density in the closing ("bittersweet peace," "gentle and cleansing") blurs specificity. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the global 9+ disallowance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—daughter using chance to heal a gambler father—is familiar and executed without fresh synthesis. Cryptic subway scrawls guide Elara in a linear pilgrimage with no reversals or costs; the method could be swapped for tarot cards or fortune cookies without structural change. The lantern demonstration and garden reconciliation follow a predictable arc. "Lucid contradictions" and "clover melancholy" are named but not transformed into irreplaceable particulars. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She follows scrawls, lights the lantern, and explains her insight to her father—all pre-determined moves without friction or cost. Her role as "probability professor daughter" is mentioned but never leveraged to complicate a choice. She observes and reflects more than she acts under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern appears in three beats: given by the father (backstory), carried unlit, then lit to project patterns onto the sundial. It returns in the final scene, casting light onto the father's hands. However, its use is ornamental; the mica pane does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress. The projection onto the sundial is described, not integrated into a reversal or cost. It shapes the thematic conversation but does not drive a beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named five times across the story as a thematic label. It is explained in narration ("order of patterns born from flame's randomness") and dialogue ("how light bends through contradiction") but never dramatized as a stake or tactical constraint. The concept echoes as philosophy rather than shaping on-page options or choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is asserted in narration ("rejecting the cold calculus") but not embodied in a choice that trades off safety for risk. Elara's subway traverse is framed as rebellion, yet no authority or norm opposes her, and no cost accompanies her departure from the library. The trait is label-only, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Traverse structures the middle section: Elara moves from library to subway to park to river stop to garden. However, the traverse is narrated in summary rather than driving beats with causal linkage. The action could be replaced with a single contemplative walk without losing the thematic resolution. No turn traces directly to the act of traversing; it serves as connective tissue rather than engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The method—interpreting cryptic scrawls—appears in three beats (blue ink, "sum of all fears," "find where the numbers sleep," "remember the rain"). Each scrawl prompts a next move, but the interpretation is summary-told rather than shown under pressure. The mechanics are simple: read, ponder briefly, act. The method does not complicate or constrain; it guides without friction. Introduced early but does not shape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed library frames the opening and closing, with midsummer rain recurring. The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic symmetry but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The library garden is where the conversation occurs, yet any quiet outdoor space would serve. The rain's return is lyric but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" anchors the timeframe and is mentioned twice (opening, garden scene). It establishes the father's fragility and motivates Elara's concern, but it does not tighten a decision or create a deadline. The heart attack is backstory context rather than a live clock that narrows options or raises cost in the present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to widen perspectives responsibly" is declared in the opening paragraph and reflected in Elara's subway journey and final explanation to her father. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a choice where responsible widening conflicts with another want or fear. The motivation frames the narrative but does not force a trade-off with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is named three times and defined as "sweet, sad hope" and "bittersweet peace." The tone is coherent and modulates gently from contemplation to reconciliation. However, it remains a single static mood rather than intensifying or breaking under pressure. The final image echoes the tone without reweighting it; melancholy is asserted rather than charged through the closure beat.</comment>
