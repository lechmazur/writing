<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is given a職業 label ("contact tracer for hearts") but her interior life remains generic and her decisions feel automated rather than motivated by contradictory impulses. The piece tells us she is "persistently curious" and wants "to protect vulnerable voices," yet on the page she simply follows pulses without any visible cost, hesitation, or competing desire. Emotions are asserted through labels ("curiosity," "resolve," "compassion") rather than embodied through specific contradictory reactions under pressure. The final "smile" and walking away read as summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Elara listens, the voice becomes "whole," and she walks away—no decision narrows options, no renunciation forecloses a path, and no image reweights prior pressure with visible consequence. The work reads accumulative in texture but does not teach a pattern early or deliver a decisive deepening; instead it loops reassurances and pulses without escalation. Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what "contact tracer for hearts" means remains abstract past the first third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens (attempted Accumulative/Textural) does not cohere at closure because the final image ("walked away... ready for the next call") resets rather than reconfigures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The atrium, mist, and twilight are described vividly but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The hearing aid and locket are handled on the page, which lifts the score slightly, but neither object alters Elara's tactics or forces a spatial choice—she simply follows the pulses wherever they lead. The photograph is drawn out and gazed at, yet it does not pressure a decision or charge the final image with new weight. Because the Orientation Test penalty was applied in Q2, Q3 is capped at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to protect vulnerable voices"—is declared early but never tested by a competing pressure or cost. Elara encounters no obstacle, makes no sacrifice, and faces no escalation; the pulses grow clearer rather than more dangerous, and the voice is "restored" without her having to forfeit anything. The piece offers no meaningful tightening or reversal under any lens: coincidence (finding the locket) solves the puzzle, and the resolution is delivered to her rather than earned by her agency. No visible or felt price forecloses a path or alters her later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than dramatized: "incidental heroism," "quiet salvation," "curiosity into compassion" appear as direct labels in the narration, including in the final paragraph ("incidental heroism was her path"). The piece asserts meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from specific action and image. The photograph is described as "no longer a relic of death, but a testament to life," which is overt moralizing rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Because Q4 scored ≤6.9 (no escalation under the chosen lens), Q5 is capped at 7.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice is generically lyric and relies on stock poetic constructions: "mist-clad atrium," "reeling hush," "skeletal tree," "dawn of quiet heroism." Psychic distance is inconsistent—Elara's perceptual signature is not character-specific, and her diction ("assure," "bridge," "scribe") reads elevated and interchangeable rather than rooted in her interior lexicon. The hearing aid's voice speaks in complete declarative sentences ("I was silenced, but you have given me sound") without the fragmentation the narration earlier claimed. Because the Orientation Test penalty was applied in Q2, Q6 is capped at 7.8; heavy line debt in Q7 further caps Q6 at 7.6, but execution issues prevent approach of either ceiling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She had learned that heroism was often incidental" / "This was incidental heroism"; "assure" and "assured" appear five times in similar constructions; "persistently curious" is restated three times. Runs of identical sentence stems dominate the middle third: "She [verb]... She [verb]... The pulses [verb]... She [verb]." Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicle: "contact tracer for hearts," "guardian of echoes," "tracer of hearts." These artifacts touch the closure beats ("incidental heroism was her path"), triggering the artifact cap (−1.7) and disallowing 9+ globally. Filter-verb stacks ("she had learned," "she understood," "she knew") appear in four consecutive high-pressure lines, adding −0.5 and reinforcing the 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—supernatural investigation via old hearing aid—is functional but closely echoes detective-paranormal templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Contact tracer for hearts" and "incidental heroism" read as prompt labels rather than organic synthesis. The photograph, locket, and hearing aid are assembled rather than inevitably linked, and the resolution (voice becomes whole, Elara walks away) follows the expected arc without a fresh inflection. The piece hedges risk by making success frictionless and cost-free, occupying the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" is present throughout but functions as a職業 label rather than a choice-driver. Elara performs her role (tracking, listening, assuring) without a single decision that alters her tactics or forecloses an option. Her choices are automated by the pulses; removing this exact character type and substituting "ghost detective" or "medium" would require only minor edits. No key turn traces to her agency. Missing middle development and closure participation caps the score at 3.4; ornamental職業 use and swappability lower it further within that band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: described early (setup), drawn out and gazed at mid-story (development), and declared "safe" at the end (closure mention). However, its use is static—Elara looks at it but it does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning in the final image; it is "placed" with the locket in a summary line rather than charged with new pressure. Present across all three gates but purely ornamental in each, yielding eligibility near 6.0; decorative mentions and summary-only use at closure subtract ~−1.5, landing mid-4s. The element could be replaced with any keepsake without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named four times in the narration, including twice in the final paragraph, but never dramatized as a stake or tactic. The concept does not shape Elara's choices on the page—she follows the pulses without friction, and success is guaranteed rather than incidental. This is label-only theme assertion rather than integration; the story would function identically if the phrase were deleted. Missing middle development and closure participation (it appears only as commentary, not causal action) caps the score at 2.8; label-only use lowers it further within that band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is declared twice but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. Elara's investigation proceeds automatically via the pulses; no moment shows curiosity pulling her toward danger against caution or costing her time, safety, or another priority. The trait is present as a label (setup) but absent from middle choices and the ending, missing development and payoff gates and capping the score at 3.4. Label-only use and swappability (she could be "persistently dutiful" with identical beats) lower it slightly within that band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Assure" and its cognates appear six times, including in the final paragraph. However, the action is performed without cost or complication—Elara whispers reassurances and the voice becomes whole; no turn hinges on whether she can deliver this assurance or what she must forfeit to do so. The word is present across all three gates (early declaration, mid-story repetition, final summary) but is ornamental in each, yielding base eligibility ~6.0. Decorative use, no causal pressure, and extreme swappability (she could "witness," "honor," or "remember" with identical results) subtract ~−2.0, landing mid-3s. The action does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hearing aid appears early (setup), is adjusted and used to track pulses in the middle (development), and is described as "silent, its duty fulfilled" at the end (payoff). It shapes two beats by enabling the tracking, and its mechanics (dials, pulses) are shown on the page rather than merely summarized. However, the device does not impose a visible cost or constrain tactics—it works perfectly, and Elara never struggles with its limits or risks losing the signal. Present in all three gates and involved in two beats yields base ~7.0; lack of causal pressure or cost and moderate swappability (another detector could serve) subtract ~−1.8, landing upper-4s. The exact properties (decades-old, yellowed) do not matter to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The atrium, mist, and twilight are established early (setup), guide Elara's path through the middle (she moves deeper, mist thickens), and are referenced in the final paragraph (closure mention). The setting creates atmosphere and spatial progression but does not constrain a choice—Elara follows the pulses wherever they lead without the environment imposing cost or forcing a detour. Present in all three gates and involved in spatial choreography across two beats yields base ~6.5; lack of tactical pressure and swappability (another liminal space would function identically) subtract ~−0.9, landing mid-5s. The setting does not charge the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is stated early and repeated at the end, framing the timeframe, but the clock never tightens decisions. Elara has unlimited time to listen, follow pulses, and find the locket; no urgency or ticking deadline alters her tactics. The phrase appears in setup and closure mention but is absent from middle development, missing the development gate and capping the score at 3.4. Summary-only use and lack of temporal pressure lower it slightly within that band. The timeframe is ornamental rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is declared early (setup), shapes Elara's stated goal throughout (development via repeated assertion), and is echoed in the final paragraph (closure mention). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—no competing want or cost friction appears on the page; she protects the voice without sacrifice or hesitation. Present in all three gates via assertion but not dramatized through choice with visible cost yields base ~6.0; told-only execution and lack of friction subtract ~−1.5, landing low-4s. The motivation could be "to honor the forgotten" with identical beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the opening line and final third, and the tone of quiet, mist-shrouded stillness is sustained throughout. The mood is consistent and coherent but static—it does not modulate with pressure or shift at the ending to charge the final image. The tone is present early (setup) and at closure (mention) but does not develop or break in the middle, missing the development gate and capping base eligibility at ~6.0. Single static mood and lack of tonal escalation place it in the mid-5s within that band. The tone supports atmosphere but does not reweight the stake.</comment>
