<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation (to find deleted memories) is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. The fever backstory and pressed wildflowers arrive as exposition without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His "trembling hands" and the final "quiet wholeness" read as label-only emotional states; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The coffee-grounds ritual and chamber visit unfold without internal friction or visible cost that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land adequately by the beaching opening. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Arlo's understanding of where memories go—but the cost remains abstract ("weight of years lift") rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The causal lens weakens when the whale "chose the shore" and "brought these memories" without prior setup, reading as coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. The inferred lens (Causal/Accumulative hybrid) holds through the salt-crystal vision but the ending delivers thematic statement over on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The black sands, docks, shack, geothermal cave, and salt-crystal chamber are vividly named and sensorially detailed (the chamber's "soft, internal light," "geometric formations"). The cave constrains Arlo's approach ("treacherous… gravity pockets made his steps feel light or heavy") and the chamber's pedestal enables the flower-key action. However, much description remains postcard-level without filtering through Arlo's professional priorities as lantern-lighter; the whale's body and fluctuating gravity serve atmosphere more than they shape tactical choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding deleted memories—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live trade-off or narrowing choice occurs on the page. Arlo's chamber journey unfolds without opposition or cost: he places flowers, taps crystal, receives visions, exits whole. The gravity fluctuations and whale's "delivery" are external gifts rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The final "steadier flame" and calm sea grounds suggest resolution by environmental grace rather than agency with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—where lost things go, memory as recoverable artifact—emerges clearly through the salt-crystal conceit and whale delivery. Yet the ending offers an answer stated nearly as thesis: "they sink into the world's hidden layers, waiting to be unearthed." The pressed wildflowers recur purposefully (tin box → pedestal → new crystal) but the final image of "offerings of wildflowers pressed between pages of peace" tilts into overt symbolism. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the tidy recovery; the epiphany arrives without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows in "gleaming silence," "cold brine," "mineral tomb," but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("oceanic remembrance," "interred within a fresh crystal") that feels authorial rather than a dock-side lantern-lighter's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the vision, wider at harbor return). Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("He saw… He saw… He knew… He understood…") that flatten rhythm under pressure in the chamber climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary adequately and figurative language (gleaming silence, salt-dust whirlwind, mineral tomb) charges several images. However, paraphrase loops cluster: "The gleaming silence deepened, filled now with a presence…" directly after the gravity-stabilization line restates emotional resolution. The chamber sequence runs through template stems ("The mist coalesced… He saw… The beaching was… Arlo understood…") without syntactic variance. "Deleted memories" repeats as phrase across multiple beats without fresh specificity. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The salt-crystal memory chamber and whale-as-deliverer premise offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—man seeks lost past, finds it intact via mystical location—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The gravity pockets, coffee grounds, and geothermal cave serve as decorative genre signals rather than constraints that force hard choices. The final "calm sea" grounds and steady lantern flames resolve all tension symmetrically. No bold risk or specific synthesis that would break under substitution of similar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Arlo (dock-side lantern lighter) is present throughout and his occupation frames the opening and closing (lighting lamps). He seeks, travels, acts in the chamber (places flowers, taps crystal), and returns with altered purpose. However, his key decisions—following the coffee-grounds vision, tapping the crystal—are unopposed and cost-free; the role of lantern-lighter does not constrain or enable those choices. Present in closure (lighting lamps "with a new purpose") but the causal link is thematic rather than tactical. Setup, development, payoff gates met; lacks strong causal pressure or irreplaceability (another seeker role would serve equally). Mid-band: integral presence, moderate causal work, charges ending image weakly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: tin box backstory, pedestal key-action, final crystal interment and offerings. The pedestal placement triggers the crystal pulse (causal middle beat), and the final-line offerings close the arc with reweighted meaning (from brittle ghosts to active offerings). Setup, development, payoff gates all met; beat count: three. However, the flowers' unique properties (floral silhouette match) are told rather than shown constraining a harder choice; Arlo could have used any personal token. Closure linkage solid, causal pressure moderate, specificity limited. Strong lyric resonance but swappability concern lowers ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity (core concept) are introduced early (silt clouds, floating tools, ropes slack/taut), constrain Arlo's approach to the cave ("steps feel light or heavy at random"), and stabilize at closure ("pockets… stabilized, settling the salt"). Setup and development gates met; closure presence confirmed (stabilization signals resolution). Two distinct beats: approach and ending. However, the fluctuations do not force a tactical trade-off or visible cost; they complicate atmosphere but Arlo navigates them without adaptation. Causal pressure weak (ornamental complication). Mid-band: present across arc, modest constraint, charges ending but does not drive choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fluctuates mysteriously (attribute of gravity pockets): the mystery is stated ("mysteriously") and fishermen whisper of unpredictable behavior. The fluctuation makes Arlo's path "treacherous" (enables tension) and later "stabilized" (closure marker). Setup and closure gates met; middle beat borderline (the cave traverse mentions randomness but no on-page adaptation). The attribute itself—mystery—does not impose a cost or enable a unique tactic; it decorates the gravity pockets' presence. Label-only trait; no visible trade-off. Low-mid band: functional support, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Exhume (action): Arlo "knew he had to exhume the memory he sought, to dig it from this mineral tomb," then taps the crystal to shatter it and release the memory-mist. The action is signaled metaphorically, executed literally, and produces the climactic vision. Setup (the verb appears just before execution), development (the tap), and payoff (visions coalesce) all present. Two beats: intent declaration and execution. The action drives the chamber's central turn and cannot be swapped without loss (other verbs—"unlock," "retrieve"—would soften the burial/tomb motif). Strong causal role, thematic integration, closure linkage solid. Caps at upper-mid band: essential to chamber beat, somewhat replaceable by synonym, cost generic (no visible price paid for exhuming).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Patterns in coffee grounds (method): taught by grandmother, used each morning, shows "chaotic knots" then "a distinct image: a chamber of growing salt crystals" that guides Arlo beyond docks. Setup (morning ritual), development (the vision image), closure presence indirect (calm sea pattern next morning). Three beats. The method enables the quest's direction; without it, Arlo has no map. Causal pressure moderate (the vision is given, not earned through struggle). Specificity solid (coffee grounds vs. other divination). Swappability concern (tea leaves, dream, rumor could substitute with minor edits). Mid-band: essential enabling beat, moderate irreplaceability, closure participation weak (the calm-sea reading is thematic coda, not causal).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Salt crystal growing chamber (setting): the climactic location where Arlo places flowers, taps crystal, receives visions, and understands the whale's gift. Setup (coffee-grounds image of "chamber of growing salt crystals"), development (entire chamber sequence with pedestal, floating crystals, gravity pockets), payoff (new memories crystallizing there, Arlo's return visits). Three+ beats. The chamber's mechanics—pedestal, crystal-pulse, gravity-dance—drive the central turn and supply the thematic literalization (memories crystallize). Environment constrains action (he must "tap the crystal" there) and the final image of "new memories began to crystallize" charges closure. Strong causal pressure, high specificity, irreplaceable (no other setting matches the crystal-memory conceit). Edges into high band: indispensable to structure and theme, present in closure, cost connection indirect (the chamber itself imposes no price).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>After the whale beaches (timeframe): the opening anchor and the story's inciting frame. The beaching creates the "gleaming silence" and precedes all action; the whale's body is "gone, taken by the tide" at closure. Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent (time does not tighten tactics). The "after" frame is static backdrop; days pass ("One day," "the next morning") without clock pressure or deadline. Swappable (another mysterious ocean event could serve). Functional setup, no escalation role, weak closure tie (the whale's departure is told, not dramatized as loss). Low-mid band: necessary framing device, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To find where deleted memories go (motivation): stated explicitly ("His motivation was simple yet profound"), drives the coffee-grounds search, the cave journey, the chamber revelation ("Arlo understood… where deleted memories go"). Setup (fever-stolen past, tin-box flowers), development (quest and vision), payoff (answer delivered and enacted). Three beats. The motivation frames all choices but is never dramatized as conflicted; no scene shows Arlo weighing this goal against another want or fear. Told-only interiority; no friction between cost and desire on the page. Mid-band: motivates structure, charges closure thematically, lacks embodied choice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gleaming silence (tone): introduced in opening ("gleaming silence fell," "immense, luminous quiet"), recurs through "silence seep into his bones," "emptiness in the air," "silence retained its gleam" at closure. Setup, development (chamber hum, "mist… silent cinema," "silence deepened"), and payoff all present. The tone charges the final image ("silence retained its gleam") and modulates under pressure (silence absorbs lamplight, hums in chamber, deepens with presence). Three+ beats. Coherent and distinct, supports the memory-recovery theme (lost things are silent but luminous). However, the tone is static mood rather than dynamic force; it does not constrain a choice. Upper-mid band: purposeful throughout, charges closure, moderate causal role.</comment>
