<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to trace honest origins is stated clearly, but her choices feel more like methodical observation than pressured decision. The "tranquilly perceptive" attribute remains label-only; we're told she cultivates stillness but never see a moment where this trait constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The shift from seeking "one origin" to "multiple contributors" occurs through reflection rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives. Interior experience is abstract ("her mind operated like a catalog") rather than embodied and contradictory under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (Elara, forgotten library in sunken city, during blackout) within the opening moves. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through stamp discoveries, and the final insight reweights the manuscript's nature. However, the closure insight—"origins are not points but processes"—is delivered as abstracted reflection rather than a concrete image or action that makes the cost undeniable on the page. The "dappled resolve" moment and candle-blowing feel like gestures toward closure rather than a decisive reconfiguration with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is vivid (water-damaged shelves, vaulted ceiling, cryptic texts) and the blackout constrains her tools, forcing reliance on candlelight and the physical stamp. The antique ink stamp as micro-setting object does charge the methodology and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through scholarly priorities. The setting does not, however, constrain a pivotal choice—Elara's path would proceed similarly with or without the specific environmental pressures beyond the blackout itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—validating the manuscript's lineage—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the stamp-matching process, but escalation reads as intellectual discovery rather than a tightening that narrows options or imposes trade-offs. The blackout intensifies concentration but does not force a renunciation or difficult choice. The ending reframes the task (communal artifact vs. single origin) yet lacks an on-page price; Elara "continues her work" without visible loss or foreclosed path, reducing the felt cost required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme—integrity in historical record-keeping, collective versus solitary authorship—emerges from the stamp investigation rather than overt statement. The final reflection ("origins are not points but processes, stamped again and again with honest intent") borders on thematic summary, reducing resonance. The piece invites reflection on scholarly method and communal truth, but the ending candle-blow and readiness to "share her discovery" feel like a tidy resolution rather than a non-literal, resonant answer. Reclaimed stillness and dappled resolve function more as mood labels than thematic engines that constrain choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness"), though some phrases verge on abstraction ("her perception sharpened by tranquillity"). The narrative voice has a measured, scholarly texture that fits the indexer role. However, under peak discovery moments the prose does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect stress; the same calm register persists whether she's lighting a candle or experiencing a revelation, flattening the sense of pressure modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "reclaimed stillness" is defined twice in adjacent paragraphs (once as "not merely absence of sound" then again as "purposeful quiet"), and "alternative hypothesis" recurs with synonym churn ("new way," "slowly took shape," "formulated an alternative hypothesis"). Template cadence is visible in the repeated "Her [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") stack in the final third without voice-motivated purpose. These artifacts dull momentum and disqualify 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—scholar validates ancient manuscript during a blackout in a sunken library—combines familiar elements (isolated research quest, lost civilization, power failure) without a non-obvious synthesis. The "communal artifact" insight is intellectually interesting but predictable within archival-mystery conventions. The tranquil, methodical tone avoids risk; Elara's emotional arc is steady rather than contradictory or surprising. Removing the sunken-city framing and replacing it with a standard archive would leave the core discovery arc intact, signaling insufficient transformation of the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara as "logical page indexer" appears throughout and her scholarly method drives the investigation. However, her role is primarily observational; the key "turns" (realizing multiple stamps, formulating the communal-artifact hypothesis) occur through reflection rather than pressured choices that alter tactics with cost. She is present in all beats but does not make a decision that forecloses a path or redefines options. Present and functional, but replaceable with another scholar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp is handled in multiple beats: initial encounter, pressing it onto blank page, comparing to marks in the Annals, identifying variations in other stamps, and stamping her own verification marks. It is causally active (enables the matching methodology) and returns at closure when she adds her mark to the chain. The stamp's glyph (wave encircling quill) is described but its unique properties beyond "authenticates documents" do not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions as a well-integrated tool but not an indispensable one whose removal would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is named early and recurs in the final paragraph, bookending the piece. It is described as a "purposeful quiet she had cultivated" and later "felt active, filled with the ghostly presence of those past indexers." However, it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; it remains a thematic label and atmospheric quality rather than a concept that changes Elara's options or imposes cost. Functional as mood, but swappable with "focused calm" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is introduced in the opening and reappears as "her perception sharpened by tranquillity" near the end. It is described ("her mind operated like a catalog") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. We do not see a moment where being tranquil forces a tradeoff or where heightened perception leads to a specific discovery that another trait would miss. Label-only trait, ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears three times: her digital index is useless, forcing her to "readjust her approach entirely"; she readjusts her mental model of the collection; she readjusts the candle to illuminate a broader shelf. The action signals adaptability and recurs across beats, but the major turn (realizing the Annals are a compilation) traces to stamp comparison rather than a specific readjustment decision. The final candle readjustment is a physical gesture that does not redefine options. Present in one key beat (approach shift) and closure setup (broader illumination), but easily swappable with "reconsider" or "refocus."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled early ("She would need an alternative hypothesis") and developed in the middle third ("The alternative hypothesis slowly took shape," "she formulated an alternative hypothesis that challenged the solitary genius narrative"). It shapes her attempts by reframing the task from finding one origin to tracing multiple fragments. However, the hypothesis itself is abstract scholarly method rather than a concrete mechanism with unique properties; "new theory" or "revised model" would serve equally well. Present across beats and integral to the discovery, but replaceable without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "forgotten library inside a sunken city" is established early (water-damaged shelves, vaulted ceiling, submerged for centuries) and the blackout removes digital tools, forcing reliance on candlelight and physical stamps. The setting supplies atmospheric detail and one constraint (no power). However, the underwater/sunken aspect does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect the outcome; the same investigation could occur in a standard archive during a blackout. The labyrinth and cryptic texts are mentioned but not navigated with cost. Functional setting with one causal constraint, but the "sunken city" layer is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced in the opening line and recurs ("the blackout would end," "in the timeless blackout, she felt no rush"). It removes her digital index, intensifies concentration by stripping distractions, and creates the candlelight constraint. However, time is not tracked with urgency; "hours passed" without consequence, and there is no ticking clock that alters tactics. The blackout enables the reflective mode but does not tighten decisions. Present in setup and closure participation (she works until the candle gutters), but time pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is named early as her reason for coming to the library and recurs throughout (seeking "true provenance," tracing "honest origins of each fragment," "trace honest origins had evolved from mere scholarship to a personal quest for integrity"). It drives the investigation and deepens by the end into a quest for "integrity in history." However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page; no friction between wants and costs, no moment where tracing honesty forces her to sacrifice speed, comfort, or another goal. Told and developed thematically, but not dramatized through choice-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears twice: candle casting "dappled shadows" mirrors her "dappled resolve—flickering yet persistent," and later "her resolve, dappled with moments of uncertainty but rooted in logical deduction." The metaphor is purposeful and coherent, linking visual imagery to emotional state. However, tone does not modulate with pressure; the calm, measured register persists whether she's lighting a candle or experiencing revelation. The final "with dappled resolve, she blew out the candle" charges the closing gesture, but the static mood across beats trends mid-band. Lyric reprise present but tone control under pressure is minimal.</comment>
