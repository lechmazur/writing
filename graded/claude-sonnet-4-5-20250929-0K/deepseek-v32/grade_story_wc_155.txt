<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory impulses or a genuine on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions—placing the fragment, adjusting prisms, moving through ruins—are unimpeded ritual rather than decisions under pressure. The final "renewed spirit" and "permanent change" are asserted without any earned transformation or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("pensive mirth," "lost joy") rather than specific, embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure with visible cost. The story declares Elara has "rediscovered lost joy" and experienced "permanent change," but these are told outcomes, not dramatized reversals. The sunlight breaking through and the tree of light are cosmetic events that do not narrow options or exact a felt price. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—the ending delivers assertion rather than a legible before/after with cost. Orientation is adequate (−0 on that test), but the absence of a true closure unit caps the category severely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and thick fog are established early and recur throughout, meeting the setup gate. Sensory detail is present but generic ("mossy stone," "crumbling arch," "broken walls") and filtered through catalog description rather than character-specific perception. The fog becomes a canvas and the fresco fragment is handled, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics—they are scenic furniture. No environmental detail charges the final image with cost or reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"rediscover lost joy"—is declared but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara's light-painting proceeds without obstacle, opposition, or trade-off; she adjusts her prism, projects images, and succeeds effortlessly. The sunlight breaking through is coincidental, not earned by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid, no path foreclosed, and escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory and impermanence is stated explicitly rather than arising from concrete particulars: "joy was not lost but stored in memories and art" is thesis declaration. The fresco fragment recurs but does not shift meaning through action—it remains a static symbol. "Pensive mirth" and "exposed film" are invoked as motifs without constraint or charged reprise. The ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer; it summarizes the thesis in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is minimal; diction remains generic and does not reflect a mural artist's particular way of seeing ("thick fog," "vivid again"). The prose recycles phrase stems: "She painted with light" appears three times, "knowledge network" seven times, "pensive mirth" five times, creating a template cadence. Filter verbs ("She realized," "She felt," "She knew") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "rediscover lost joy" (goal) is restated five times; "knowledge network" appears seven times with minimal variation; "pensive mirth" recurs five times; "exposed film" is invoked four times as metaphor without development. Template cadence dominates: runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" sentence openers across 15+ consecutive lines. Stock constructions ("within the fold of a daydream" used three times) and abstract phrasing ("a permanent change," "stored in memories") replace concrete action. High-density figurative language ("pulse," "bloom," "fold," "glow") in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her motivation fulfilled"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—artist revisits ruined district to reconnect with lost inspiration—is a familiar template executed without transformation. "Pensive mirth," "painting with light," and "exposed film" are invoked as labels but not integrated into specific, non-obvious choices that surprise in hindsight. The conflict-free arc (no opposition, no trade-off, declarative success) and the explain-everything ending ("joy was not lost but stored") avoid risk. No fresh inflection; the final image (tree of light growing from fragment) is predictable allegorical closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key choice with visible cost. She wanders, places the fragment, adjusts tools, and imagines—observational and ritual actions. The "decision" to create light murals is declared, not dramatized as a turn under pressure. She is the vehicle for thematic assertion, not an agent whose choices redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is introduced early (setup), handled in multiple beats (placed on stone, guides composition, glows in sunlight), and appears in the final image (tree of light growing from it). However, it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a functional prop. The glow in the final beat is cosmetic, not causal. Two gates met (setup, payoff); mid-beat use is descriptive, not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Exposed film" is invoked four times as metaphor and thematic echo ("like exposed film," "concept she explored," "made her think of capturing," "exposed film of her mind") but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It remains a label for the theme rather than a mechanic that changes options. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is declared as her attribute, described in method (lenses, prisms, lanterns), and enacted in her projections. However, no on-page cost or constraint is tied to this trait—she succeeds effortlessly without trade-off or limitation. The trait enables action but does not force a visible price or tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Display" frames her actions throughout (she displays murals, scenes, images, the final tree of light) and is present in the ending. However, every display succeeds without obstacle; the action is ritual rather than decisive. The climax (displaying the tree of light) is cosmetic rather than causal—no turn or cost hinges on this exact action. Functional but replaceable with "create" or "project."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Knowledge network" is named seven times and described as journals, oral histories, and connections to other artists. It provides background detail (types of apples, quilt patterns) but does not constrain or enable a key choice. It is informational scaffolding, not a mechanic that shapes attempts or alters tactics. Summary-only and late in causal relevance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and thick fog are established early, recur throughout, and frame the closure (fog lifts slightly, sunlight breaks through). Spatial choreography is clear (crumbling arch, broken walls). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is scenic canvas. The fog's slight lift at the end is coincidental atmosphere, not a causal constraint or charged reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is invoked three times as framing phrase, but time remains vague and untracked. No live clock tightens decisions; the daydream "ends" without on-page consequence or temporal cost. The phrase is ornamental mood-setting rather than a mechanic that alters tactics or forecloses options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is declared as motivation in the opening and reasserted throughout ("her motivation fulfilled"). However, joy is never dramatized as a conflicted choice with friction between wants and costs. The motivation is told and resolved by assertion ("she found lost joy") rather than enacted through on-page pressure and visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named five times and described once ("mourning the loss but celebrating the memory," "bittersweet acknowledgment"). The tone is declared rather than modulated through syntax or rhythm under pressure. It remains a static label that does not shift with escalation or charge the final image—ornamental mood rather than a tonal arc that reweights the stake.</comment>
