<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's interiority is consistently analytic but relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("physics of letting go") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The captain's note and Earhart parallel provide external motivation, but Leo's own stakes remain cerebral throughout—no genuine internal conflict dramatized in scene. The final "learned to let go of the need to understand everything" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is filtered through "sophisticated melancholy" as a label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (deep-sea explorer, sunken library). The piece accumulates discoveries—log, note, snow globe—that Leo synthesizes into understanding, landing a Conceptual Repricing at closure when he writes his journal note and surfaces with new insight. However, the cost at closure is stated ("heart heavy... but light with release") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or tangible trade-off. The accumulative lens holds, but the final reweighting lacks an on-page action or visible price that makes the before/after undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly rendered with concrete detail (leather-bound volumes drifting "like sleepy fish," carved oak desk, snow globe). Spatial choreography is clear: submersible glides through water, enters through hull gash, Leo moves to desk and log. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when Leo secures it for return, constraining his choice to surface with closure in mind. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered through Leo's analytic attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is conceptual rather than tactical: Leo reads, observes, synthesizes, but faces no obstacle or reversal that forces a difficult choice. The discoveries deepen his understanding but do not narrow his options or impose a trade-off. The captain's note and Earhart parallel provide thematic pressure, yet Leo's agency at closure is to document and ascend, acts that feel inevitable rather than earned through a moment where holding on conflicted with release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the captain's equation, Earhart's transmission, and the snow globe as objects that embody release and letting go. The final journal line ("The equation is complete when we stop solving for holding on") lands as a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece edges toward thematic over-articulation: "sophisticated melancholy," "physics of letting go," and "transmission of meaning beyond the self" are stated more than discovered. The ending reweights prior material but borders on summarizing the lesson rather than letting image alone carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with Leo's analytic voice maintained throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: he "untangles threads," notes weight in his glove, documents methodically. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sophisticated melancholy," "transmission of meaning beyond the self") that feels essayistic rather than grounded in Leo's immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks rhythmic variation or embodied texture in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and thematic restatements permeate the text: "physics of letting go" appears six times, "untangling threads" four times, "last transmission" three times with minimal variation. Template cadence is evident in repeated "He [verb]" and "Leo [verb]" sentence openings across adjacent paragraphs. Key phrases ("quietly analytic," "sophisticated melancholy," "first-name basis with death") recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The final three paragraphs especially loop thematic claims without advancing image or action. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sunken library premise offers a fresh angle, and linking the captain's farewell to Earhart's last transmission is a thoughtful synthesis. However, the core emotional arc—explorer seeks understanding of letting go, finds it in artifacts, surfaces with clarity—follows a familiar template of discovery-as-epiphany without a non-obvious inflection. The snow globe as gift and the buoyancy equation next to a bird sketch are specific, but the resolution into philosophical acceptance feels median-safe rather than risky. Transformation is partial: swap the library for another meditative setting and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leo is present throughout and his analytic nature drives his method, but his choices are observational and documentarian rather than decisional. He picks up the snow globe, reads the log, decides to return the globe—none of these turns the plot or imposes a visible cost. The attribute shapes his voice but does not create a key reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears early (carved desk beat), is examined and set aside, then reappears at closure when Leo places it in a protective case for return. Its meaning is reweighted from captain's gift to closure object. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Leo's decision to return it is humane but does not foreclose another path. Two beats, closure presence, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The last transmission from the captain is discovered mid-story, echoed via Earhart's parallel, and explicitly linked to Leo's insight at closure ("last transmission was a key"). It shapes Leo's synthesis and appears in his final reflections, driving the thematic turn. Present in setup (via Earhart frame), development (captain's log), and payoff (Leo's journal note). Strong thematic integration but not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is stated three times and shapes Leo's method (documenting, synthesizing), but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It enables his approach but never forces a trade-off or mistake. The trait is consistent but functions as a label more than a dramatized liability or advantage under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo writes a note in his journal at closure, mirroring the captain's note discovered earlier. This act of documentation completes his thematic arc and signals his synthesis. However, the note-writing is additive rather than a turn that redefines options; removing it would soften but not break the closure. Present in setup (captain's note), middle (Leo documents), payoff (journal entry), but causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" is mentioned five times and described as Leo's method throughout. He applies it to the debris, the captain's note, and Earhart's transmission. It shapes his approach in every beat, though its mechanics are more metaphorical than procedural. Present early, sustained, and referenced at closure, but the method does not impose a constraint or force a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten sunken ship library is the entire stage: Leo enters it, explores its artifacts, and the setting supplies the captain's log, note, and snow globe that drive his synthesis. It appears in the opening frame, throughout the middle exploration, and is named again at closure as he ascends. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and thematic charge; no other location could provide these specific artifacts and pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Earhart discovery is mentioned in the opening sentence to frame global fascination and reappears thematically when Leo links her last transmission to the captain's. However, it does not tighten Leo's timeline or create urgency. It functions as a thematic parallel rather than a temporal constraint. Present in setup and thematic payoff, but does not alter tactics or pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leo's desire to understand the physics of letting go is stated early, sustained through his exploration, and resolved at closure when he writes that the equation is complete. The motivation drives every beat and his final insight. However, it is told more than dramatized in friction: Leo never faces a moment where holding on conflicts with release in a way that costs him something tangible on the page. Present, coherent, but the want-versus-cost friction is conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sophisticated melancholy is named twice and pervades the prose through reflective phrasing and the elegiac treatment of artifacts and loss. The tone is stable and coherent, modulating slightly as Leo moves from discovery to synthesis. It charges the final image of surfacing with "heart heavy... but light with release." However, the label is stated rather than evoked purely through cadence and image, and the tone does not shift under pressure—it remains consistently wistful throughout.</comment>
