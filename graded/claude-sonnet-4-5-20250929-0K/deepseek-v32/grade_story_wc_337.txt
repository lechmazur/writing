<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to free spirits is stated but never tested by competing wants or genuine cost. Her "lucid unrest" is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The work proceeds smoothly without mistakes, friction, or meaningful internal conflict; she never hesitates, doubts her method, or faces a choice that would reveal her hierarchy of values. The captain's knot poses no greater personal challenge than the earlier ones.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: silence accumulates, knots unravel in sequence, spirits release. However, closure lacks visible cost; the final knot gives way without forfeit, and Elara's "contentment" at the end erases her earlier unrest with no on-page price paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending delivers completion without a legible before/after that reconfigures meaning or forecloses a path. "Across sharing a secret" as timeframe is vague and undermotivated—secrets are whispered but never dramatized as tactical choices or constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary refracts starlight into colors that guide her hands, a functional micro-setting detail that affects her work. Spatial choreography is coherent (net, needle, sanctuary space). The setting supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a meaningful choice or charge the final image beyond backdrop. The net itself—though an object—functions as a spatial anchor and returns at closure, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped spirits—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through reversals. Each knot unravels successfully; the captain's knot is declared "most turbulent" yet yields immediately after a single line of dialogue. No on-page cost narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The accumulative design requires at least one meaningful intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the work remains steady and uncomplicated from first knot to last.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of rest/release/accumulated silence emerges through image and repetition, not overt statement—a strength. However, the ending offers symmetric satisfaction: spirits freed, sanctuary glowing, Elara content, with no counter-pressure or ambiguity. The final image does not reweight prior material or pose a resonant question; it declares completion. "Interlaced hush" recurs but as decorative motif rather than a constraining force that complicates the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and legible. Diction is elevated and consistent, though it flirts with the poetic-template cadence ("accumulated silence," "interlaced hush," "lucid unrest") across multiple sentences without variation. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("I know you hold the echoes of the drowned," "Your crew is at peace") but carries little subtext or resistance. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "watched") appear frequently but remain within voice; under peak stress the register does not shift inappropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "accumulated silence" / "accumulating silence," "interlaced hush" / "fabric of quiet," "exhume" / "exhumed" / "exhuming" cycle across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence: "She [verb]," "Elara [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]" runs dominate sentence openings (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("blanket over the world, dense and warm") and scaffold sentences ("This accumulated silence pressed softly") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate the same content (unraveling frees spirits) without advancing knowledge or options. Clarity is high, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—restoring broken masks by unraveling a spirit-trapping fisherman's net—combines familiar ghost-release and craft-magic tropes without a fresh angle. The emotional arc (unrest → contentment) and plot structure (methodical task → completion) are template-standard. The prism sanctuary and refracted starlight offer vivid images, but these function as backdrop rather than transforming the core material. No turn or final reconfiguration feels non-obvious or earned in hindsight through specific character choice or world logic that could not be swapped for a generic equivalent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the central action, but her choices do not create key turns. She begins unraveling and continues until done; no beat dramatizes a decision that alters her approach or tactics. The "secret" sharing (3 instances) is told-only and does not visibly constrain or enable her next move. She observes and executes without friction, so the character's agency does not drive escalation or closure—logically consistent but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle is introduced early (setup ✓), used explicitly in two beats (inserting into first knot, poised at captain's knot; development ✓), and set down at closure (payoff ✓). However, its specific properties (fineness for delicate work) do not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure. Any fine tool could substitute with minor edits. It is handled on the page but remains functionally generic, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" appears repeatedly as atmospheric description ("weave of quiet," "fabric of quiet," "vibrated with gentle energy") but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It is a thematic label without causal work. The silence accumulates—but does not narrow Elara's options, complicate her task, or reweight the final image with cost. Present and consistent, yet ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is foregrounded early and recurs ("accumulated silence pressed softly," "accumulating silence," "accumulated silence reached a peak"). The trait describes the sanctuary's atmosphere but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The silence gathers released spirits passively; Elara does not adapt her method or pay a price because of the accumulation. Functional atmosphere, no causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Exhume" is signaled early ("exhume souls"), reappears at mid-work ("exhuming here meant revealing souls"), and frames the closure ("spirits were exhumed and settled"). The action drives multiple beats—each knot unraveled is an exhumation. However, the term itself is metaphorical and the work could be re-labeled "release" or "free" without structural loss. The action is present and causal but not irreplaceable, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the opening ("unraveling knots in that ancient net"), used across at least three beats (first knot, middle knots, captain's knot), and defines the mechanics on the page. The net's fibers and knots are handled concretely, and each unraveling produces a spirit's sigh. The method shapes her attempts and the sequence of the task. However, the specific centuries-old fisherman origin does not constrain her approach; any knotted net would serve equally. Strong integration across beats but mid-high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is anchored early (setup ✓) and returns in the final paragraph (payoff ✓). The refracted starlight guides her hands in one beat (development ✓), a functional detail. However, the sanctuary as a location does not pressure her choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she could perform the same task in any quiet space. The starlight's guidance is asserted but not dramatized as a turning point. Postcard atmosphere with one mid-scene functional beat, capping the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" as timeframe is unclear and poorly integrated. Secrets are shared three times but not tied to a ticking clock or deadline that tightens her decisions. The night passes but time is untracked and does not alter her tactics. The phrase "across" suggests a span, yet no urgency or time constraint shapes the work. The element is mentioned but does not function as a timeframe that pressures the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is stated early and recurs ("ground those fears," "ground them in the sanctuary," "grounded the spirits"). The motivation explains why she is present and frames the task. However, it is never conflicted or tested—she never hesitates, doubts, or faces a competing want that would force a trade-off. The motivation is told-only rather than dramatized through friction between desire and cost, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is labeled early ("Elara felt a lucid unrest") and bookended at closure ("lucid unrest fade into contentment"). The tone is asserted but not embodied through syntax or rhythm that shifts under pressure. The prose remains steady and elevated throughout; no modulation or cadence break charges the final image. The tone is coherent but static, a single note rather than a dynamic element that intensifies or reweights the ending.</comment>
