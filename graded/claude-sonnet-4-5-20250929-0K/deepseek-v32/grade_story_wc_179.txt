<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's scheming pacifist identity is asserted through label and summarized method ("meticulously arrange the world") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Kael's resentment is described via external metaphor ("knot," "shifting grace") but his internal experience remains abstract; the tear and exhale at closure feel unearned because no micro-choices showed him wrestling with competing desires. The pin-warming and "cellular memory" function as metaphysical plot devices rather than embodied emotional progression, and the final understanding ("He understood") tells the turn instead of showing it through a concrete choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "the heart of the crumbling city" and "Soundless Sanctuary" arrive early, but who Kael is and why he is present remain vague past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—pin fusing, resentment "released to become part of a larger composition"—relies on metaphysical convenience (the pin reappears and heals itself) rather than causal escalation or Kael's agency; no on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (reality-shift layering), but the ending asserts transformation via summary ("he understood") instead of a final image that reweights prior material, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary's magical nullification and the shifting-grace visual effects (starfield, verdant grove, molten core) are vivid but function as spectacle rather than constraint; none of the environmental shifts force Kael to alter tactics or choices. The music box and pin receive tactile attention (warm palm, vibration up arm) and the pin's physical state does charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting exception for object-as-setting. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the reality flux, and the golden luminescence at closure ties environment to emotional state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stabilizing Kael's reality before the instability becomes permanent—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates through Kael's agency or a live trade-off. Elara's "scheming" consists of verbal instruction ("Focus on the silence," "Let it move") without on-page friction or cost; Kael's confession and tear are narrated outcomes rather than dramatized reversals that narrow options. The pin's reappearance and self-repair resolve the problem via metaphysical convenience rather than protagonist choice, and no visible price is paid—Elara's "pacifist's heart racing" is a label, not a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—resentment as a broken mechanism that can be released into a larger composition—is stated overtly in Elara's dialogue ("Resentment is a broken pin in your own mechanism") and the narrator's final summary, replacing scene pressure with thesis. The music-box metaphor recurs (broken → whole) but functions as symbolic illustration rather than arising from concrete, contradictory particulars; "cellular memory" and "the grace is in the shift" are prompt-like abstractions. The ending offers a conceptual answer (transformation through acceptance) but the answer is told ("He understood") rather than dramatized through a resonant image that reweights prior material without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third over Elara, but distance control slips when the narration accesses Kael's interiority without cue ("his bitterness a palpable pressure," "He understood"). Elara's mental-projection dialogue ("Focus on the silence") is clean and voice-consistent, but the prose leans on elevated register ("meticulously arrange," "primal harmony," "marrow") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is generic (visual metaphors dominate; other senses appear tokenistically) and syntactic variety is present but rhythm does not modulate under peak pressure—the climactic paragraph maintains the same rolling, clause-heavy cadence as the opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "the break is what holds the song" / "the shape of the whole song is still there"; "scheming pacifist" / "her scheme a success"; "hollow" / "imprisonment" / "released." Template cadence appears in the climax ("A tear traced… the wild fluctuations slowed… The pin… gleamed… He understood"—four consecutive subject-verb stems). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicles ("knot," "poison," "composition"), and elevated diction ("disquieting waves," "palpable pressure," "symptom of the shifting grace") drifts outside the POV's embodied register in peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—magical reality instability + therapy metaphor (broken mechanism → release) + heirloom object—follows a recognizable template (mentor guides wounded person to self-repair via symbolic artifact) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "cellular memory" and "shifting grace" labels are coined terms that function as magic-system conveniences rather than irreducible particulars; swapping them for "soul echo" or "reality fracture" would not alter the emotional arc. The ending's golden luminescence and "simple, pure notes" resolve into tidy symbolic satisfaction without risk or ambiguity, choosing the safety middle that evades bold stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and labeled "scheming pacifist" in the opening, but her decisions (placing pin, guiding focus, inserting cylinder) are executed without friction or on-page cost; her "most delicate manipulation" is asserted, not dramatized through a choice that narrows her own options. She observes and instructs but does not face a trade-off that alters tactics. The "scheming" trait appears in setup and thematic summary but does not constrain a middle beat or charge the closure—Kael's transformation proceeds without Elara paying a visible price or confronting a pacifist dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pin is handled in three beats: placed in Kael's palm (first third), grows warm and transmits vibration (middle), gleamed whole at closure. Its broken state → fused state mirrors Kael's arc and the object's reappearance/repair drives the symbolic resolution. However, the pin's mechanics (why it reappears, how it fuses) rely on metaphysical convenience ("a symptom of the shifting grace aligning with intent") rather than Kael's causal choice, weakening irreplaceability. It shapes two beats and charges the final image but does not constrain a middle choice with cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shifting grace"—reality turning fluid and subjective—is introduced early (opening paragraph) and recurs in five beats: prismatic haze, table rippling, walls dissolving/solidifying, room cycling, fluctuations slowing to golden luminescence. It provides visual texture and mirrors Kael's emotional state, but it does not constrain choices or alter tactics; characters move through the shifts without adapting action. The concept frames the dominant stake (stabilize reality) and participates in closure (golden light), satisfying two gates, but its mechanics remain decorative rather than causal, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The pin "reappears when needed" is mentioned in the second paragraph and shown once (lying on desk before Elara places it in Kael's hand). The trait enables the plot but imposes no cost or constraint—Elara does not trade anything to access it, and its convenience (appearing "as if it had always been there") functions as magic-system fiat. The attribute is swappable (any minor enchantment or Elara's foresight could substitute) and does not shape a middle choice or charge the ending beyond setup service.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Convince" is the stated mission (Elara "aimed to convince not through logic") and recurs in thematic summary ("her scheme a success; she had convinced a wounded reality"), but the action is executed via instruction and metaphysical artifact rather than dramatized persuasion with friction. Elara projects commands, Kael confesses and channels feeling into the pin, and transformation occurs—no moment shows Kael resisting and Elara adapting her approach with visible cost. The action frames setup and closure but does not drive a middle reversal, and it is swappable with "heal" or "guide" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Cellular memory"—the body recalling peace in its fibers—is introduced in the second paragraph and repeated in Elara's dialogue ("the cellular memory of the unbroken song") and final summary. It functions as thematic label rather than mechanics that shape attempts; no on-page beat shows how Kael accesses or struggles with this memory, and the method does not constrain choices. The vibration "unlocking in his marrow" is sensory description, not a dramatized process with cost. The method appears in setup and closure summary but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary (magical noise nullification, vaulted library) is anchored early and present in every beat. The silence enables Elara's mental projection and the final sound-in-silence contrast charges the ending image (crystalline notes → perfect quiet). However, the setting does not constrain choices—characters never adapt tactics because of the silence, and the spatial layout (shelves, table, music box) remains static backdrop. The setting frames and charges closure but does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters middle action, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is present throughout: cracks spiderweb, walls dissolve, room cycles through echoes (grove, archive, molten core), fluctuations slow. The timeframe is continuous (one scene) and the shifts provide visual pressure that mirrors Kael's emotional state, but they do not tighten decisions or force time-sensitive choices—Elara and Kael proceed at their own pace without urgency imposed by the shifts. The temporal element participates in setup, middle texture, and closure (stabilization) but does not function as a live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to teach resentment to release" is declared in the opening (her project to prevent permanent instability) and restated in the final summary, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She observes, instructs, and succeeds without friction—no moment shows her fearing failure, sacrificing another value, or choosing between competing goods. The desire frames the dominant stake and appears in closure summary but remains told-only, not shown through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with price paid on the page.</comment>
