<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and sustained, but his interiority remains abstract—"subdued awakenings" and "mechanically warm glow" are labels more than embodied experience. The transition from skepticism to acceptance in Elara feels unmotivated; her shift to "awe" arrives without visible internal friction or cost. Aris's "obliging nature" is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (xenobiology station, Aris, drone repair). The dominant stake—proving temporal displacement—is signaled early and the lever-pull provides a visible turn. However, the closure lacks felt cost: the discovery lands without sacrifice, resistance, or trade-off; Elara's immediate agreement and the "profoundly calm" acceptance deflate pressure rather than charge the final image. Under a Causal lens, the ending reads as confirmation rather than a change that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology station, magnetic nexus, and hangar are anchored with selective sensory detail (violet twilight, chilly air, amber light). The holographic emitter and lever are concrete props that matter to the action. The "mechanically warm" console recurs and the nexus visually constrains the timing, charging the closure moment when the hologram renders the lattice—meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving time moves sideways) is present throughout and the lever initiates a meaningful turn. Yet the escalation is intellectual rather than forced by rising cost: no credible opposition, no foreclosed path, no visible price paid. Elara's shift from skepticism to support is a micro-reversal, but it arrives through persuasion rather than a choice under duress. The final "calm" acknowledgment undercuts the sense of consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of lateral time and perception-shift emerges through particulars (spore paths, bat-moth vanishing, nexus lattice) rather than assertion. The holographic visualization offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, "subdued awakenings" and "icy warmth" are repeated as labels without evolving meaning, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a new paradigm took root… serene certainty of truth") rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and Aris's perceptual signature (mechanic's idiom, nexus-watching) is consistent. Dialogue between Aris and Elara carries subtext and advances the argument, though their voices converge in register ("temporal displacement, not just spatial" / "a sheet being folded"). The prose modulates appropriately with the revelation beat, and there is no head-hopping or filter-verb excess in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or plot. The opening and closing images are purposeful. Minor loops appear: "subdued awakenings" recurs four times as a thematic label without fresh embodiment, and "icy warmth" appears three times in similar constructions. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deduction to −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lateral-time premise and holographic visualization offer a moderately fresh angle on temporal paradox. The combination of xenobiology station, magnetic nexus, and bat-moth migration is specific and internally coherent. However, the narrative arc—lone scientist proves unconventional theory, skeptic becomes ally, discovery achieved without resistance—follows a recognizable template. The emotional resolution (calm, shared understanding) opts for safety over bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Aris frames the opening, performs the lever action, and shares the discovery—three beats. His "obliging" trait is mentioned but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Present in closure (watches hologram, smiles) but not causally active there; the discovery itself drives the ending. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; moderate causal pressure and beat involvement push mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is seeded early (violet twilight, amber light), powers the timing constraint (peak intensity minutes away), and becomes the data source for the holographic lattice at closure. It appears in at least three beats and its specific properties (magnetic field gradients, temporal folding) are irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure; the nexus shapes both the discovery and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" is named four times but functions primarily as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. It colors Aris's approach (slow, sure understanding) but does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a visible cost. Setup present, payoff in final paragraphs as mood, but middle development is ornamental. The element could be removed and the plot would run unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" is mentioned three times (drone core, tools, console) as sensory detail but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. It provides atmosphere in the cold hangar but remains decorative. Setup and closure-adjacent reprise are present, yet no middle choice hinges on it. Swappable with "steady hum" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lever is introduced mid-story, built from scrap shuttle parts, and pulling it initiates the simulation—the story's central turn. It drives two beats (preparation, activation) and directly shapes the closure by rendering the temporal lattice. Present in the final third and essential to the climax. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong; minor late-introduction penalty applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Holographic principles are seeded early ("holographic emitter," "conceived through holographic principles"), enable Aris's method (projecting nexus data across dimensional axes), and the emitter brightens during the climax to render the lattice. Present in setup, development, and payoff; the mechanics matter and the visualization is irreplaceable. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage justify upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station anchors location and provides the hangar lab, biologists studying spores, and dormant bat-moths—world details that enrich context. Elara's presence and the station's mission supply minor pressure (professional respect, collaborative ethos). However, the station itself does not constrain Aris's choices or alter tactics; the discovery could occur in any isolated lab. Functional but replaceable as a pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" recurs twice as a lyric phrase marking dormant bat-moths and silence, but it does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The chronometer notes "minutes away" for nexus peak, creating mild urgency, yet no countdown alters tactics on the page. Setup and payoff reprise present, middle development weak; the element reweights atmosphere but not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Aris's desire to prove lateral time is stated early, drives his drone work and holographic method, and finds fulfillment in the climax revelation. It shapes at least three beats (repair motivation, simulation design, lever decision) and is causally indispensable. The motivation is somewhat declarative rather than conflicted—no visible cost or competing want—but its presence across setup, development, and payoff, plus direct closure linkage, earns solid score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is named three times (Elara's tone, the data-realization moment, final science description) and attempts to unify professional rigor with emotional charge. The tone modulates from skepticism to awe and shapes the ending's calm register. However, the phrase is applied as a label rather than enacted through contradictory sensory or emotional beats. Setup, development, and reprise present; moderate thematic charge but limited embodiment.</comment>
