<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Keeper's internal state is vivid and concrete—"dimensionally homesick" and "feral library guardian" ground her choices in embodied particulars. The pendant acceptance is motivated, but the shift from threat-assessment to cataloging impulse reads thin; the interior progression relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("homesickness...was a blade") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final stance crystallization is present but lacks micro-choices under visible pressure that would foreclose a live path with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The pendant intrusion supplies a meaningful tightening, and the ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the mist becomes medium, boundaries soften, and Keeper's wait shifts from passive to active. Cost is felt in the homesickness remaining "a datum" rather than resolved, and the garden transformation is irreversible. One causal seam: the visions "assaulted her" but her response (acceptance) lacks dramatized struggle, weakening the turn's linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: "ice-laden branch," "pooled in weak, defined circles," "sickly green hues" after the pendant's arrival. The boundaries of light constrain movement and shift at closure, charging the final image with gradients replacing walls. Spatial choreography is clean, and the mist evolves from veil to medium with clear causal pressure. Minor: the cultist's body "melting the frost" is mentioned but not used tactically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: stewardship of the archive and peace with uncertainty, signaled early. The pendant intrusion forces a meaningful choice—destroy or catalog—and Keeper's method (interiorizing) narrows options with visible cost: the garden transforms, boundaries soften, homesickness persists. One tightening is sufficient at this length, and the escalation fits the Accumulative lens. Weakness: the visions deliver understanding passively; Keeper does not wrestle with conflicting impulses on the page, reducing felt agency at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: acceptance of uncertainty, interiorizing the unknown, patient vigil without tidy closure. The pendant's whispered chaos becomes a truth to understand rather than destroy. The ending offers a resonant answer—"She was not alone in her vigil"—that reweights homesickness without stating a moral. Minor drift: "make friends with uncertainty" is articulated by the narrator mid-story in near-prompt language, diluting emergence slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; distance modulates cleanly with pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: "feral library guardian," "foggy lucidity," cataloging instinct filtering all observation. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") appear but fit the contemplative register. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the ending, moving from close interiority to wider glimpses of other guardians without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Two frictions lower the score: repeated metaphor stems ("She was," "She had," "She would") across the final paragraphs create template cadence; and the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" appears twice in quick succession without evolving meaning, reading as scaffold. No loops touch the closure image, limiting penalty spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive stewardship, dimensional exile, and cataloging chaos as acceptance is specific and non-obvious. The transformation from rigid boundaries to gradients charges the premise with fresh inflection. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric-accumulative design without retreating to tidy moral. One friction: "feral library guardian" and "dimensionally homesick" feel prompt-adjacent, though the execution grounds them in lived detail. The final glimpse of other quiet guardians elevates originality without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Keeper's choice to catalog the pendant rather than destroy it creates the key turn; her acceptance (hanging it around her neck) enables the garden's transformation. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending. Agency is clear but the decision lacks visible struggle on the page, reducing indispensability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pendant intrudes, whispers visions, warps light into green hues, and becomes the weight Keeper accepts; it appears in at least three beats and charges the closure. The transformation it triggers is irreversible and specific to its properties. Swappability test passes: no generic artifact would carry the same "key meant to lock a door, not open one" logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Boundaries of light define movement, constrain tactics (stepping out means "formless chill"), and transform at closure into gradients. The concept shapes stakes throughout: rigid circles become horizons. Present in setup, middle pressure, and ending image. The shift from "stark boundaries" to "edges blending into the mist" is causally tied to Keeper's acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is established early, sharpens into "a blade" when the pendant whispers of elsewhere, and reweights at closure as "a datum...properly labeled and filed." It pressures the acceptance choice but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with cost; the tradeoff remains internal and abstract. Present across all three gates but lacks mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Waiting is Keeper's core duty, transforms from "perpetual and patient" to "active, open-ended waiting...directed toward possibility." The shift redefines her stance and charges the ending: "She would wait, friend to the mist." Present in setup, implicit in middle choices, and explicit at closure. Removing "wait" would collapse the character's arc, though the action itself is static.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is named as Keeper's ancient method, drives her approach to the pendant ("take the wild, external thing and give it a place"), and completes at closure when she interiorizes "the greatest exterior of all: the unknown." Signaled early, shapes the middle beat's choice, and articulates the ending. The mechanics matter: cataloging as acceptance, not destruction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden supplies movement constraints (light circles vs. mist), evolves causally (blooms gleam amber, boundaries soften), and charges the ending with transformed atmosphere. Micro-setting elements (bench of frozen roots, frosted twig) anchor action. The garden is irreplaceable: no other setting would support the boundary-shift logic or archival metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" frames the cultist's arrival and Keeper's dormant state. Time is present but vague: "One cycle" signals duration without tightening tactics. The ending mentions "dreamed, wide awake," reprising the sleep motif with reweighted meaning. Present in setup and closure, absent in middle pressure; no live clock alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to make friends with uncertainty" is buried initially ("She did not know this yet"), surfaces mid-story as understanding, and culminates in acceptance: "friend to the mist, guardian of the frozen, living text." It shapes the pendant choice (understand vs. destroy) with visible cost (homesickness persists). Friction between stated and enacted desire is present but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is established in the opening line, modulates through the pendant's "sickly green" distortion, and charges the ending: "foggy lucidity settle[s] over her soul" as clarity and mist coexist. Tone coheres across all turns and reconfigures at closure, blending precision with ambiguity without confusion. The final phrase "dreamed, wide awake" crystallizes the tonal paradox with cost.</comment>
