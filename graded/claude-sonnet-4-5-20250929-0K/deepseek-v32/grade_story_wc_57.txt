<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract—"infinitely patient" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The weavers' acceptance feels unmotivated; no on-page friction tests her patience or forces a trade-off between methods. The final success arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, weakening the sense of earned change. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is labeled ("profound peace") rather than shown through perception and gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the knot-decoding accumulates meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the weavers emerge and share. Closure occurs on the page (the weavers speak, legacy entrusted), but the cost is conceptual and faint—no live option is foreclosed, no felt price paid. Orientation anchors arrive early (golden dock, Elara, fog). One meaningful deepening (knot comprehension → weaver emergence) tightens the quest, but the resolution feels granted rather than earned by protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, fog, and fulgurite glass create vivid atmosphere and coherent sensory texture. The rope and bollard anchor micro-setting, and the fulgurite is used twice (examination tool, gift). However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara kneels and decodes without spatial friction. The final image (harbor gleaming, fog lifting) charges thematically but does not reweight a prior stake through setting pressure, capping the score below 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve ancient methods) is signaled early, but pressure remains static—Elara decodes knots without friction, reversal, or escalation. No tightening narrows options; the weavers simply appear when she finishes, and trust is granted after one gesture. Agency is passive observation rather than decision with cost. The ending delivers success without trade-off or visible price, undercutting the sense of earned stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (preservation, patience, tactile scripture) emerges from concrete images—knots as language, fulgurite as offering—without overt statement. The final image (seed pod warm with promise) offers a non-literal answer to the preservation question. However, thematic depth is limited by the absence of complication or counter-pressure; the resolution is tidy and symmetric, granting full success without moral ambiguity or cost that lingers. Subtext in the weavers' acceptance is thin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("oceanic hush," "calligraphy of our hands") that matches the contemplative tone. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract high-register phrasing ("agricultural epic," "communion") that feels more authorial than Elara's immediate perception. The weavers' single line of dialogue is distinct, but overall voice specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid images (fulgurite's lightning-forged filaments, frost-rimed rope). Several paraphrase loops appear: "secret weavers" recurs four times in opening paragraphs without pressure variation; "infinite patience" is asserted twice adjacently. Template cadence is mild but present in the middle third ("Each knot was... a series of hitches... a bowline variant"). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors harm clarity. Information density is moderate—some sentences advance atmosphere more than action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (philosophical seed collector decoding knots to summon guardians) offers a fresh synthesis of elements, and the knot-as-language conceit is specific. However, the emotional arc and resolution feel template-safe: patient scholar proves worth, receives wisdom, departs with legacy intact. No bold risk or subversion; the quest succeeds without complication or moral ambiguity. The final image (warm seed pod) is symbolic convenience rather than a non-obvious turn earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her collector role frames the quest, but her choices are minimal—she kneels, decodes, offers the glass. These are observations and gestures, not decisions that alter tactics or create turns. The weavers' emergence is a response to her comprehension, not her agency. Missing middle development and causal pressure cap the score; she is more vessel than driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fulgurite appears in three beats: clutched as offering, used to examine rope nuances, lifted and given to the weaver. Setup is early, development functional (examination tool), payoff present (gift accepted). However, its properties (lightning-forged) do not constrain or enable a choice; glass as magnifier is replaceable. Specificity is thematic (natural artistry) but not causal. Solid integration across beats without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret weavers shape the quest from the opening: Elara seeks them, decodes their knot-language, and they emerge to share knowledge. Setup is immediate, development occurs (knot comprehension summons them), payoff is the oral transmission. They define the stakes and provide closure. However, their mechanics (how knots summon, why they trust) remain vague, limiting causal specificity. Present across all three gates with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is asserted twice and described ("worn into her bones," "absolute"), but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elara's decoding takes unspecified hours, but no impatience tempts her, no trade-off tests the trait. It is a label without friction or visible consequence. Missing middle development and cost connection; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coax" frames the quest and recurs: she aims to coax knowledge, later coaxes "no further," letting weavers choose to speak. It shapes the final beat (weavers volunteer rather than being pressed). Setup and payoff are present. However, the action is passive—waiting rather than active persuasion—and could be replaced by "earn trust" or "invite" without structural loss. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Knot-decoding is signaled early, drives the middle (each knot reveals cultivation lore), and enables closure (comprehension summons weavers). The method is specific (hitches, bowline variant, crown knot) and irreplaceable—removing it breaks the summoning logic. Present across all three gates with strong causal role. Cost is conceptual (time, study) rather than visceral, limiting the top band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow is established immediately, anchors Elara's position, and returns in the final image. Fog and snow create atmosphere. The setting is vivid and present at closure but does not constrain choice—Elara could decode anywhere. Bollard and rope are props, not spatial friction. Lyric reprise (opening/closing dock image) reweights tone but not tactics, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fog rolling across the harbor frames the opening and lifts at the end, bracketing the quest. "Hours might have passed" is vague—no live clock tightens decisions. Time is atmospheric, not tactical. Setup and payoff present, but missing development (no mid-scene pressure from elapsed time). Functional backdrop without urgency or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Preserving ancient methods is Elara's stated goal, drives her quest to the dock, and is fulfilled when weavers share. Setup immediate, payoff clear. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between preservation and another want, no cost that tests commitment. The desire succeeds without trade-off. Present across gates with moderate causal role but low conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Oceanic hush is established early ("muffled the world," "breath held") and sustained through fog, silence, and whispered exchange, modulating slightly (deepens to "profound peace") at closure. Tone coheres across beats and charges the final image. However, it remains static—no pressure-driven shift or tonal friction. A single contemplative register without modulation or cost limits the upper band.</comment>
