<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's role is established but her interior life reads ornamental rather than contradictory. Her "purpose, etched into her soul" and "synesthetically blessed perception" are declared traits without visible cost or friction; she executes a predetermined ritual without genuine doubt or competing impulse. The tears at the end gesture toward emotion but arrive as label rather than embodied pressure. No micro-choice under stress reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—layered sensory cascades building toward a release—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush shattering, wonder unfettered). The closure participates: "wonder, unfettered, poured forth" reweights the premise with visible change. However, cost is asserted ("tears freezing") rather than dramatized through forfeited options or tactical friction, and the sculptor parallel remains decorative coincidence rather than motivated convergence, weakening causal elegance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern anchors early and its walls, fissures, and the sculpted hush at the core constrain Elara's bell sequence and provide the medium for wonder's escape. Synesthetic color-painting is vivid and POV-specific. The aurora outside supplies the harmonic key, pressuring the timing window. The environment charges the final image (wonder "weav[ing] itself into the very ice"), satisfying the Q3 gate for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—unfettering the sculpted hush to certify wonder—signals early and tightens through the aurora's timing window. The moment approaches, pressure builds via "heart hammered," and the great bass bell triggers the release. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; Elara executes a known ritual without adapting or trading off. The sculptor synchrony complicates symbolically but does not alter Elara's tactics or impose visible cost, leaving agency ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: wonder as essential is certified by the hush's physical release, not sermon. The amber sheet fading to transparency and the ice glowing with "internal luminescence" offer resonant images. Yet the final paragraph leans toward stated meaning ("wonder was certified essential," "world now reminded of magic") rather than letting the sensory particulars hold the weight alone, nudging toward thematic echo and weakening the non-literal charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's synesthetic filter colors all perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("oscillating repose," "ultramarine," "rainbow tsunami") without head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into declarative abstraction ("certification was not a document, but an experience etched into reality") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is vivid but does not degrade under stress, missing an opportunity for rhythmic modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence variety and figurative density are high; color imagery cascades without mid-beat muddle. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "She read," "Each subsequent bell," "She knew," "The moment approached" form a stack of similar stems. Paraphrase loop: "The sculpted hush responded… Its edges began to gleam, as if long-forgotten chords were straining" restates crystalline vibration across adjacent lines without added pressure. Stock metaphor "rainbow tsunami" in the climax dilutes specificity. Line-level artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure image, capping penalty at −0.6 per Text Artifact guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synesthesia-bell-aurora convergence offers a fresh synthesis of elements. Yet the core frame—lone keeper performs ancient ritual to release imprisoned wonder into a dulled world—follows familiar fantasy-quest structure without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The sculptor parallel is decorative coincidence rather than causal or thematic integration. Emotional stakes remain abstract (certifying wonder) rather than grounded in personal cost or contradiction, leaving the premise mid-originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her bell sequence drives the central action. She appears early, her choices (lifting bells, reading the sheet, striking the bass bell) span three beats, and her role is causally active at closure. However, her decisions execute a predetermined ritual without adaptation or visible tradeoff; she does not alter tactics under pressure. The synesthetic filter colors perception but does not constrain choice. Swappable with "ritual keeper" without structural loss, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is introduced early ("Her only tool"), used actively in the bell sequence ("She read the first phrase"), and reappears at closure ("had faded to clear, golden transparency, its duty done"). Three beats, purposeful early-to-final arc. However, its mechanics—how she reads shifting hues, whether alternatives existed—remain vague, and its fading is descriptive rather than constraining a subsequent choice. Strong reprise reweights meaning, but lacks causal irreplaceability, capping near 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sculpted hush is central: it frames the stake (unfetter it), responds to the bells ("vibrating in sympathetic resonance"), and shatters at closure, releasing wonder. Present in setup, middle escalation, and payoff. It is not merely thematic but physically acted upon, and its release alters the world state. Removing it would collapse the plot. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage all strong; only slight abstraction in its nature ("palpable stillness shaped by ancient hands") prevents full irreplaceability score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia is declared early and colors every bell tone with ribbons of light and cascading hues. However, it functions as descriptive texture rather than constraint or cost; Elara never misreads a note, suffers sensory overload, or adapts her method due to the trait. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff or enabling action under pressure. Present across beats but ornamental, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unfetter is the story's central verb: Elara's goal is to "unfetter the captive marvel," and the climax is "Wonder, unfettered, poured forth." The action shapes setup (what must be done), middle (preparation through bell tones), and payoff (the hush shattering and wonder escaping). Causal across all three beats and closure participation undeniable. However, the mechanics of unfettering are atmospheric rather than tactically specified, and the action could be renamed "release" or "free" with minimal edits, capping specificity bonus.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The aurora is signaled early ("faint external glow of the northern lights beginning to dance"), its spectrum provides the harmonic key ("the aurora's spectrum would provide the key"), and it flares at the climax to unlock the hush. Present in setup, middle theory, and payoff. However, the mechanics—how its colors merge with bell-born hues to achieve convergence—remain asserted rather than demonstrated through tactical constraint. Strong closure linkage but mid-level causal specificity, placing it in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is established early, its walls reflect the aurora, and the central hush is "frozen deep within the ice." The environment supplies the medium (fissures and channels for wonder's escape) and charges the ending image (ice "now glowed with internal luminescence"). Setup, development, and payoff all present. However, the cavern does not alter Elara's tactics or impose spatial constraint during the ritual; it is stage rather than obstacle. Closure participation and reprise earn mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's chisel moment is mentioned in setup ("Today, at the precise moment") and converges at climax ("At the exact instant the chisel touched stone"). Two touches, early signal, and closure participation. However, the timeframe does not tighten Elara's decisions or alter her tactics; the synchrony is coincidental and symbolic rather than causally pressuring her sequence. Swappable with any distant event. Lyric reprise without mid-development, capping near 4.0 per missing middle gate and low causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Certifying wonder as essential is stated early ("Her purpose, etched into her soul") and restated at closure ("wonder was certified essential"). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Elara never weighs competing desires or sacrifices an alternative; the ritual proceeds without friction. Label-only motivation without on-page tradeoff, fitting the 5–6 band for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Oscillating repose is named mid-story ("Elara felt the oscillating repose of her task, a rhythm between frantic action and meditative calm") and echoed at closure ("settled into a gentle hum… active peace"). The tone modulates from atmospheric buildup to climactic intensity to quiet aftermath, supporting the arc. However, the phrase itself is abstract and the oscillation is asserted rather than enacted through sentence rhythm or contradictory impulses in action. Present in middle and payoff with coherent modulation but lacks craft specificity, capping near 6.0.</comment>
