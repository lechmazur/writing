<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and his gift of hearing unspoken words is established, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to organize window displays feels more narrated than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. His core trait—hearing unspoken words—remains largely decorative; it's told but never constrains a choice or creates friction in a pivotal beat. The final image of cradling hope is emblematic but not earned through prior struggle that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story signals one dominant stake (silent resistance to the mayor's ban) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when candles light and the mayor reconsiders, but the middle escalation is largely summarized ("Over the next week, Leo used his chess sessions..."). The orientation is clear early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the window displays create a visual constellation that reweights the town's stance. However, the mayor's shift in "the days that followed" moves key consequence off the page, weakening closure cost visibility and reducing the felt price of Leo's rebellion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vivid and recur, and the mist/starlight atmosphere is consistent. However, neither setting constrains a choice at a pivotal beat—Leo's plan crystallizes in the library, but any quiet space would serve equally well. The grotto functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is clean and the sensory palette (mist, marble, old paper) is selective, but the high-9 gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (organizing silent resistance) is signaled early, but the core escalation—sharing the plan, gathering at the grotto, the night of candles—is narrated in summary rather than dramatized with on-page reversals. The mayor's "second thoughts" appear as tell, not shown cost or friction. The rebellion succeeds without visible sacrifice or tactical adjustment under pressure, and coincidence (the mayor simply reconsidering) resolves the conflict rather than Leo's agency at a closure beat. One meaningful tightening is present (the candles light), but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise of silent solidarity, and the imagery of light/constellations/forests supports it without overt moralizing. The story resists simplistic binaries and allows the rebellion's success to rest on collective action rather than force. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some rebellions are won not by force, but by gentle, persistent light") that states rather than dramatizes the question. The annual tradition coda dilutes the immediacy of the ending image, and Leo's reflection on "moves that mattered beyond the board" hovers close to prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Leo with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, filtering through chess metaphors) is present but not always leveraged under pressure. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate, though some figurative language ("amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts") recurs as thematic shorthand rather than evolving specificity. Dialogue is minimal and functional when present. The phrase "during the hush where past meets prophecy" is repeated verbatim across beats without reweighting, reducing rhythmic variety. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and no major loops. However, several phrases recur as template anchors without pattern-teaching: "amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts," "during the hush where past meets prophecy" (three instances). The figurative density is high in connective tissue ("cradle" extended across multiple beats, "magnetic pull of hope") without always advancing scene pressure. Information density is moderate; key escalation beats are summarized rather than shown, reducing propulsion. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so the penalty remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise of synchronized window candles as silent rebellion offers a fresh visual, and the combination of chess coach + unspoken-word gift + magnetic grotto is specific. However, the core emotional arc (teacher organizes quiet resistance, mayor reconsiders) follows a recognizable template without a transformative twist or non-obvious moral calculus. The story commits fully to its premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. The ending image (cradling hope, blooming peace) resolves into familiar idiom rather than a resonant surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Leo appears throughout and his role as chess coach enables the metaphor for teaching strategy, but his coaching itself does not create a key turn—he could be any trusted community figure. The chess diagrams are mentioned but not shown constraining a choice. Present in setup, middle (teaching sessions), and ending reflection, but swappable with "community organizer" or "librarian" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in backstory, is revisited during the planning meeting, and returns in the final reflection with the wounded bird. However, its magnetic properties do not constrain or enable a tactical choice—it functions as symbolic meeting place rather than a lever that alters options. The grotto shapes two beats (planning, reflection) but could be replaced by any secluded gathering spot. Charges the final image with continuity but not indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of humble rebellion structures the entire narrative: Leo rejects loud protest in favor of synchronized candles, and the story tracks the method, execution, and consequence. It shapes stakes (silent vs. violent resistance) and tactics (window displays, chess-diagram communication). Present in setup, drives middle choices, and the ending image ("gentle, persistent light") articulates the concept's payoff. The mayor's reconsideration is consequence, though told rather than shown. Strongly integrated but not quite indispensable—other forms of quiet resistance could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Leo's ability to hear unspoken words is established early and mentioned repeatedly ("he heard the unspoken words of his neighbors"), but it never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. It decorates his interiority without enabling a turn or forcing a tradeoff. The trait could be removed and the plot would function identically. Ornamental use throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The action "cradle" appears in multiple beats: Leo cradles the chess queen, the child cradles the wounded bird, Leo cradles the feeling of hope. It extends thematically (nurture, protect) and the final instance charges the ending image. However, the word itself is swappable—"hold," "shelter," "embrace" would serve with minor edits. The concept of cradling matters more than the verb's specificity. Present across beats and in closure, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Organizing synchronized window displays is signaled early (Leo's plan crystallizes in the library), the method is explained (chess diagrams, specific hour), and the execution is shown on-page when candles light. The mechanics matter: the visual constellation creates the rebellion's impact. Shapes setup, middle planning, and the climax. Removal would break the story's logic. The display itself drives the mayor's response, making it essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The cobalt library is introduced in the opening, returns as the site where Leo's plan crystallizes, and is mentioned again as a symbol in the ending. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—any quiet sanctuary would serve. The setting is vivid and coherent but remains postcard-descriptive rather than tactical. Present in setup and thematic closure but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The phrase "during the hush where past meets prophecy" recurs three times but functions as lyric atmosphere rather than a live clock. No urgency or tightening of decisions is tied to this temporal frame; the story's events could occur in any evening. The timeframe is ornamental, not causal. Present as tone but does not shape tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to plant "forests of second thoughts" is stated early, drives his choice to organize the window displays, and is referenced at closure ("had taken root"). The desire shapes his method (quiet persuasion rather than confrontation) and is tested when the mayor reconsiders. However, the friction between want and cost is told more than shown—Leo's internal conflict or sacrifice is not dramatized. Functional across beats with thematic payoff, but replaceable with any anti-authoritarian motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone of "amplified quiet" is coherent throughout: mist, silence, whispered words, the hush of the library, and the noiseless rebellion via candles. The phrase itself recurs and the ending image ("gentle, persistent light") reinforces it. Tone modulates appropriately—calm planning, tense waiting, collective release—and charges the final beat. However, the repetition of "amplified quiet" as a phrase trends toward label rather than sensory embodiment. Strong integration, nearly essential to the story's identity.</comment>
