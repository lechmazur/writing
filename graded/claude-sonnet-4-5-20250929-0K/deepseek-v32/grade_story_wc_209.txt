<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but her choices remain largely observational—she studies, mixes paint, and steps back without on-page conflict or visible cost. The "quiet drive" is a label; we never see a contradictory impulse or a moment where her commitment to understanding night blooms forecloses another option. The grandmother's backstory anchors interiority, but the final "peaceful certainty" arrives without dramatized struggle or tradeoff. Embodied emotion is thin; most beats summarize her state rather than showing pressure through contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (amber pavilion, autumn, mural artist with postcards). The lens reads accumulative/textural: layers of observation, painting, and reflection build toward the final insight about solace in darkness. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she understands the night flowers' purpose and her mural reflects this), but the cost is conceptual and barely legible—no visible forfeit or path foreclosed, just "peaceful certainty." The piece compresses several months (autumn → winter → spring) in a manner that blurs causal linkage; many beats feel like and-then sequencing rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The amber pavilion filters light, the cathedral window's etched glass teaches layered perception, and the postcards anchor the workspace. These elements create atmosphere and recur purposefully. However, setting does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains descriptive backdrop. The "honeyed light," "lattice walls," and seasonal transitions are vivid but ornamental. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the pavilion's amber glass does charge the final moment when morning light touches the mural, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete test. Elara visits the cathedral, studies glass, paints a mural; none of these steps narrow options or reveal a trade-off. No reversal occurs; the arc is additive research → insight without escalation. The final "reckoning" about human tenderness is delivered as summary rather than earned through a choice under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency; the story drifts toward thematic completion without visible cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in darkness, solace in uncertain times, umbral tenderness—emerges from the night-blooming flowers and the grandmother's legacy. The final image (mural glowing in morning light, flowers seeming to breathe) offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the last two paragraphs veer into explicit thematic summary: "some questions are answered not with words, but with color and light" and the direct statement about flowers offering solace. These declarations replace scene pressure and undercut the subtlety built earlier. The postcards and etched glass do constrain how she thinks, but the ending opts for clarity over resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with Elara's perceptual filter consistent throughout. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush"), matching an artistic sensibility but occasionally slipping into abstraction ("quiet drive," "artistic reckoning"). No dialogue appears; interiority dominates. The prose texture is purposeful—long, flowing sentences mirror her contemplative process—but the register remains uniform even across emotional beats, missing modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary, rhythm is controlled, and figurative language ("amber pavilion," "honeyed light," "umbral tenderness") is consistent. However, several beats loop conceptually: paragraphs 12–13 restate the layered-glass insight, paragraphs 19–20 rehearse the night-flower theme, and the final two paragraphs repeat closure ideas. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She [verb]…, her [noun]…" stems across multiple lines). Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") stack in the final quarter, dulling immediacy at closure. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence; no artifact touches the exact closure sentence but several appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—artist inherits postcards of night-blooming flowers, creates mural to understand them—is functional but derivative (gentle artist seeks meaning through inherited heirloom, finds closure in finished artwork). The cathedral glass as teaching tool and the seasonal timeframe add specificity, but the arc follows a familiar template: solitary creative process → insight → peaceful completion. The final realization (flowers bloom at night to offer solace) is earnest but not surprising. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for safe, lyrical execution over fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is on-page throughout and her profession (mural artist) frames the setting and action. However, her choices are largely observational—she studies, paints, and reflects—without on-page conflict or decision that alters tactics. The final moment of clarity is internal, not a choice that forecloses a path. She is present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but her agency is passive. Functional but replaceable with another artist archetype; no specific trait of hers drives a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The postcards appear early (paragraph 2), are described as faded with cryptic notes, serve as reference throughout Elara's painting process, and return at closure when she places them in a box "their purpose fulfilled." They anchor her motivation and recur across beats. However, they are never handled dynamically—no moment where a postcard constrains a choice or forces a trade-off. They enable the quest but do not shape a turn. Strong setup and closure presence, but development is static.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears twice: paragraph 8 ("she pondered the flowers' secret lives") and paragraph 20 ("wrapped around her" as she grasps the flowers' purpose). It establishes atmosphere but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. The concept is thematic echo rather than stake-shaping force. Present at setup and closure but ornamental; easily swappable with another contemplative mood.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated in paragraph 2 and restated as "quiet drive" in paragraph 31. It labels Elara's temperament but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. No moment where her quietness forecloses a louder option, or where being driven forces a tradeoff. Label-only attribute; no visible friction or causal work on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reckon" and "reckoning" appear three times: paragraph 5 ("artistic reckoning"), paragraph 16 ("reckoned with her grandmother's legacy"), and paragraph 27 ("This reckoning was not just about botany"). The act shapes the thematic insight at closure, but it is delivered as summary rather than dramatized decision. The verb is somewhat specific (acknowledging and confronting legacy) but could be replaced with "understand" or "come to terms" with minor edits. Present across beats and at closure, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cathedral window's etched glass appears in paragraphs 9–12, teaching Elara that layered perspective reveals concealed colors and stories. This method directly informs her mural technique (merging postcard images with luminous geometry) and is recalled at closure (paragraph 29) as the lesson that "revelation comes through patience." It is signaled early, used in the middle to alter her approach, and echoed at the end. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no scene where she physically examines the glass or discovers a layer that changes her tactic. Functional across all three gates but summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is established in paragraph 1, its glass filters light throughout (paragraph 6, 25, 34), and the final clarity occurs there (paragraph 25). The setting provides atmosphere and recurs at key moments, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Elara could paint anywhere; the pavilion is evocative but does not constrain her process. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but postcard description rather than micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("autumn," paragraph 1; "across the melting of winter's last snow," paragraph 5) and tracked loosely through seasonal markers (winter's grip loosens, last patches of snow vanish, spring arrives). Paragraph 24 notes "Elara worked through the final days of winter," tying the mural's completion to the thaw. However, time is vague and does not tighten decisions—no deadline or clock that forces a tactical choice. The melting snow is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Present across beats but does not constrain; swappable with another seasonal arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to understand why flowers bloom at night"—is stated in paragraph 4, drives her study of the cathedral window (paragraph 9), and is answered at closure (paragraph 26: "flowers bloom at night to offer solace to those who wander in darkness"). It frames the quest and recurs across beats, but is never conflicted or tested by cost. Elara faces no friction between this desire and another need; the motivation is singular and passive. Present in all three gates and shapes the ending, but told-only without on-page friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is named in paragraph 14, restated in paragraph 28 ("reflected this umbral tenderness"), and implicit in the final image (gentle glow, peaceful certainty). The tone is coherent—soft, contemplative, shadowed—throughout, without modulation under pressure. The piece maintains a static lyrical mood rather than shifting cadence at turns. Present at setup and closure but does not charge the final image with felt pressure; the tone remains uniform and ornamental.</comment>
