<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris is present and his motivation is stated, but his choices are presented as already successful rather than tested under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; the "perceptively calm" stance never wavers or costs him anything on the page. The borrowed heartbeat concept is told rather than dramatized through embodied choice, and the final walk-away reads as a graceful exit rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost. No relationship crucible or secondary pressure appears to test him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through prismatic imagery and coded song, building toward the mirrors' flicker and final fade. Orientation anchors (terrace, spring dusk, Aris alone) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the oldest mirror wavers and others follow, reweighting the stake from attempt to partial success. However, the cost at closure is conceptual and implied rather than felt or visible on the page—the visions fade, but no path is foreclosed and no trade-off is dramatized. The bells ring and Aris walks away unchanged, which weakens the closure unit under RR (no stance crystallization with pressure) or CR (the conceptual price is asserted in "forever changed" rather than shown).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet and terrace are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp spring air, warm stone, prismatic colors). The environment constrains Aris's work—he uses the rainbows on wet stone, the echoing terrace, and the city's pulse below—so it shapes his method and charges the final image when the prism "still seemed to hold a memory." Spatial choreography is clean. Micro-setting (the parapet) functions as a tool that enables his attempt, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the ending reconfiguration is told ("forever changed") rather than shown through a choice that the setting forces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: persuade mirrors to show possibilities. One meaningful deepening occurs when the oldest mirror flickers and others follow, narrowing the question from "will it work?" to "how fully will it work?" However, escalation is driven by the mirrors' response rather than Aris's agency under pressure—he continues the same method throughout. No visible cost or trade-off appears; the bells break the spell but Aris walks away unchanged. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift (hush → bells → afterglow) reweights the moment, but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—possibility versus fixed truth—emerges from the mirror persuasion rather than overt statement. The prism and coded lullaby recur with purpose. However, the ending declares the terrace "forever changed" and the world "wider" instead of letting the image carry that weight. The borrowed heartbeat concept is stated but not dramatized as a moral or emotional cost; Aris returns his heartbeat to himself without friction. The final image (dry parapet with memory of rainbows) offers a resonant note but is undercut by the closing thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "perceptively calm," filtering through light, sound, and mirage-work. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("dusky harmony," "spectral bands"), fitting the elusive painter's stance. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("his motivation was simple yet profound") and the final paragraph over-explains the transformation. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The voice modulates minimally under pressure, as Aris remains calm throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Overwriting appears in stacked modifiers and near-synonym phrases: "perceptively calm" recurs as label; "echoing terrace" and "prism parapet" are named repeatedly without new information. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes ("forever changed," "the world felt wider"), reducing closure propulsion. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraph four ("dusky harmony settled" / "Aris continued his coded song" / "He needed them to see beyond"). No template cadence or major grammar errors, but density sacrifices momentum in peak beats. Closure artifact penalty applies for the summary ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mirage painter premise and coded lullaby method offer a fresh angle. However, the execution leans on abstraction—"borrowed heartbeat," "ancient song," "grace"—without grounding these in specific, irreplaceable detail that would make the story inevitable. The mirrors' transformation is told in概括 terms (a hundred terraces, a thousand springs) rather than one concrete vision that Aris needs and cannot have. The ending's promise and wider world read as stock closure gestures. Transformation test: the plot would function identically with "illusionist" and "incantation" substituted for painter and lullaby.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout and frames the attempt. However, his choices do not create key turns—the mirrors respond to his method, and he does not alter tactics or face a decision. He begins calm and ends calm, walking away unchanged. The flicker moment is a result, not a choice. Present in setup, middle (continues method), and ending (walks away), but causal pressure is weak. Two gates (setup, ending presence) met; middle development is passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prism parapet is handled in multiple beats: refracts light at the start, glows as visions appear, and "still seemed to hold a memory" at the end. It enables Aris's method (weaving rainbows) and charges the final image. Present in setup, middle (active use), and ending (reprise with reweighted meaning). Causal pressure is moderate—it supplies the tool but does not narrow options. Cost connection is implied (dry, memory-only) but not felt as a trade-off. Strong lyric reprise with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early and named in the middle ("gave vitality to his illusions," "poured more of the borrowed rhythm"). It appears at the ending when Aris's "own heartbeat his own once more." However, it shapes stakes as concept rather than tactic—no on-page moment shows him stealing or returning the pulse with a choice or cost. One beat involvement (middle, when he listens and uses it). Lyric reprise qualifies (first third → final line) but no causal pressure or felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is label-only, appearing in the opening and once later ("perceptively calm at the center of the storm") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No cost or trade-off is tied to this trait. Aris's calm is asserted but never tested; he does not choose calm over urgency, nor does it limit him. Present in setup and mentioned in middle, absent from ending. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Grace" appears as attribute and action throughout: "inherent grace," "his grace a fluid dance," "the action of his grace," "persuaded them with grace." It enables his method (fluid movement conducting light) and is present at closure ("walked away"). However, it is treated as an inherent quality rather than a choice or tactic under pressure. No moment shows grace tested or traded off. Present in setup, middle (multiple beats), and ending. Functional but replaceable with "fluidity" or "elegance" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are introduced early ("method through coded lullabies"), mechanics are explained (childhood tune with hidden words), and the method is used across multiple beats (softly hums, continues the coded song, "lullaby softening their rigid logic"). Present at the ending when the spell breaks. The method shapes his attempt but does not change tactics—he uses the same song throughout. Three beats (setup, middle repetition, ending moment). Causal pressure is moderate; specificity is high (childhood tune, plea for doors). Swappability test: "incantation" could replace with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is setting and active element: it echoes the song back, its stone is warm, its walls hold mirrors, and the space frames all action. Present in setup, middle (affects method—echoing the tune, stone warmth), and ending (returns to "simple stone and shadow"). The terrace supplies spatial constraint (parapet, mirrors lining walls) and its acoustic property (echoing) enables the coded song to reach the mirrors. Strong micro-setting that alters tactics. Closure linkage is present but mild (the terrace is "forever changed" by assertion).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe is established early ("hush before the evening bells would ring"), tracked at midpoint ("hush deepened, the moment stretching thin as the bells' first chime gathered"), and payoff at the ending when "the first bronze note trembled" and "the sound of the bells rolled across." The approaching bell deadline tightens Aris's window and breaks the spell at closure. Live clock that alters the final beat—visions fade when the bells ring. Three gates met; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct and decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to persuade mirrors to show possibilities instead of facts") and drives all action. Aris attempts it, the mirrors resist, one flickers, others follow. Present in setup, middle (pursuit), and ending (task complete, mirrors hold new sights briefly). However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment shows Aris tempted to force rather than persuade, or weighing a cost. Told-only desire without friction between wants and costs. Two beats (attempt, partial success). Functional causal role but no trade-off dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named twice and evoked throughout via color and sound blending (blues and purples, light and silence, shadow and light). Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the mirage-painter concept. It modulates mildly as the bells approach and break the spell. Present in setup (painted dusk), middle ("dusky harmony settled," "dusky harmony was perfect now"), and ending ("dusky harmony of spring twilight"). The tone charges the final image with quiet closure rather than dramatic shift. Strong lyric integration but static mood—no pressure-driven modulation.</comment>
