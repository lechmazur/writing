<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is vivid and embodied through her tactile engagement with vials and the valve. Her compulsion to compile fragments anchors motivation, and her reactive gift creates a coherent constraint that shapes on-page choices. The final choice to share the mapped echoes rather than restore sound is earned, though the micro-choices en route (sorting, following the pulse, deciding to gather the exiles) feel slightly under-pressured—each step proceeds without visible hesitation or trade-off. The ending forecloses restoration with visible cost (the crushed bell) and pivots to collective heartening, which reads as renunciation with communal payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the phantom echoes map "navigated absences" into a legible lattice, heartening the exiles and foreclosing nostalgia for literal restoration. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: vials accumulate meaning through staggered intervals, culminating in a pattern-break spectacle that reweights the void as a diagram. Orientation anchors early (ivory harbor, Elara, post-exile). The valve's directional pull provides motivated linkage across beats, and the crushed bell closes one path while opening another. One meaningful deepening (realization that the trumpet was a framework, not just sound) tightens stakes and earns the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's rain-slicked quays, tarnished valve, derelict signal tower, and wet shale ground action in tactile specifics. The valve grows warm and guides movement, functioning as micro-setting that constrains Elara's path and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (dock, lighthouse base, culvert, signal tower, quay) remains clear. The post-rain atmosphere and salt-corroded case texture the world without excess. The harbor's emptiness and the valve's warmth both pressure and enable the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain or charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments into meaning to hearten the exiles) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the crushed bell forecloses literal restoration, forcing Elara to pivot from sound to mapped activity. The valve's pulse drives escalation through staggered intervals, and the final gathered spectacle reweights the void as a diagram. The story leans Accumulative; coincidence (finding the valve) complicates but does not resolve. Visible cost: the trumpet cannot be restored, and Elara's vision shifts from recovery to representation. The pivot feels slightly abrupt—one additional beat showing her wrestle with the impossibility would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (belonging emerges from understanding loss as structure, not void) arises from particulars: the valve's pulse, the mapped lattice, the phantom echoes. The final image (exiles pointing and smiling, valve warm and still) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing: they remember how to belong by seeing their past as a score. "Navigated absences" and "the score" risk slight abstraction but are anchored in the vial-release spectacle. No thematic echo or sermon. The crushed bell and the pivot to mapping rather than restoration charge the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady, focalized through Elara's reactive gift and tactile perception. Diction ("memory-impregnated sea spray," "sonic lattice," "navigated absences") carries a distinct, formal texture that fits an archivist's mindset. Voice modulates under pressure (sorting vials, following the pulse, final heartening). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Register remains stable; "hearten" and "compile fragments" feel idiomatically rooted in her role. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices sensory cues (cold valve, wet shale, ghostly resonance) and interprets through her archival lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary, and information density is high (each beat advances knowledge or stakes). Minor overwriting: "navigated absences," "reactively visionary," "memory-impregnated sea spray" cluster in the opening third, creating slight density drag before the valve discovery. "Hearten" appears three times, which reads purposeful but risks repetition. The valve "hummed" and "grew warm" track cleanly. Figurative language ("sonic lattice," "ghostly lattice," "ivory harbor after rain") is coherent and supports closure without mixed vehicles. No scaffold or churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—archivist captures memory in sea spray, uses a broken instrument's valve to map communal rhythm—is specific and non-obvious. The pivot from restoration to representation (showing the map rather than the sound) feels earned and transforms the exile/return trope. Risk-taking in the reactive-vision mechanic and staggered-interval method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. "Navigated absences" and the lattice of echoes avoid generic post-disaster template; the story commits fully to the premise. The emotional arc (exile → loss → collective heartening) is particular to this world and character.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara drives all key beats: sorting vials, touching the valve, following its pulse, realizing the trumpet's role, mapping the lattice, gathering the exiles, and activating the vials in sequence. Her reactive gift constrains how she accesses memory (tangible shard required) and enables the closure spectacle. Present in setup, middle development, and closure; decisions alter tactics (pivot from sound to map) with visible cost (trumpet cannot be restored).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The valve appears in four beats: discovery, directional pull across the harbor, final hum and vision shift, and warm stillness in her hand at closure. It constrains Elara's path (she follows its pulse) and charges the final image (warm and still, signaling completion). Its bent, tarnished state and the crushed bell it seeks create visible cost. Irreplaceable: only this valve calibrates the vials and maps the intervals.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" frames the opening stake (a world of voids) and returns as "a map of navigated absences, given form" at closure, reweighting the void as a diagram rather than loss. It shapes Elara's task (compile fragments) and the exiles' final understanding (emptiness as structure). Present in setup and closure; middle beats enact it (following gaps, mapping points) without labeling. Conceptual cost: they accept the absence of literal restoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" constrains Elara's access to memory (requires tangible shard) and enables the valve's directional pull and the vial-triggered visions. Present in setup, active in middle beats (flashes at each harbor point), and implicit at closure (the vials release echoes). Cost: she cannot see the past without physical keys, and the crushed bell limits what she can restore. Label-only mention in opening paragraph trends lower; enacted constraint in valve-pulse beats lifts score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Hearten" is the pivot choice: Elara shifts from restoring sound to showing the exiles their mapped harmony. Signaled early ("hearten the people by showing them the map"), enacted at closure (the gathered spectacle raises "a resilient cheer"), and irreplaceable—other verbs (comfort, encourage) lack the specific communal-uplift connotation. The final image ("her own heart eased") closes the arc. Present in setup, development (decision to map), and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" structures the valve-pulse sequence (move, wait, resonance guides next point) and the final vial activation (released in sequence through intervals). Signaled in the middle ("through staggered intervals, following the valve's pulse") and enacted at closure ("activated her vials in sequence, through staggered intervals"). Mechanics matter: irregular timing reveals the trumpet's celestial/tidal alignment. Irreplaceable: regular intervals would not reconstruct the living schedule. Present in development and closure; slight late signal (after 40% mark) caps upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's rain-slicked stone, derelict signal tower, wet shale, and main quay ground all beats. The crushed bell under masonry constrains Elara's choice (no literal restoration). The harbor's emptiness and the valve's warm guidance pressure the path. Present in setup, development, and closure. The harbor after rain charges the final image ("illuminate the ivory harbor after rain"). Setting shapes tactics (she follows the valve across specific landmarks) and supplies the closure stage (main quay gathering).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" frames the opening ("The exile was over") and closes ("The exile was truly over"). It creates the dominant stake (rebuild from loss) and the communal audience (returned exiles). Present in setup and closure, but middle beats do not track time pressure or tighten a clock. The timeframe enables the story but does not constrain on-page choices with urgency. Conceptual cost: they accept the post-exile void as permanent structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is Elara's stated compulsion (opening), drives her sorting and valve-following (middle), and resolves at closure when the mapped echoes become shared meaning ("compiled its fragments into meaning"). Friction: the crushed bell forces her to compile representation rather than sound. Present in setup, development (each vial flash compiles a fragment), and closure. Cost: she cannot restore literal harmony, only its diagram.</comment>
