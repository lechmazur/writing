<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "uncover truth in the tension" is clear, but her agency within the memory-trap feels passive until the lagoon sequence. The core choice—focusing light on the lock—arrives late and lacks visible internal conflict or trade-off. Embodied emotion is thin; "her hand instinctively clutching at her chest" and "her gaze steady" are gestural clichés that flatten the stakes of carrying brutal truth into the world. The "solemn woman" and "her real work was just beginning" slide into summary assertion rather than earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Elara escapes the retrocognitive trap by discovering the encrypted diary, gaining the brutal truth that breaks the loop—a Decisive Change with felt cost (she must now carry and voice suppressed histories). The causal chain holds under a Causal lens: memory-world pull → lagoon → diary → vision → release. Orientation is clear early (zeppelin chamber, three days post-explosion, catatonic body in med bay). One meaningful tightening occurs when the memory reforms at the lagoon, narrowing her path to the encrypted case. Minor cost-proof issue: the "phantom weight" and resolve to "rebuild" feel asserted rather than dramatized with visible friction or forfeiture in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating library, obsidian lagoon, and black sand shore are vivid and purposeful, grounding the psychic landscape. The lagoon's "dark, liquid eye" and "obsidian surface" recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (zeppelin deck → lagoon shore → wading in). The shard of memory-glass constrains the climactic choice (focusing light to open the lock), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("acrid and eternal," "cool and silent"), though the sterile medical bay at the end is generic and underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: escape the psychic prison by uncovering the truth behind the letters. Pressure escalates through one meaningful tightening—the memory-world's wind-pull directive forces Elara to the lagoon, narrowing her options. The climactic agency (using the glass shard to unlock the diary) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the looping reverie with visible cost: she must now carry and voice the "brutal, unencumbered truth." Thelock-puzzle moment could show more internal resistance or trade-off to reach the 8+ band, but the cost is legible in the final paragraph's resolve and phantom weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus sanitized history, and the archivist's duty to voice suppressed voices—emerges through concrete particulars: the hopeful letters as decoy, the encrypted diary's crystalline pages, the vision of secret police and vanished protesters. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "The truth, once uncovered, demanded to be heard, and she was its only conduit." The contrast between "sanitized hope and the violence that had followed" is dramatized rather than asserted. Minor slip: "her real work was just beginning" edges toward platform declaration, but the image of rising to rebuild anchors it in embodied resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("acrid and eternal," "phantom wind," "searing reverie"), filtering setting through Elara's archival and traumatized lens. Psychic distance is consistent, tightening under pressure (lock puzzle, vision). Minor register drift: "retrocognitively trapped," "parley," "Resonant Reconfiguration" (not in text, but "obliquely referenced" and "encrypted diary discovery" carry academic polish that slightly exceeds urgent interiority). The prose modulates well from haunted stillness to desperate action, though "solemn woman" and "her gaze steady" are externalized clichés that weaken the final beat's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high (memory-trap premise, letters/diary split, lock mechanism, vision payload delivered efficiently). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the lock and vision beats. Minor scaffold issues: "This was her purgatory" and "This was the core of the mystery" use identical stems; "The memory shifted, as it always did" and "The memory-world answered" recycle "memory" as anchor without varying syntax. "Searing" appears twice (reverie, hiss), a small echo. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("liquid eye staring back," "phantom weight"), with no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop near the end: "The archivist had escaped the loop, but the solemn woman knew her real work was just beginning" restates closure cost already shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap and encrypted-diary premise offer a fresh synthesis of psychic thriller and archival mystery. The memory-as-place mechanic (arranging debris to parley, focusing light through memory-glass) is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on the particular split between hopeful letters and brutal diary, not just generic "hidden truth." Risk-taking is present (the looping reverie structure, the vision-as-vision climax), though the "waking in the med bay" beat is a familiar return-to-reality frame. The lagoon and crystalline diary pages bring verifiable, image-specific detail that avoids stock dystopian or psychic-trap templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout. Her key choices—parlaying with the memory-world via debris messages, focusing the glass shard to unlock the diary—drive the middle and closure beats. She is named early and her archival role colors perception. The "solemn" descriptor is static and the final decision to "rebuild" is asserted rather than shown as a contested micro-choice, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in three beats: initial sighting from the zeppelin, the memory reformation at its shore, and the wading-in moment where Elara retrieves the case. It is signaled early (first third), constrains the middle turn (the directive pull), and is present in the closure sequence. Its specific properties (dark, light-swallowing, mythic) charge the final image of truth hidden beneath. Swappability is low; the lagoon's obsidian nature and the "liquid eye" image are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is the object Elara retrieves and unlocks, driving the vision that breaks the memory-trap. It is set up obliquely ("the letters were found… the explosion tore the sky") and appears concretely in the second half (lagoon case, lock puzzle, crystalline pages). It shapes the climactic beat and the closure stakes (carrying the brutal truth). Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure), but late first concrete mention and the encryption mechanism is solved in one move without prior failed attempts or visible cost tied to the unlocking itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" frames the entire narrative and constrains every beat: Elara cannot escape by will alone, must parley with the memory, and can only break free by discovering the heavier truth. The trait is named early, enables the debris-message method, and the cost (looping reverie, catatonic body) is visible. The vision finale is the on-page payoff. It is indispensable; remove it and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Parley" is named once and demonstrated in one beat: arranging debris to spell "WHY?" and receiving the wind-pull directive. It shapes a middle turn but is not present in the closure sequence (unlocking the diary is a different action). The method is specific but used in only one beat and does not recur or reweight at the end, capping it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is the method Elara uses to communicate with the memory-world in one beat. It is described ("fallen books, twisted metal, shards of stained glass… charcoal: WHY?") and drives the wind-pull response. But it appears only in the middle, does not return at closure, and the lock is solved via the glass shard (a different mechanic). Functional but not indispensable; swappable with another communication method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating library on the zeppelin is the opening anchor, provides the "singed observation deck" where Elara arranges debris, and supplies the memory-glass shard she uses to unlock the diary. Present in setup and payoff, it enables a key tool. But the library itself does not pressure a choice or constrain tactics beyond providing the shard; the lagoon and diary dominate the closure. It is causally linked but not charged in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Three days prior" anchors the inciting event (letters found, explosion) and "the moment… when the letters were found" establishes the loop's temporal anchor. But no live clock tightens decisions within the present narrative; the timeframe is backstory context rather than a pressure on Elara's choices in the memory. Present but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to uncover truth in the tension between the letters' sanitized hope and the violence that had followed" is stated early and drives the lagoon descent and diary unlock. The vision of "secret police, vanished protesters, engineered silences" dramatizes the payoff. The friction between hopeful decoy and brutal truth shapes the ending's weight. But the internal conflict (wanting escape versus needing truth) is asserted more than shown through contradictory impulses in action, and the final resolve to "rebuild" is told rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is present from the opening ("acrid and eternal," "consciousness was seared into this looping reverie") and recurs at the vision climax ("a searing hiss," "searing reverie of loss and defiance"). Tone modulates from haunted stillness (floating library, phantom wind) to desperate urgency (wading, unlocking) to charged resolve (rising to rebuild). The final image—"phantom weight… her gaze steady"—completes the tonal arc from trap to costly freedom. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
