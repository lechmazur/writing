<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices under pressure. Her "gently thorough" nature is labeled repeatedly but never constrains an action with visible cost. The locket-warming moment offers a supernatural shift, but her response is passive observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from archivist to witness without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, when by ~50 words). However, the closure unit is unclear: the "regenerated covenant" and merging past/present are asserted through narration rather than enacted through a decisive change with on-page cost. The final paragraph recycles prior claims ("haunted euphoria," "gently thorough," "through proximate causes") in a summary loop rather than landing a resonant reconfiguration. Under an Accumulative lens (inferred from the repetitive motifs and atmospheric focus), the ending needed a cadence shift or image that reweighted the stakes; instead it restates them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vividly rendered with jasmine glow and twilight detail, and the setting appears in both opening and closing images. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's action; she documents the glow but the jetty remains a backdrop. The locket and walnut ink are handled objects, but neither pressures tactics at a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving small moments—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; the supernatural glow appears and she documents it without complication. The "regenerated covenant" is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is absent: Elara observes and records but does not decide under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly in multiple passages: "the weight of small moments," "haunted euphoria," "regenerated covenant." The final paragraph lists these labels rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece offers no counter-reading or moral ambiguity; preservation is valorized without friction. Epiphanies are asserted ("she understood that her archives were not just records, but catalysts") rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but the prose recycles prompt phrases ("gently thorough," "through proximate causes," "haunted euphoria") as authorial glosses rather than character-specific perception. Perceptual signature is weak: Elara's way of noticing is not selective or biased; she observes the glow with the same even register as the jasmine. Psychic distance collapses into exposition in the final third, telling the reader what the covenant means rather than dramatizing its effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops pervade the text: paragraphs 3–5 restate Elara's method three times without advancing knowledge. The final paragraph is a 90-word summary that cycles through prompt elements ("steeped in memory," "through proximate causes," "when context changes," "gently thorough," "haunted euphoria") in template cadence. Figurative language is sparse but clean where present. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same thematic claim. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and scaffold, especially touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The magical-realism archivist premise echoes familiar "memory as magic" templates without transformation. Prompt elements are integrated mechanically: "walnut ink," "proximate causes," "regenerated covenant" appear as labels rather than irreplaceable specifics. The locket photo that updates with the present is the story's freshest inflection, but it arrives late and Elara's response lacks surprise or cost. No bold risk or synthesis; the piece executes a premise checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archival work frames the scene, but she makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. She observes the glow, opens the locket, and continues documenting—all passive reception. Her choice to "continue" and "vow to continue" in the final third restates her initial motivation without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in three beats: introduced (paragraph 6), opens and shimmers (paragraph 14), and shows both sisters at the end (paragraph 29). It signals early and returns with reweighted meaning (merging past/present), but Elara does not handle it in a way that narrows options or enables a tactic under pressure. The object's transformation is asserted rather than dramatized through choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "regenerated covenant" is named four times (paragraphs 17, 18, 19, 28) but only as thematic narration. It does not shape an on-page stake or constrain a tactic; Elara does not face a choice between honoring or breaking the covenant. The concept is told rather than enacted, and it resolves nothing because no conflict tests it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is labeled five times across the story but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Paragraph 4 states "each stroke of her brush deliberate and caring," but no turn hinges on this trait. The attribute is ornamental; a rushed or careless archivist would not alter the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Steeping" appears in three passages (paragraphs 8, 9, 27) and is defined as letting memories "soak into her consciousness like tea." It frames her reflective process but does not drive a turn. The action is present and thematically consistent, yet swappable with "reflecting" or "immersing" without structural loss. Mid-band for functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is named four times and defined as tracing effects to immediate sources (paragraph 11). Elara uses this method to understand the glow's triggers (paragraphs 11, 24, 32), but the method does not constrain or shape her attempts. It is present in the final sentence but as a label rather than a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is introduced in the opening line, appears in the locket photo transformation (paragraph 15), and frames the closing image (paragraphs 33, 37). It supplies the visual motif that charges the final image and the glow phenomenon is unique to this setting. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara's actions would be the same on any magical threshold. Strong setup and closure linkage lift it into the 6-band despite limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When context changes" is named twice (paragraphs 10, 16) and the story tracks the twilight-to-night transition across multiple beats. Time is legible but does not tighten decisions; Elara works at her own pace and the darkness does not impose a deadline or complicate her task. Functional but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is stated in paragraph 3 and echoed in paragraphs 34 and 38. The motivation is told rather than dramatized; no beat shows Elara choosing preservation over a competing desire. Friction between her want and a cost is absent. The motivation frames the premise but does not drive conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named three times (paragraphs 20, 21, 30, 38) and defined as "bittersweet joy tinged with loss and wonder." The tone is asserted through narration rather than modulated through scene pressure. Elara's register remains even across the supernatural turn; no tonal shift charges the final image. Label-only integration.</comment>
