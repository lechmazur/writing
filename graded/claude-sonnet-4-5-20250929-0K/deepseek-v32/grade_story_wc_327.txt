<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller remains a static vessel for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His motivation is declared ("to translate texture into sound") but never tested by competing desires or meaningful renunciation—he simply executes his plan across a vague timespan. The trade-off (losing native words for encoded textures) is told in summary ("each translation cost him a memory") without embodied hesitation or micro-choice that would show interior conflict. The final acceptance ("He accepted this, trading the old for the new") reads as resignation narrated rather than a decision dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece signals who and where early enough, but the drive lens wavers between Causal (he plans, executes) and Accumulative (textural density). The closure—emerging to find his people gone but their textures encoded—lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the cost is asserted ("his people gone, their language utterly extinct") rather than shown; we never see him lose a specific memory or struggle with a particular word on the page. The phrase "For days, or perhaps years—time blurred in the tunnel" collapses causality into summary, and the final image (wind carrying textures, diamond falling inert) offers symbolic completion without a before/after choice that the protagonist makes at that moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and the tunnel of echoes are vividly anchored with specific textures ("gritty texture of bone towers, the smoothness of polished stone"). The flock's avoidance of the crevice guides the protagonist's approach, and the tunnel's "captured whispers" create atmospheric pressure. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—it serves as backdrop for the symbolic transformation rather than a live obstacle that alters his tactics in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve the dying language through textural translation) is clear, but escalation is minimal: he observes birds, enters the tunnel, speaks, succeeds. No on-page reversal narrows his options; the diamond's "curse" (a history of failed ambitions) never manifests as obstacle, and his plan proceeds without friction. The cost (losing memories of native words) is summarized rather than dramatized in a moment where he must choose between a specific word and its translation, so the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (translation, preservation, and the cost of transformation) emerges clearly from the premise and final image. The flawed diamond and the bird patterns function as motifs, but their recurrence is more decorative than charged: the diamond appears inert at the end without prior struggle over its use, and the birds' final wheel feels like bookend symmetry rather than a reweighted image that answers the central question. The ending avoids overt moralizing, yet the assertion "he had given birth to another [language], one of pure sensory truth" tips toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV holds steady, and the phrase "quietly articulate" seeds a distinct narrative register. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("immutable and eternal," "sanctuary of synthesized sensation") that does not reflect the focalizer's embodied urgency. The narrator's perceptual signature is uniform across calm observation and peak transformation, missing the rhythm modulation that pressure would impose. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing image or concept, but multiple passages loop without added pressure: "The death of his language was a slow backdrop" near-duplicates "Across the death of a language, he labored." Template cadence appears in the middle section ("He stood still… Then, he began to speak… He described…"). The phrase "a library of felt noise" and "sanctuary of synthesized sensation" are figurative stacks that obscure rather than sharpen. Clarity remains serviceable, but momentum sags under the weight of synonym churn ("echoes… murmurs… reverberations… cacophony").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of translation, sensory encoding, and bird-pattern navigation offers a non-obvious angle on language-death narratives. The flawed diamond as creative lens rather than mere curse shows transformation of a trope. Yet the core emotional arc—solitary artist preserves dying culture through sacrifice—closely matches familiar templates, and the final image (wind carrying encoded textures, towers singing) leans toward poetic closure that feels anticipated rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout and his choices (observing birds, entering the tunnel, using the diamond) drive the sequence. However, his decisions do not create reversals or alter tactics; he executes a linear plan without friction. His trait (copper veins) is mentioned twice but never constrains or enables an action with cost—it remains decorative descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in three beats: held at the tunnel entrance, flared during translation, and fell inert at the end. Its "curse" is declared but never dramatizes a cost or tradeoff in the middle beats; it functions as a tool whose "peculiar energy" is harnessed without on-page struggle. The final drop signals spent power, a mild reprise, but the object's properties do not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is essential: the protagonist enters it, the air hums with captured whispers, and he directs the echoes with his voice—three distinct beats. The tunnel's unique property (sound becomes almost physical) enables the translation that would fail elsewhere. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is mentioned twice ("his words precise whispers," "his quietly articulate heart") but never constrains or enables an action. The trait does not create a tradeoff—he does not struggle to be heard, nor does his precision cost him speed or emotional connection. It remains a label that colors voice without altering choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Harness" appears explicitly in two major beats: harnessing the echoes according to bird patterns, and harnessing the diamond's cursed energy. The action defines the climax and the method of translation. However, the harnessing succeeds without friction; if replaced with "channel" or "focus," the plot would proceed unchanged, indicating mid-band replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bird patterns are signaled early (observing their swirling dances, deciphering turns and climbs) and return in the final line ("the flock of birds wheeled, their patterns eternally echoing below"). The protagonist uses the patterns to guide echoes in the tunnel, a clear middle beat. However, the mechanics remain vague ("letting the patterns in his mind align"), and the birds' absence would not break causality if he used another mnemonic device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of echoes anchor all major beats: the protagonist moves among them, the birds avoid a crevice in the canyon wall, and the towers "now sang" at closure. The setting supplies the echoes (resource) and the tunnel entrance (access point). However, the environment does not pressure a choice—he navigates it without obstacle, so it functions more as stage than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" frames the story and "each day noting another word forgotten" suggests a ticking clock, but time remains abstract. The phrase "For days, or perhaps years—time blurred" explicitly abandons temporal tracking. At closure, "his people gone, their language utterly extinct" is discovered rather than raced against, so the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To translate texture into sound" is stated early and drives his plan: he describes textures, the echoes coalesce, and the final wind carries those textures as symphony. The motivation shapes beats and closure. However, it is never shown in friction—no moment where the desire to preserve competes with fear of the curse or doubt in the method. The trade-off (losing native words) is told in summary, not dramatized as a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
