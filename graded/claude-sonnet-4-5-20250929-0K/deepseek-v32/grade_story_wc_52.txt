<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and embodied: her hands "seeking" the wood, holding memories "lightly," working with "deliberate channeling of ache into action." The motivation to harvest lessons from loss drives tangible micro-choices—the gouge's path, the hollowing to "make room"—with visible cost (the ghost limb, the chair that would never bear weight). Internal contradiction appears in the paradox "here and gone" that she lives rather than resolves. Minor slip: the phrase "rust-hued peace" reads slightly label-like when first introduced, though it's later grounded in sensory detail ("color of old iron and settled melancholy").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words (loft, skylight, rain, carving, kettle). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marta's final return to the gouge demonstrates endurance with visible cost—the work is "hauntingly practical," a structure to hold grief without drowning. The piece deepens through cadence shift and density increase (rain slows, light changes, tea ritual frames the work), reweighting the stake from raw absence to livable paradox. Cost is legible: "Both truths could exist without tearing her apart" and the image of the carving as "a lid for a void." One persistent constraint (the timeframe of the boiling kettle) shapes the session's rhythm and the final return to work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skylight loft constrains and charges every beat: rain streaks distort sky, steam clouds the kitchen window, wet glass turns to fractured silver as clouds thin. The ash wood's scent and grain are handled tactilely across multiple beats, the carving's emerging shape holding "shadows and potential." The kettle's whistle and the cup of tea anchor the ritual timeframe. The micro-setting (body, tool, and confined space) drives the final image: "fractured silver" light, "ghost of steam," scent of ash, all converging as Marta picks up the gouge again. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through grief-sharpened attention, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding a way to hold grief without being drowned by it. The stake is signaled early ("to harvest lessons from loss") and tightens through agency: Marta's choice to hollow "not with sadness, but to make room," to "contain, not to imprison." The kettle's whistle marks a micro-turn—she sets down the tool, performs the tea ritual, then studies the work with new clarity. The final return to carving is a renunciation of escape, an endurance that forecloses easier paths (forgetting, freezing the past) with visible cost: the ongoing labor, the chair that "would never again bear his weight." Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "here and gone," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace" are enacted through the carving's evolution, the tea ritual, the rain's slowing. The piece resists moralizing; the final image—"slow-forming facets catch the light and cast new patterns"—offers a resonant answer to how to live with permanent loss without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in gesture (holding memory "lightly," setting the tool down "beside the half-born form") and image (the draped curve, negative space where a body leaned). The closing line "one deliberate shaving at a time" reprices the project as ongoing discipline rather than completion, with conceptual cost implicit in the infinitude of the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean psychic distance; narrative certainty matches Marta's knowledge and perception. Diction is distinct and consistent: "ghost limb," "rust-hued peace," "sediment of years," "safe container of memory." Perceptual signature is strong—she notices grain, scent, light through grief's lens. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during reflection ("The concept was the breath of her days now: he was here and gone..."), shorter declaratives at closure ("The wood waited, and she continued"). Minor note: "hauntingly practical" appears twice in close proximity as a descriptor, slightly reducing lexical variety, though it functions as a charged motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, character, or thematic charge. Rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the meditative tone without falling into template cadence. Figurative language is concentrated but mostly coherent: "silence was a new animal," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace." One mixed vehicle: "the ghost of steam" feels tonally mismatched with the grounded physicality elsewhere—steam dissipates, ghosts linger, the combination muddles slightly. Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops. The line "hauntingly practical" recurs verbatim twice within close range, a small lexical echo. Overall propulsion is steady, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—widow carving grief into physical form—risks familiarity, but specificity transforms it: ash wood (not generic timber), lion tamer's absence (not generic spouse), "crystallized time" as method, the kettle's timeframe. The "here and gone" paradox and "rust-hued peace" offer fresh inflections on grief work. The choice to carve abstract curves rather than lions is a non-obvious angle that deepens theme. The final image of facets casting new patterns feels earned in hindsight. Slight derivative pressure from the craft-as-therapy template, but the lived detail (scent of ash, draped curve, negative space) and the piece's refusal of resolution elevate it above the baseline.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta is present throughout; her choices drive every beat—picking up the gouge, hollowing the channel, setting the tool down, studying the work, returning to carve. Signaled immediately ("Marta's world"), her widowhood anchors motivation and all micro-choices. The carving action and final return are agent-driven decisions that alter tactics (containment rather than forgetting). Present in setup, development (tea ritual, studying the work), and closure (picking up the gouge again). Cost is visible: the ongoing labor, the ghost limb, the chair. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ash wood blank appears in paragraph one, is handled in paragraph two (gouge work, emerging form), paragraph four (deep channel, curling shavings, scent), paragraph five (half-born form, studied in diffused light), and paragraphs six and seven (the carving's future shape, waiting for the next session, final line). Across five distinct beats it evolves from blank to "half-born form" to "tool for living." Its grain, scent, and emerging curves constrain and enable Marta's choices. Charged in the final image ("the wood waited"). Setup early, developed mid-scene, integral to closure. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is stated in paragraph two and enacted throughout: Leo is "a presence, a ghost limb," the carving holds "shadows and potential," the memory is "sharp, yet she held it lightly." The final paragraph crystallizes the concept: "Both truths could exist without tearing her apart." It shapes stakes (how to hold paradox) and tactics (to contain without imprisoning). Present in setup (paragraph two), developed (memory of Leo reading), and charged at closure (facets catching light, ongoing work). The concept redefines options from binary (remember or forget) to paradox management. Strong closure linkage and causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears twice: paragraph two ("her movement hauntingly practical") and paragraph five ("hauntingly practical, this alchemy of turning pain into a tangible thing"). It constrains action—her discipline is both spectral (haunted by Leo) and functional (ache channeled into carving). The trait enables the tea ritual and the choice to build "a structure sturdy enough to hold" grief. Visible tradeoff: practicality requires ongoing labor, foreclosing easier emotional exits. Present in setup, enacted in middle beats, referenced at closure. Solid causal role, though the double mention slightly reduces specificity impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Contain" is the engine of the piece: "to contain the essence," "to contain, not to imprison," "give the immense feeling a finite, beautiful vessel so it would not drown her," "a lid for a void," "a safe container of her memory." It appears across paragraphs two, four, five, and six, driving the hollowing action, the tea ritual (containing hot water), and the final understanding of the carving's purpose. The action redefines options from erasure/freezing to active holding. Major turns (hollowing the channel, studying the half-born form, returning to carve) all trace to containment. Irreplaceable; swapping it would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" is stated in paragraph two: "Her method was through crystallized time. She wasn't carving a moment, but the sediment of years." It's echoed in the final paragraph: "to crystallize the time they had, not to freeze it dead, but to let its slow-forming facets catch the light." The method shapes her approach (carving sediment, not likeness) and is referenced at closure (facets). However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how exactly she enacts "crystallizing" beyond carving is implied rather than dramatized. Present in setup and closure; less visible in middle development. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, justifying mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in the opening line and pressures every beat: rain sets mood and timeframe, the skylight distorts the pewter sky, steam clouds the window, the glass brightens as clouds thin. The setting's enclosure ("quiet capsule suspended") mirrors Marta's containment project. The skylight's changing light charges the final image ("fractured silver," "new patterns on the wall"). The loft supplies resources (stove, kettle, workspace) and constrains action to a single compressed scene. Present in setup, developed throughout (rain, steam, light shifts), integral to closure. High causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the kettle boils" is stated in paragraph one and tracked: kettle's "low whisper," "murmur climbed in pitch," whistle "pierced the air." The clock tightens the work session, marks the micro-turn (set tool down, make tea), and frames the return to carving. However, the timeframe is somewhat elastic—Marta's reflection and the scope of carving accomplished feel generous for a kettle's boil (~5–7 minutes). Present in setup and closure (waiting for "the next boiling kettle"), shapes one key turn (the tea ritual). Solid but not maximally tight; the live clock alters moves but doesn't squeeze options as hard as it might.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is stated in paragraph one and dramatized throughout: choosing the gouge's path, hollowing to make room, holding memory lightly, building a structure to hold grief. Friction appears between desire (to keep Leo close) and cost (ongoing labor, the chair's emptiness). The motivation drives every choice and is charged at closure: the carving as "tool for living," the return to work "one deliberate shaving at a time." Present in setup, development (tea ritual as part of the harvest), and closure. The want is layered (not to forget, but also not to drown), creating authentic tension. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is introduced in paragraph two ("the color of old iron and settled melancholy, warm and weathered and strong"), modulates through the rain and steam imagery, and charges the final paragraph: "The peace was rust-hued, earned through weathering, and it was enough." The tone coheres through turns—meditative but not static, warm yet melancholic—and intensifies as the piece accumulates. The closing image (fractured silver light, scent of ash, quiet afternoon) embodies the tone. Present in setup, sustained through development, decisive at closure. The tone reweights the stake from raw grief to livable endurance. Strong closure charge and coherence.</comment>
