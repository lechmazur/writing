<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" remains abstract throughout; her interior is labeled rather than embodied ("gravity defier," "woman who moved through the world unbound by weight"). The climactic mirror encounter tells us she "must accept the fracture" without showing contradictory impulses acting in scene—she simply reaches out and integrates with no visible cost or struggle. Embodied emotion is absent at peak beats; we get conceptual summary ("not as a burden, but as a symphony of selves") instead of felt pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—"tomb outside of time," "state of being periodically eternal" remain vague anchors—triggering a −0.4 penalty. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (integration of fractured selves), but cost is asserted rather than shown: the tablet goes blank, the labyrinth dissolves, and Aria "felt whole" without on-page forfeit or alteration of tactics. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (gathering fractured timeline imagery toward integration), but the final beat delivers summary rather than a charged image with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The viaduct is vividly rendered ("stones shimmering with captured rainwater," "radiance deepened into ominous gold"), and the glowing-after-rain attribute appears early and late. However, spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is generic ("walls shifted and reformed," "corridors," "circular chamber") without constraining choice—Aria floats over obstacles without spatial consequence. The tablet and mirror function as props but do not shape tactics; the viaduct itself does not pressure a decision at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early, but escalation is simulated rather than earned: obstacles ("walls of thorny light," "floors of liquid shadow") appear and are bypassed via gravity defiance with no visible cost or tactic change. The climax—touching the mirror—happens without a preceding choice that narrows options; timelines "flow into her" passively. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a path; the resolution is delivered rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges (fractured selves, integration vs. conquest) through imagery of timelines and mirror, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "she was the drop, and every life she lived was the ripple" and "conquered not by destruction, but by understanding" are stated rather than enacted. The tablet-rune message spells the truth on the page, replacing scene pressure with expository revelation. The mirror coalescence offers symbolic potential but dissolves into abstraction without concrete emotional cost tying the ending to prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aria with consistent psychic distance. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("coalescence of all her possibilities," "symphony of selves," "periodically eternal cycle broken by integration") that reads more like prompt-echo than character perception. Perceptual signature is weak—Aria's way of noticing remains generic across emotional states. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The labyrinth dissolved around her, its periodically eternal cycle broken by integration" immediately follows resolution of the mirror touch with no new information (−0.3). Template cadence runs appear in the labyrinth sequence: "In one, she was…; in another, she…" repeats without variation (−0.4). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angles: "darkening brightness," "corridors of thorny light," "liquid shadow" (−0.3). Figurative language in most sentences of the climax ("symphony of selves," "flow into her") lacks coherent vehicle and elevates register beyond the POV's established texture (−0.5). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.5 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—navigating a procedurally generated labyrinth of fractured selves—echoes familiar metaphysical-journey templates without transformation through lived detail or fresh moral calculus (−1.0 derivative-premise adjustment). "Procedural generation" as a method reads as game-design jargon imported without dramatization. The mirror-integration ending is conventional for this archetype; no bold risk or synthesis emerges. Gravity defiance remains a label without pressure-testing its limits or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria (gravity defier) appears throughout but her gravity-defying ability is described rather than used to create key turns—she "floated over" obstacles without decision or cost. The climactic choice is reaching out to touch the mirror, which any character could do; her specific trait does not drive it. Mid-band: functionally present but largely swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clay tablet with runes appears in beat one (discovery mentioned), is held aloft to pulse with light and fracture the air (opening the labyrinth), serves as compass ("runes rearranging to map"), grows warmer to guide, vibrates and floats runes into the air to spell truth, then goes blank at closure. Three distinct beats with evolving use, but the tablet enables rather than constrains—no visible cost tied to its mechanics. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, but swappable magical-compass role −0.6, no cost linkage −0.4. Lands mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines (core concept) frame the labyrinth's structure and populate corridor visions ("warrior-queen," "silent scholar"), appearing early and at closure. However, the concept operates as theme and backdrop rather than shaping on-page tactics or altering options—Aria walks through visions but does not choose among them with cost. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental development −0.8, no causal pressure −1.0. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" (attribute) is stated early ("existed in a state of being periodically eternal, cycling through moments of creation and stasis") and mentioned at closure ("its periodically eternal cycle broken"). Label-only; does not constrain action or impose visible cost. Setup +0.5, closure mention +0.3, label-only −0.7, no tradeoff −0.8, swappable −0.6. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" (action) appears in motivation ("must retrace every step of her divergent paths") and is invoked again mid-story ("had to walk backward through the consequences of a single choice"). However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized in distinct beats—we do not see her reverse a specific sequence with cost, only told she must. Setup +0.5, mentioned in middle +0.4, summary-only −0.7, swappable with "revisit" or "follow" −0.6. Mid-low functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Through procedural generation" (method) is named twice ("procedural generation, where the labyrinth built itself anew," "the procedural generation of her psyche") but never shown—we do not see the algorithm or mechanics in action, only shifting walls described generically. Label-only mention without causal work or cost. Setup +0.5, label-only −0.9, no beat involvement −0.8, ornamental −0.7. Ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain opens and closes the piece, bracketing the journey with vivid sensory detail ("stones shimmering with captured rainwater," "calm, steady luminescence"). It serves as threshold but does not pressure a choice—Aria steps off into the labyrinth and returns without the viaduct altering tactics. Early signal +0.7, closure reprise +0.9, lyric bracket reweights the ending image +0.5, but no causal pressure −0.8, postcard role −0.6, no cost linkage −0.5. Lyric-resonance allowance lifts it into low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" (timeframe) appears early and at closure ("the hushed timeframe between the drop and the ripple," "the moment before the ripple and after the drop"). Metaphorical rather than literal clock; does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time with cost. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.7, metaphoric not mechanical −0.9, no tactical constraint −0.8, swappable with any suspended-moment phrase −0.6. Functional but vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To conquer the labyrinth of self" (motivation) is stated in paragraph four and drives the quest structure through to closure ("her inner labyrinth conquered"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses—Aria pursues integration without visible friction between wants and costs until the endpoint is delivered. Early signal +0.7, three beats (entrance, mirror, closure) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only desire −1.2, no on-page friction or cost −0.8. Mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" (tone) is established early ("tone of the evening was one of darkening brightness") and modulates through the sequence ("radiance deepened into ominous gold," "brilliant whites and deep blacks swirled together chaotically," "darkening brightness lifted"). The tone is stated explicitly rather than embodied in sentence rhythm or image alone, but it does track pressure and charges the final calm image. Early signal +0.7, three beats +0.9, closure participation (lifted tone) +1.0, but explicitly labeled rather than evoked −0.6, static mood in middle −0.5. Low-to-mid 6s.</comment>
