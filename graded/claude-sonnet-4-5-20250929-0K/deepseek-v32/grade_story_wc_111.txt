<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistently present but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on summary ("her motivation was steadfast") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The villager encounter offers one moment of pressure, but Elara's response is serene and confident throughout, missing the genuine struggle that would earn her final stance. Emotional progression is muted; no mistakes compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (villager understanding + Elara's commemoration) with felt social cost visible in the villager abandoning his meter. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. However, causality is loose: the maze's response to Elara's care is asserted repeatedly but never tested or threatened on the page, so the villager's reversal feels granted rather than earned through a dramatic turn. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the final image reweights the marble collection, but one meaningful tightening is missing—pressure accumulates through description rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden maze provides recurring spatial grounding and the marbles charge the final image through their cracked, polished state. Sensory detail is selective (rustling leaves, shimmering fissures, gold veins) and filtered through Elara's professional attention. However, the maze itself does not constrain a key choice—Elara navigates it freely, and the villager's path is guided rather than tested by the environment. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting remains illustrative rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. The villager's skepticism deflates immediately when the luck-meter confirms Elara's claim; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Agency is present in Elara's decision to show the vine and polish a new marble, but these actions face no resistance and carry no visible trade-off. The cost is conceptual (the villager's paradigm shift) but not felt in Elara's struggle, so escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the marble collection and the contrast between luck and labor. The final image of the villager abandoning his meter offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece leans toward assertion ("gardens know their gardeners" is stated multiple times) rather than allowing the theme to arise purely from particulars. The "mended deception" backstory enriches theme but is told rather than dramatized, reducing resonance. Subtext operates in the marbles' cracks and the maze's whisper, elevating the work above generic treatment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's gardener's attention to vines and blossoms, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament," "dialogue between tender and tended") that feels more literary than character-rooted. The villager's brief dialogue is serviceable but lacks distinct idiom. Narrative distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression in the opening works, but syntactic patterns recur ("she polished," "she placed," "she showed") creating minor template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The garden knows me" / "gardens know their gardeners" / "the garden's recognition" restates the core idea across multiple beats without added pressure. Sentence openings recycle ("Elara [verb]," "She [verb]," "The [noun]") across high-frequency spans, creating rhythmic monotony. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she recalled," "she saw") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Information density is moderate; several sentences advance atmosphere without tightening conflict. No figurative muddle, and the final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—quantified luck versus gardener's craft—offers a fresh angle, and the marble collection as a record of victories is specific. However, the emotional arc and plot structure follow a familiar template: skeptic arrives, evidence is presented, skeptic converts. The "mended deception" backstory adds complexity but is summarized rather than transformed through scene work. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from bold risk; Elara faces no genuine failure or loss on the page, and the villager's conversion is frictionless. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies moderately; transformation is present but partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara appears early, makes the decision to lead the villager to the central vine, and polishes marbles in multiple beats. Her choices shape the villager's understanding and the final closure. However, her actions face no resistance—she navigates the maze freely, and the garden's response is consistently affirmative—so the character's decisions alter tactics minimally. Present in setup, development, and payoff, with causal involvement in at least two beats and closure linkage, but cost is conceptual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cracked marbles are introduced early, polished in at least two distinct beats (the gold-veined marble, the new marble for the villager's understanding), and placed on the pedestal in the final image. They carry specific meaning (each crack tells a story of near loss) and their accumulation reweights the closure. However, they do not constrain a choice under pressure; Elara selects and polishes them without difficulty. Strong setup, development, and payoff with closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mended deception is recounted in backstory: Elara lied, then confessed. It shapes her past and is symbolized by the gold-veined marble, but it does not alter on-page tactics or create friction in the present scene. The concept is thematically present but not dramatized. Setup is present via backstory; payoff occurs through the marble; development is missing. The element could be removed without breaking the villager encounter or the final closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is labeled in the opening and narration, and Elara's ledger-keeping and calm demonstration reflect the trait. However, it does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost—Elara's pragmatism is rewarded without struggle. The trait is consistent but ornamental. Present in setup and closure (she remains pragmatic at the end), but middle development shows no trade-off where pragmatism forces a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Polishing appears in at least three beats: the gold-veined marble, the meditation on fragility, and the new marble for the villager's understanding. The action is tied to Elara's ritual and charges the final image. However, the polishing does not drive a major turn—it is commemorative rather than transformative. Setup, development, and payoff are present, with closure linkage, but the action is swappable with another ritual gesture (e.g., placing unpolished stones) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories elaborately is signaled early and demonstrated through the marble ritual and ledger documentation. The method shapes Elara's daily practice and appears in the ending when she polishes a new marble. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—it is a background routine. Setup and payoff are present; development is thin. The villager's understanding hinges on seeing the maze, not the commemoration itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The garden maze is introduced early, provides spatial grounding across beats, and houses the central vine that convinces the villager. The maze's paths and the ancient vine are essential to the demonstration. However, the maze does not constrain Elara's choices—she navigates freely, and no tactical difficulty arises from the labyrinth structure. Setup, development, and payoff are strong, with closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate; the maze could be simplified to a single garden plot without breaking the logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after luck becomes measurable" is established in the opening and motivates the villager's arrival with a luck-meter. It provides world context and thematic contrast. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—Elara's work proceeds at her own pace, and the villager's test is instantaneous. Setup is present; development and payoff are weak. The element could be replaced with "in a skeptical village" without altering the scene structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove gardens know their gardeners is stated early and drives her demonstration to the villager. The motivation is consistent and shapes her choice to lead him to the central vine. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Elara never doubts, and no friction arises between her desire and an obstacle. Setup and payoff are present; development lacks on-page struggle. The motivation is functional but could be more deeply embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tone "blooming withering" is signaled in the opening description and recurs in images of decay and growth (withered vine, rare flowers, cracked marbles). The tone modulates subtly across beats and charges the final image of the gleaming marbles and the maze's dual state. However, the tone is more thematic descriptor than pressure modulator—it does not shift in response to escalation or crystallize at closure. Setup and payoff are present; development is atmospheric rather than dynamic.</comment>
