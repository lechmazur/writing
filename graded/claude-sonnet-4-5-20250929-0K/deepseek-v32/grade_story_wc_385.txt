<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to learn why some people echo") is stated early but remains abstract; her perceptive nature is labeled rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied choices. The decision to release Kael's echo arrives without internal conflict—no visible cost of letting go versus preserving. The whispering seashell and "richly perceptive" trait function as props rather than constraints that force trade-offs. Interiority relies on tell ("heavy with the weight of unheard stories") instead of concrete sensory contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue ("progressive disclosure") toward a thematic reweighting at closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "serpentine nexus" remains spatially vague. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—"people echo when their stories are unfinished"—but the cost is asserted ("she had to let his echo fade") rather than dramatized as a visible forfeiture. The final image ("echo…of peace") lands thematically but without demonstrable on-page sacrifice or a before/after legible through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setting is named ("serpentine nexus," "canyon," "starlight") but remains postcard: no spatial choreography, no micro-terrain that alters Elara's path or tactics. The seashell half is held and grows warm but never constrains a choice. "Reed-blown melancholy" is atmospheric mood, not a physical pressure. The environment does not shape the closure image; Elara's walk and song could occur in any liminal space without structural change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn why people echo—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off. Elara hears Kael's echo and follows clues without obstacle or opposition; each fragment arrives on cue. The decision to release his echo is unmotivated by prior pressure: no cost of preserving versus freeing, no tactical narrowing. "Progressive disclosure" accumulates information but does not escalate dilemma. The final act (singing and releasing) is asserted outcome, not a choice that forecloses a visible path under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—unfinished stories echo until resolved—emerges clearly and is woven through imagery (webs, fragments, starlight). The closure offers a resonant answer: echoes seek listeners and completion. However, the final paragraph moralizes with near-prompt language ("people echo when their stories are unfinished, their emotions unresolved"), undercutting subtextual discovery. The seashell recurs but its symbolic role is announced rather than enacted. A stronger embodied final image would lift this into the 6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans toward generic lyricism ("starlight pierced the darkness like needles," "reed-blown melancholy"). Register occasionally drifts into essay mode ("These webs were not of silk but of sound"). No dialogue on the page to assess. Perceptual signature is muted: Elara's noticing remains auditory-thematic without idiosyncratic filtering or rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "She often wondered if her own voice would echo someday, and what it would say" recycles theme without advancing it; "people echo when their stories are unfinished" appears twice in adjacent beats. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She sang…," "She understood…," "She carried…," "And while the universe hummed, she ensured…" Filter verbs cluster mid-passage ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt"). Metaphor strings ("veins under the skin," "needles," "reed-blown") stack without integration. Final paragraph summarizes rather than enacts closure, losing propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—echo singer who hears and releases trapped voices—operates within familiar liminal-space/memory-keeper templates without fresh transformation. "Webs of intrigue" and "progressive disclosure" are named but not dramatized through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The seashell half and "universe's secret song" function as ambient texture rather than irreplaceable constraints. Kael's backstory ("loved too deeply, his voice immortalized by regret") is told in generic terms. The final insight is prompt-adjacent abstraction, not a particular synthesis earned through character pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her investigation structures the narrative. However, her choices are reactive and do not create turns: she hears, follows, learns, and releases without obstacle or internal conflict. The decision to free Kael's echo is stated outcome rather than dramatized agency with visible cost. No on-page moment where a choice narrows options or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and ending but swappable with a generic seeker role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in three beats: given by the old keeper, murmurs clues mid-journey, and grows warm at the final revelation. However, its function is purely expository—it whispers answers rather than constraining Elara's tactics or imposing a trade-off. Never handled with cost; its properties remain ornamental. Present across the arc but replaceable with any divinatory token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" are mentioned four times but never dramatized on the page. The text tells us they are "woven by the echoing ones" and "not accidental but crafted," yet no mechanism or choice-point demonstrates their pressure. Kael's echo is "trapped, tangled in the webs," but Elara's song unravels them without obstacle. Present as thematic claim, absent as narrative constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is labeled in paragraph three and invoked once mid-story ("Using her perceptive nature, she followed the sound"). No on-page moment where heightened perception enables a discovery unavailable to others, nor any cost of over-sensitivity. The trait could be removed with minimal rewrites; Elara's investigation proceeds via the seashell's exposition, not her perceptual acuity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears five times, anchoring Elara's duty: "to ensure that the nexus remained a bridge, not a prison" and "to ensure his release." The final turn—"to ensure his peace, Elara had to let his echo fade"—links the action to closure. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested: what happens if she does not ensure, and what does ensuring cost her? Present in setup and ending, shapes one key turn, but the cost remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named explicitly ("Through progressive disclosure, Elara pieced together the patterns") and structures the middle: fragments of Kael's fate arrive in sequence. The method is signaled and used across beats, but it does not impose cost or constraint—each clue arrives passively. No moment where the disclosure method itself creates tension or alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with "incremental discovery."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Serpentine nexus under starlight" is named in the opening and closing, framing the story. However, the setting remains abstract: no canyon-specific terrain, no starlight-dependent timing, no serpentine path that complicates Elara's movement. The nexus functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Lyric reprise at closure, but the setting does not constrain choice or supply a resource that matters.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears three times as atmospheric refrain. No on-page clock or temporal pressure; the hum does not tighten decisions or impose urgency. The timeframe is ambient mood rather than constraint. Present in setup and ending but ornamental; could be removed without altering Elara's tactics or the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to learn why some people echo" is stated clearly in paragraph four and drives Elara's investigation. The final revelation ("people echo when their stories are unfinished") answers the question. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no friction between the desire to know and the cost of knowing, no dramatized choice where learning compels sacrifice. Present in setup and closure, shapes one key turn, but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is named explicitly and reinforced by imagery ("sorrowful wind that sighed through the canyon slots," "heavy with the weight of unheard stories"). The tone remains consistent but static: no modulation under pressure, no tonal shift at closure. The final "echo…of peace" attempts a turn, yet the melancholy persists in the narrator's register. Coherent across the arc but does not charge the final image with tonal cost or reversal.</comment>
