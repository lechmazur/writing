<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elaris's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories smooth" is established early with concrete family-caravan remorse, and his gift of tasting memories provides character-particular interiority. However, the climactic sequence—kneeling, digging, descending, sampling pools, cooking—reads more as a sequence of actions than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to subsume the pavilion's stored remorse is presented as inevitable once discovered rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative path with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears in "trembled slightly" and "chest like lead," but much of the peak experience is filtered through declarative summary ("visions overlaying," "remorse flooded him") rather than immediate sensory contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rain → puddles → tidal pool analysis → stairwell → pavilion → pool-by-pool alchemical smoothing builds density toward a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors (Kharidun, chef, post-rain) land by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elaris subsumed the stored remorse, his own guilt is "sandpapered," and he returns "ready to cook anew, memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen." Cost is implied—hours of absorbing collective anguish, enduring contagious remorse—but the final image presents resolution as complete smoothing rather than a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The pavilion "dimming as if exhaling" and his "steps lighter" suggest cathartic release without a price that remains legible on the page. No major causality breaks, but the cost at closure reads emotional satisfaction rather than felt or conceptual sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress, rain-slicked walls, and coral icebound pavilion are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (metallic tang, translucent walls veined with frost, ice gleaming like captured moonlight). The pavilion's icebound coral constrains Elaris's task—he must analyze tidal pool formations, map currents, and heat samples—so the environment shapes his method and charges the closure moment when the pavilion thaws. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (courtyard, stairwell, pavilion floor), though the transition from kneeling by a courtyard puddle to "hours blurred as he shoveled" compresses the labor without grounding us in the physical toll. The micro-setting (tidal pools as neural-path analogs) functions thematically and practically, elevating the score, but the pavilion itself arrives late (past the first third) and its properties are introduced via summary rather than discovered tactilely across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing stored remorse to ease his own guilt—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through pool-by-pool sampling and alchemical smoothing, with one meaningful tightening: touching a pool directly surges contagious remorse, which he endures ("sturdy resolve holding his fragility at bay"). However, escalation reads as iterative repetition (draw sample, taste, balance, heat, inhale, repeat) rather than a choice that narrows live options or forces a trade-off. The pavilion's ice cracks "under emotional strain," hinting at environmental cost, but no on-page consequence tests whether the subsuming will harm him or the fortress. The final paragraph presents success as complete—"unspoken dream closed forever," "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen"—without a visible price paid or path foreclosed at closure, reading more as reward than cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—remorse stored, shared, and smoothed through culinary alchemy—emerges concretely from Elaris's gift and the pavilion's function. The motif of "sandpaper rough memories smooth" recurs and shifts meaning from personal guilt to collective healing. However, the final paragraph risks thematic echo when "sturdy, unbrittle sheen" directly restates the tone keywords and "unspoken dream closed forever" tells rather than shows resolution. The pavilion's stored remorse from "dune-wanderers who'd sought shelter ages ago" introduces collective suffering, but the story stops short of complicating Elaris's success—there's no counter-reading or ambiguity about whether subsuming others' pain might perpetuate isolation or cost him something beyond effort. The ending offers emotional satisfaction rather than a non-literal, resonant question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elaris throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated register ("metallic tang," "veined with eternal frost," "neural paths") that fits a chef attuned to sensory and alchemical nuance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight interiority during peak remorse absorption ("gasped, visions overlaying"), wider during the pavilion's discovery. However, several lines drift into over-articulated narration that exceeds Elaris's plausible real-time awareness: "analyzing tidal pool formations—ripples etched in wet sand, patterns like veins of forgotten seas" reads more like authorial description than a character's urgent thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("understood now," "visions overlaying") occasionally dull immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across short and longer sentences, and sensory detail is vivid. However, persistent text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("sturdy brittle reality" echoed in "sturdy resolve holding his fragility," then "sturdy, unbrittle sheen"), template cadence in the pavilion sequence ("He knelt… Tasting it… He gasped… He unpacked… He drew samples…" six consecutive subject-verb stems), and stock metaphors ("like spilled ink," "like lead," "like captured moonlight"). The phrase "remorse stored deep like salt in cured meat" is specific and voice-apt, but "stored remorse" recurs six times without variation, flattening momentum. The climactic pool-by-pool smoothing is summarized in a list ("Pool by pool, he progressed") rather than dramatized with distinct obstacles. Propulsion stalls in the middle third, where scaffolding ("These weren't random; the pavilion stored remorse") tells what the prior sentences already showed. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: template cadence and paraphrase loops touching multiple beats warrant −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7; stock metaphor clusters add another −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination—chef who tastes memories, coral icebound pavilion in a desert, contagious emotion through touch, culinary alchemy as healing—synthesizes familiar fantasy elements (empath healer, buried relic) with specific sensory and setting detail. The tidal pools as neural-path analogs and the pavilion as emotional archive offer fresh inflections. However, the core arc (tortured healer discovers ancient source of collective pain, absorbs it, emerges renewed) follows a recognizable redemption template without moral ambiguity or non-obvious cost. Elaris's success is total: the pavilion lightens, his own remorse is smoothed, he returns ready to cook anew. A bolder choice—leaving one pool untouched, the pavilion collapsing, or discovering the stored remorse includes his family's suffering—would have heightened stakes and meaning. The specificity of desert fortress post-rain and frozen coral elevates the score, but the emotional arc remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Chef Elaris who tastes memories is present from the opening and shapes two key turns: (1) tasting the air's metallic tang primes the rain's pull, (2) tasting pool water triggers visions and remorse absorption at the pavilion. His gift enables the climactic alchemical smoothing ("tasting iteratively to balance the bitterness") and charges the final image of cooking "anew, memories polished." However, the ability is more trait than choice-driver—he uses it to analyze and subsume, but the story does not show him deciding *whether* to taste or endure a cost for using it. The gift's contagious-touch aspect (required element D) is mentioned but not causally distinct from the tasting itself. Setup clear, middle and closure present, but decisions feel inevitable rather than forking.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion is introduced past the first third (late penalty −0.3), but it drives the entire second half: Elaris descends, analyzes its tidal pools, samples their stored remorse, and watches it thaw as he works. The pavilion's "icebound coral pulsing faintly, brittle ice cracking under emotional strain" shows evolving state across beats. It shapes tactics (he must map pool currents, heat samples over portable flame) and charges the closure moment ("pavilion dimming as if exhaling"). Removing the pavilion would collapse the story's logic. However, the discovery is summarized in one line ("Beneath the sands lay the coral icebound pavilion") rather than revealed tactilely, and its properties are told more than shown. Strong middle and closure integration, but late arrival and expository introduction cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the story's conceptual spine: Elaris's own remorse stored "deep like salt in cured meat," the pavilion storing "remorse from dune-wanderers," and his goal to "subsume the remorse into himself." The concept shapes stakes (heal collective and personal guilt) and tactics (analyze, sample, smooth pool by pool). It appears in or shapes the ending: "his own stored remorse mingled in, sandpapered by the collective smoothing." However, the mechanism is more metaphor than on-page constraint—there's no cost to subsuming too much or risk of contamination beyond the already-present contagious touch. The concept drives theme and beats but does not generate a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms. Setup, development, and closure present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious through touch is introduced early ("his gift rendered emotions contagious through touch, spreading sorrow like spilled ink") and used twice: (1) "Touching those old wounds made it worse," motivating isolation, and (2) "Touching a pool directly now, remorse surged contagiously." However, the trait is not distinct from his memory-tasting gift—both involve absorbing emotional content. The second use (touching the pool) merges with tasting ("Tasting it, flavors erupted… contagious through his licked lips as if by touch"), blurring the mechanic. No on-page cost or trade-off is shown; he endures the surge without consequence. Present in setup and one middle beat, but swappable with "absorbing" or "feeling" and not causally essential to the ending. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Subsume is the climactic action: "To heal, he must act; subsume the remorse into himself, sandpaper it through his culinary alchemy." He subsumed the first batch by heating and inhaling, then "Pool by pool, he progressed… He subsumed the stored remorse." The action shapes the ending: "Elaris ascended… his steps lighter." However, "subsume" is chosen late (middle of the story) and could be replaced by "absorb," "transmute," or "cleanse" with minimal edits. The mechanics are told (heat mixture, inhale vapors) rather than shown with unique sensory or physical cost. Setup late (−0.2), closure linkage present (+0.7), but swappability and summary-only use cap the score. Middle-development and closure gates met; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations appears twice: (1) "he analyzed the tidal pool formations—ripples etched in wet sand, patterns like veins of forgotten seas" in the courtyard, prompting him to dig, and (2) "Analyzing each tidal pool formation with precision, he mapped their currents—some clockwise like spirals of guilt, others erratic as fractured oaths" in the pavilion, shaping his sampling order. The method enables the climactic smoothing and charges the closure (pools drained, pavilion dimmed). However, the analysis itself is described rather than dramatized—we do not see him test a hypothesis, misread a pattern, or choose one pool over another with cost. Setup and middle development present; closure linkage indirect (the method enables but does not appear in the final image). Causal role moderate; swappable with "reading," "studying," or "interpreting."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain anchors the opening and primes the inciting choice: "puddles formed in the courtyard, miniature tidal pools mirroring the sky, drawing him outside with an inexplicable pull." The rain softens dunes, enabling the dig ("rain-softened dunes yielding to a concealed stairwell"), and the "rain-fresh dawn" frames the ending. The setting provides resources (portable flame, desert herbs) and shapes the pavilion's incongruity (eternal frost despite desert heat). However, the fortress itself—mercenaries, kitchen window, courtyard—remains backdrop after the opening; the story could unfold in any desert location post-rain with minor edits. Setup strong (+0.6), middle development present (rain-softened dunes), closure presence (rain-fresh dawn) lyric but not causal. Purposeful but partly replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "at the close of an unspoken dream" appears in the second sentence and bookends the ending ("the unspoken dream closed forever"). The dream-to-waking transition motivates the rain's pull and primes the pavilion discovery as a subconscious summons. However, the phrase functions more as thematic frame than time pressure—"hours blurred as he shoveled" and "At last, the final pool drained" compress elapsed time without tightening choices or creating urgency. No clock constrains his work; he completes the task at his own pace. The "unspoken dream" recurs at closure, reweighting the opening, but does not shape tactics. Setup and closure presence; middle development absent. Lyric resonance lifts the score into 3.5–4.0 range, but lack of on-page time pressure and swappability with "vision" or "calling" cap higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to sandpaper rough memories smooth" is signaled in paragraph four, drives the descent and pool work ("To heal, he must act; subsume the remorse into himself, sandpaper it through his culinary alchemy"), and charges the closure ("his own stored remorse mingled in, sandpapered by the collective smoothing" and "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen"). The desire is dramatized through embodied action (kneeling, digging, tasting, heating) and tied to visible family-caravan guilt. However, the motivation does not face friction—no competing want (stay isolated vs. heal, help others vs. protect himself) or cost that tests commitment. He pursues smoothing without deviation or second thought. Setup, development, and closure present; causal pressure moderate but uncomplicated. The final "sandpaper" echo in "sandpapered" and "polished" borders on thematic summary rather than earned realization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tone "sturdy brittle" is invoked three times: "sturdy brittle reality" (opening), "his sturdy frame feeling brittle" (pavilion descent), and "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen" (ending). The pairing of strength and fragility coheres with Elaris's endurance under emotional strain and the pavilion's cracking ice. However, the tone is more label than modulation—the prose does not shift cadence or diction to embody brittleness at peak stress. The ending resolves brittleness into "unbrittle sheen," telling rather than showing tonal transformation. The keywords appear in setup and closure, satisfying the lyric-resonance allowance, but the tone does not charge the final image through rhythm or sensory specificity. Present and thematically consistent, but static and partly ornamental. Functional but replaceable with "fragile strength" or "weary resolve."</comment>
