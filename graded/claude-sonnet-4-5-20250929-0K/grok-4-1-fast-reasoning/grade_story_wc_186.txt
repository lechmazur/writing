<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("doubt gnawed," "hope stirred") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "prove that coincidences held meaning" remains a declared thesis that never encounters an on-page test where she must choose between conflicting goods. The final weeping and descent feel summary-gestural rather than earned by micro-choices under pressure. Retrocognition is label-only; visions are told, not dramatized as a constraint forcing tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with heavy abstraction ("hush of a world unraveled," "glass humming pavilion") that does not anchor who, where, when concretely until the scavenging paragraph; apply −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure—beacon ignites, wanderers will follow—is told rather than shown with visible cost; the "coincidence of winds cleared the clouds" resolves the problem via external luck, not protagonist agency. Drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid but the ending shifts to causal summary without demonstrating the felt price of rekindling or the tactical constraint star-tracking imposed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass pavilion hums, the shard swallows sound, the prism refracts starlight—each detail constrains Elara's tactics (muting echoes, aligning stars). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (base → spiral core → apex), though "dust-choked dawn" and "storms lashed the tower" feel ornamental rather than shaping choice. The shard in her grip during the climb and the skylight lens at the apex charge the final beat, narrowly meeting the Q3 9+ test for micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove patterns versus dismiss as chaos—is signaled early but never tested on-page by a competing pressure or tradeoff. Elara's visions guide her without error; no reversal tightens options. The "coincidence of winds" that clears clouds at the exact alignment resolves the problem externally, undercutting protagonist agency. One meaningful escalation (scavenging → etching charts → climbing the core) is present but the cost of rekindling is told ("wept," "visions confirming") rather than felt in a forfeited path or altered relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme "coincidences have meaning" is stated repeatedly ("Coincidence? Or proof that stars remembered?") rather than emerging from specific events. The final paragraph moralizes ("Coincidences had meaning; the stars proved it") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The shard and beacon accumulate thematic charge but the closure summarizes rather than dramatizes the conceptual cost. "Thistle-blown hope" recurs but as ornament, not a force that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited. Diction is elevated and consistent ("retrocognitively blessed," "thistle-blown echo") but the register stays abstract-lyric throughout; under peak stress (storm, climb, ignition) the voice does not modulate or compress. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she saw") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices abstractions ("fractured visions," "spectral approval") rather than concrete, character-specific details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She knew then" / "Nights blurred" / "She descended"; "the beacon roared alive, its pillar piercing" / "the pavilion hummed louder, a song of persistence." Stock metaphors ("doubt gnawed," "hope stirred," "seeds scattering on hopeful winds") and decorative modifiers ("dust-choked dawn," "thistle-blown hope") replace concrete action. The line "Coincidences had meaning; the stars proved it" in the penultimate paragraph is a thesis statement that flattens the closure image. Apply baseline −1.0 for loops and cadence; artifacts touch closure so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—lone custodian rekindling a beacon with mystical visions and star alignment—reads as a familiar post-apocalyptic template. "Retrocognitively blessed" and "shard of hush" are coined terms but function as labels rather than transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The transformation test fails: swap "retrocognitive" for "prophetic" and "shard of hush" for "focusing crystal" with minor edits and the arc remains unchanged. No bold structural risk; the linear vigil → success arc is comfort-middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (scavenging, etching charts, climbing, positioning the prism) drive beats. However, most choices are observation or execution without on-page conflict; the decision to rekindle is made off-page ("She knew then"). The visions guide without error, so no reversal tests her commitment. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but choices do not create key turns or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken prism is unearthed in paragraph 7, its shard of hush is held during the vigil and climb, and remnants are positioned at the apex to channel the beam. Three beats (discovery, vigil, ignition) with causal pressure: the prism's shattered state necessitates the shard and star-alignment workaround. Closure linkage is strong ("through the prism shards, the shard of hush channeling silence into focused beam"). Late first appearance (paragraph 7, ~40% mark) caps at 4.6; but the object drives middle and ending beats, so adjust upward for beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+1.2), landing solidly in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" swallows sound, deepens retrocognition, and channels silence into the beacon's beam. It constrains tactics (muting pavilion hum, silencing intrusive echoes) and shapes the ending image. Introduced at paragraph 8 (~42%), late penalty −0.4. Two distinct beats (vigil, ignition) +0.9; closure linkage ("shard of hush channeling silence into focused beam") +1.0. Subtract swappability friction: "focusing crystal" could replace it with minor narrative edits −0.5. Net mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Retrocognition is mentioned in paragraph 3 and recurs ("visions surged," "retrocognitive sight overlaid eras") but remains label-only. No on-page scene shows a tradeoff (e.g., visions drain her, distort present perception, or mislead). The trait enables plot (she sees the maker's alignment) but without visible cost. Present in setup and middle summaries, absent from closure action. Ornamental use −0.8; no cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rekindle" is signaled in paragraph 11 ("the beacon-tower's core … could be rekindled") and enacted in the climax (paragraph 26, "Light surged—rekindled"). The action is the story's major turn and defines the ending image. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure (entire vigil sequence builds toward it) +1.2. The action is irreplaceable; the story exists to dramatize this rekindling. Strong essential range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tracking star paths" is named in paragraph 12 and executed on-page: Elara etches star charts (paragraph 19), aligns Orion and Cassiopeia (paragraph 20), and uses the skylight lens to position Polaris and Pleiades (paragraph 24). Three beats with mechanics shown. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure participation (the alignment ignites the beam) +1.0. The method is specific and matters. Solid essential range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion frames the entire story (paragraph 2) and recurs: its hum vibrates approval (paragraph 19), crescendoes at ignition (paragraph 25), and sings louder at closure (paragraph 28). The setting constrains (hum must be muted by the shard) and the glass floors become star-chart surfaces. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (pavilion hums louder as Elara descends) +0.8. Borderline essential; the pavilion is integral to the vigil and ending atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the collapse of civilization" is stated in paragraph 1 and referenced ("the collapse's thunder," "post-collapse vigil") but functions as backdrop. No live countdown or temporal pressure tightens Elara's choices; "nights blurred into a vigil" compresses time without tactical consequence. Setup present, minimal middle development (vague duration), closure uses the label but not the constraint. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that coincidences held meaning" is declared in paragraph 6, repeated in paragraph 16 ("Meaning, she whispered"), and asserted at closure ("Coincidences had meaning; the stars proved it"). The desire drives the rekindling project but is never dramatized as conflicted choice—no scene shows Elara weighing the cost of proving the thesis versus another goal. Setup +0.6, beat mentions (vigil, ignition) +0.4, closure participation (theme statement) +0.5. Told-only friction −0.6. Mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" appears in paragraph 4 ("Thistle-blown echo"), paragraph 17 ("Thistle-blown hope stirred"), paragraph 26 ("scattering thistle-blown hope"), and paragraph 29 ("like thistles on the breeze"). The tone is consistent and modulates slightly (stirred → scattered → endured) with pressure. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure reprise +0.8. However, the metaphor is ornamental; removing "thistle-blown" would not alter the emotional arc. Decorative use −0.8; swappability −0.5. Net mid-5s.</comment>
