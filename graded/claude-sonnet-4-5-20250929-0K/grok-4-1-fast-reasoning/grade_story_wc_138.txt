<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen's boredom and yearning for novelty are established, but his immortal psychology remains abstract. The decision to trigger the mutiny reads as ornamental curiosity rather than embodied contradiction or stakes-raising choice. The curse's "dimensional awareness" is label-only; we never see him wrestle with competing impulses or pay a visible cost for his action beyond a generic dissolution into "endless novelty."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "prismatic escondite" and "dimensional veil" are never anchored spatially or temporally. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern, nor situational crystallization is taught early or held at closure. The ending dissolves into abstract claims ("after goodbye waits not nothing, but thunder hushed into symphonies") without on-page cost or visible change in options. Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "prismatic escondite" is decorative; walls of "refracted light" and "iridescent corridors" offer no spatial grounding or constraint on action. The solar storm and magnetic fields are asserted but never shape a choice or alter tactics. No object, tool, or micro-setting detail charges the final image or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"what happens after goodbye"—is told repeatedly but never tested on the page. Elowen's "intrigue" escalates through assertion rather than through narrowing options or raising cost. The fragment's curse enables the mutiny without friction or trade-off, and the resolution ("eternity fragmented—not ended, but reborn") lacks visible consequence or earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The theme is stated rather than dramatized: "What happens after goodbye?" appears verbatim multiple times and is answered in the final lines with abstract philosophy ("after goodbye waits not nothing, but thunder hushed into symphonies"). The amulet, storm, and mutiny are symbols invoked rather than particulars that constrain choice. Thematic Echo penalty applied (−0.6) for prompt-like language in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature ("dimensionally aware") is consistent, but the register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("veins of liquid iron," "serpents in the void"). Diction reads as ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("symphonies of beginning") compresses without clear earned meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries stacked figurative language ("bruised violets and searing crimsons," "liquid iron," "velvet rumble," "auroral fire"), creating density without momentum. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("intrigue," "mutiny," "dimensional awareness" recycled). Template cadence runs appear in the climax ("walls shimmered, fracturing… dimensions clashing… escondite groaned"). Patterned-artifact penalty pack applied: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure beat, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—immortal boredom solved by cosmic rebellion—is a recognizable template. The "cursed amulet fragment" and "spatial mutiny" are stock genre tokens without fresh synthesis. The ending's novelty claim ("eternity fragmented… reborn in endless novelty") is asserted rather than earned through specific detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative Premise Guardrail applied: −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout and his choice to trigger the mutiny occurs on the page, but the decision is ornamental—he acts from curiosity rather than conflicted motive with visible cost. Setup is met; development is thin (one choice); closure participation is abstract ("elsewhere, chasing horizons"). Two gates met, but swappability and lack of cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amulet fragment is introduced early, handled twice (touch in paragraph 4, positioned at nexus in paragraph 26), and crumbles at closure. It enables the mutiny but does not constrain or impose a dramatized trade-off. Setup, development (weak), and payoff gates are met, but the element's mechanics remain ornamental and its cost is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is invoked throughout but never defines on-page tactics or narrows options. Elowen "perceives" and "channels" it through assertion rather than dramatized action. The concept functions as theme rather than stake. Setup is met; middle development is summary-only; closure participation is metaphoric ("dimensions clashing"). Missing meaningful development caps the score at 3.4; lyric reprise lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Dimensionally aware" is a label applied after the curse blooms. It enables perception ("seeing folds where others glimpsed flatness") but does not constrain or impose visible cost. Setup is met; middle use is ornamental; closure participation is told ("he felt the goodbye approaching"). Missing constraint and cost; swappable with "enhanced perception." Cap at 4.6 for late signal, further lowered for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Intrigue is present in Elowen's motives and actions (channeling the fragment, inverting fields, positioning the nexus). Setup and development gates are met. However, the action is interchangeable with "curiosity" or "scheming" and does not uniquely redefine options. Closure participation is weak ("intrigue peaked" is summary). Swappability and lack of unique cost limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are introduced early (paragraph 2) and appear in middle beats (paragraphs 15, 18–19) as the method for channeling the mutiny. Setup and development gates are met. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown, and the fields could be swapped for "energy pulses" without structural change. Closure participation is ornamental ("fields collapsed inward"). Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is named early and provides the spatial frame throughout. Setup and closure participation (reformed in paragraph 37) are met. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop. Decorative mentions and lack of causal pressure limit the score. Two gates met, but no development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The solar storm is introduced in paragraph 2 and referenced in middle beats (paragraphs 14, 19, 24) as the amplifying condition for the mutiny. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The storm's peak coincides with the climax, but it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Functional role across beats without unique constraint places the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elowen's desire to discover what happens after goodbye is stated early (paragraph 3) and drives his choice to trigger the mutiny (paragraphs 11, 17, 22). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The motivation is told repeatedly rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices with visible cost. The ending claims fulfillment ("he had discovered it") without showing friction. Functional but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is introduced early (paragraph 2) and recurs in paragraphs 8, 19, 34, 38. Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the tone is ornamental—a repeated phrase rather than a modulating atmosphere that charges the final image. The storm "hushed to a velvet rumble" and the ending invokes "thunder hushed into symphonies" as metaphor rather than embodied pressure. Lyric reprise without causal force.</comment>
