<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to collect wall-stories is stated but never tested by conflicting desires or meaningful cost. His "sensitively perceptive" trait is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final image shows him "fulfilled" but no on-page choice forecloses a path—he simply settles into what he was already doing. The diarist predecessor remains a shadow; no relationship pressure exists.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late and remain vague—"bronze quiet," "reclaimed silo library," and "after the last human dream" are atmospheric but imprecise past ~120 words. The closure offers thematic repricing ("a dreamless man dreaming through stone") but no visible cost or foreclosed path; Thorne ends where he began, listening to walls. The displaced axis and dragon mythology accumulate density but do not tighten options or produce a decisive change. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The silo's tilted axis, leaning bookshelves, and upward-spiraling dust create vivid atmosphere and anchor the conceptual frame. The fireplace chamber and tapestry fragment supply tactile detail. However, the setting remains largely decorative—no spatial constraint shapes Thorne's choices or alters tactics. The final mounting of the tapestry on the central pillar charges the image but arrives as curation rather than consequence. The cap from Q2 orientation debt applies here (7.0 max); score reflects solid atmospheric work without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting wall-stories—is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. Thorne probes the sealed chamber and unearths diaries without facing opposition, trade-offs, or reversals. The diaries' revelation (dragons, axis tilt, human dreamlessness) adds information but does not force a decision or foreclosure. The ending reprises his original activity with no visible cost or altered tactic. No on-page reversal or tightening deepens pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the displaced axis, dreamless void, and wall-stories as repository of lost meaning. The tapestry fragment and final image ("a dreamless man dreaming through stone") offer resonant particulars rather than abstraction. However, the piece resists testing its central question—whether collecting stories can anchor against the void—through on-page friction or cost. The ending feels more declarative than earned, though it avoids overt moralizing. Q4's low escalation limits thematic charge here.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is attempted ("ears pressed to cold surfaces," wall-whispers) but leans toward metaphor rather than embodied perception. Diction drifts into elevated register ("bronze quiet," "voiceless murmurs," "half-remembered regrets") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose reads more committee-lyric than Thorne-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or figurative flourish ("bronze quiet deepened to a hush of aged metal," "pages curled like dying leaves," "stars in a skewed sky") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence and synonym churn appear throughout ("odd historian," "sensitively perceptive," "bronze quiet" recur as labels). Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., paragraphs 4–5 restate axis-tilt effects). Applying density penalty (−0.6), coherence penalty for mixed metaphors (−0.5), and loop penalty (−0.4); total artifact debt −1.5. Line-level density ≤7.0 triggers cross-cap: Q6 capped at 7.6, 9+ disallowed globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—historian in post-dream silo collecting wall-stories via tilted axis and dragon tapestry—synthesizes multiple prompt elements but reads more as ingredient assembly than transformation. The "displaced axis" and "last human dream" tropes lean abstract; the dragon mythology adds texture but no fresh moral calculus or risk. Emotional truth is gestured toward (Thorne "fulfilled") but not tested on the page. Proximity to "archive of lost worlds" templates is close. Within-band derivative penalty (−0.8) applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Thorne is present throughout and performs actions (probes, unearths, transcribes, mounts tapestry) but no choice creates a turn or cost. His role is observer/curator; decisions are curatorial rather than stake-altering. Introduced early (setup gate met), appears in middle beats (development gate met), and in the ending (payoff gate met), but swappable with "archivist" or "curator" with minor edits. All three gates met allow eligibility up to ~6.0, but lack of causal pressure and swappability cap at 3.8; round to 3.2 for ornamental execution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is unearthed mid-story (introduced ~50% mark; late penalty −0.3), described with specificity (dragons, gold scales, cosmic spindle), and mounted on the central pillar at closure. It appears in two beats (discovery, mounting; +0.9) and links to closure (+0.7), but does not constrain a choice or narrow options—Thorne's decision to mount it is curatorial, not pressed by cost. Introduced after 40% cap (4.6) conflicts with closure linkage; lyric-resonance allowance and closure participation lift to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The displaced axis is described extensively (tilted silo, warped gravity, seismic scars) and frames the conceptual premise, appearing early and at closure. However, it remains thematic backdrop rather than tactical constraint—it does not alter Thorne's options or force a decision. Present in setup, development (diarist's notes), and payoff (final image), meeting all three gates. Eligible for ≥6.1, but swappability (could be "temporal rift" or "dimensional fold") and lack of causal pressure cap at ~4.8; textural work raises to 4.1 within band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is labeled in paragraph 3 and gestured toward ("ears pressed to cold surfaces," "decoding faint vibrations") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Thorne's perception does not create a trade-off, mistake, or choice under pressure. Label-only artifact (−0.3), no beat involvement beyond description. Setup gate met (early mention), development and payoff gates missed (no middle choice, no closure participation). Missing middle and closure caps at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Probe" appears in the inciting move (sealed chamber), the diarist's backstory (probing foundations), and Thorne's method throughout (probing walls, deeper probing by fireplace). Present in three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (probing leads to discovery; +0.8), and closure linkage (final paragraph "no more probing needed"; +0.9). However, the action is somewhat generic—"investigate" or "explore" could substitute with minor edits (swappability −0.5). All three gates met; causal and closure work lift to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The diaries are found in the fireplace (~40% mark; late penalty −0.2), supply the tapestry fragment and backstory, and are transcribed by Thorne. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—half-burned pages, fragile remnants, fevered entries shape the discovery. Appears in two beats (discovery, transcription; +0.9), causal pressure (diaries reveal cache and diarist's fate; +0.8), but absent from final image (no closure linkage). Setup (first third miss; −0.3), development and partial payoff gates met. Eligible ~6.0; late and closure-absence lower to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored early, supplies the fireplace chamber and central pillar, and the tilted axis affects spatial logic (leaning bookshelves). Present across all beats and in the final mounting scene. Three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (sealed chamber constrains access; axis warps time/space; +1.0), closure linkage (central pillar hosts tapestry; +1.0). However, setting does not force a tactical choice or decision under pressure—Thorne navigates it without friction. All three gates met; strong presence but passive role yields 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the last human dream is dreamt" anchors the timeframe in the opening and recurs thematically (diarist's "last dreams fled," Thorne "after all dreams had died"). Present in setup, development (diarist backstory), and payoff (final line). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no live clock or ticking pressure. Swappable with "post-apocalyptic" or "post-collapse era" (−0.6). Thematic resonance at closure (+0.5) but no tactical constraint; round to 3.6 for abstract execution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Thorne's desire to collect wall-stories is stated early, drives his probing and transcription, and is reprised at closure ("collecting these stories anchored him," "fulfilled"). Present in three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (motivation prompts chamber discovery; +0.7), closure linkage (final fulfillment; +0.8). However, the motivation is never tested by conflict or cost—Thorne pursues it without friction, loss, or competing desire. Told rather than dramatized through choice (summary penalty −0.5). All three gates met; lack of friction caps at ~5.6; round to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in the opening line, recurs five times, and frames the ending ("In that bronze quiet, stories flowed freely"). Setup and payoff gates met; development presence via repetition. Tone is consistent and modulates subtly (deepens to "hush," contrasts with Thorne's laugh). Closure linkage (+0.8) and pattern (+0.5). However, tone remains largely static—a single sustained mood rather than pressure-responsive modulation. Swappable with "hushed stillness" or "ancient silence" (−0.6). Lyric reprise and closure work lift to 4.9 within mid-band.</comment>
