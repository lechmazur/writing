<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to awaken suppressed histories—is established but her internal contradiction ("bravely conflicted") is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The story tells us she wars between duty and urge, then moves swiftly to action without showing the genuine struggle at the decision point. Her agency at the console is clear, but the moment lacks embodied cost or a hierarchy of competing values made visible through micro-choices. The phrase "bravely conflicted no more—action had chosen for her" externalizes the choice rather than making her wrestle with it on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a Causal lens: Elara sees the map, reads it as a sign, transmits the letter, and pods activate. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words of atmospheric description—but the disorientation does not pay off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure moment (pods humming, networks spreading, Elara smiling) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("scandalize," "allies in the ice") rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or visible consequence. The phrase "action had chosen for her" diffuses agency at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Vault Library setting—ice-glazed shelves, cryo-pods, frost-rimed controls—is vividly rendered and atmospherically dense, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The console and pods are present throughout, but no environmental feature narrows Elara's options or complicates her choice at the climax. The snow and echoing chambers recur as mood rather than pressure, and the final image does not depend on a specific physical detail to charge its meaning. Micro-setting (the console, the pods) is handled but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to transmit the letter and awaken the networks—is signaled early and remains coherent. The glitching monitor provides an on-page reversal, but Elara's decision follows swiftly without a visible tightening of options or a trade-off made legible. The consequence (alarms topside, scandal, network awakening) is declared in future tense rather than dramatized as immediate cost. No persistent constraint (stamina, tool, social credit) shapes her tactics; the safeguards are overridden with "archivist's intimate knowledge" in a single beat. The escalation reads as assertion rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—suppressed histories as power, silence vs. revelation—emerges from the premise and accumulates through recurring images of frost, contraband, and echo. The phrase "revolution in murmurs" gestures toward complexity, but the ending articulates the theme overtly ("scandalizing the world one frozen mind at a time") rather than letting the final image resonate without summary. The "unspoken conversation" motif is repeated to the point of label, diluting subtext. No competing good or unavoidable harm complicates the moral calculus; the Regime is villainous, the dissidents sympathetic, and Elara's choice feels morally unambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, and the voice carries a distinct lyric register ("dizzying quiet," "electric hush of revelation"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing does not feel archivist-specific or character-particular. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("contraband truths coded to awaken select dormant networks") that clashes with embodied urgency. The phrase "bravely conflicted" recurs as a label rather than filtering perception, and "action had chosen for her" externalizes agency in a way that undercuts the established voice. No dialogue appears; all interiority is narrated, reducing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Bravely conflicted" appears three times; "dizzying quiet" four times; "contraband truths" five times, creating synonym churn without added pressure. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "duty warring with a deeper urge" / "bravely conflicted between preservation and provocation." Long runs share identical stems ("She had prepared," "She pictured," "She moved"). Stock metaphors ("quiet fire," "electric hush") and filter-verb stacks ("she glimpsed," "she pictured," "she sealed") dull immediacy at peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence runs, and filter stacks across multiple beats, with artifacts touching the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—cryogenic dissident library, archivist rebellion—leans on familiar dystopian templates (forbidden knowledge, Regime control, neural networks) without a fresh synthesis. The "dangerous liaison letter" and "contraband truths" are generic terms that could apply to many resistance stories. The turn (glitching monitor as sign) and method (neural webs awakening) are declared rather than made inevitable through specific world logic or character-particular insight. Emotional truth is present but not specific enough to transform the template. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the narrative follows a predictable arc from duty to rebellion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara, the cryogenic archivist, is present throughout and her occupation frames the setting, but her decision to transmit the letter is not constrained by archivist-specific knowledge or method in a way that makes her irreplaceable. The phrase "archivist's intimate knowledge" asserts expertise but does not dramatize it. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending) and drives the key turn, but her role could be swapped for "librarian," "technician," or "guard" with minimal edits. Causal pressure is present but not uniquely tied to her archival identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "dangerous liaison letter" is introduced in the second act ("She had prepared for this"), used once (transmission beat), and mentioned again at the end ("The dangerous liaison letter had done its work"). It appears in two distinct beats and shapes the climax, but its properties are generic—"encrypted coordinates," "ignition," "protocol"—and could be replaced by "signal," "code," or "message." The letter does not return with reweighted meaning; its function is identical at introduction and closure. It constrains one choice and participates in the ending, but specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" appears in the opening paragraph, recurs five times, and motivates Elara's action (to share suppressed histories). It frames the dominant stake and shapes the transmission tactic, appearing in all three gates. However, the concept is abstract and repeatedly labeled ("truths deemed contraband," "contraband truths coded," "contraband truths now liaisons") without concrete dramatization of what the truths are or how they alter tactics on the page. The phrase functions as theme claim more than causal lever. Specificity is low; "forbidden knowledge" would substitute cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" is introduced early, recurs three times, and labels Elara's state throughout. However, it remains a descriptor rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. The internal conflict is asserted ("duty warring with a deeper urge") but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses at the decision point. The phrase "bravely conflicted no more—action had chosen for her" tells resolution rather than showing a trade-off. It appears in setup and middle but does not drive a specific beat or charge the closure; swappable with "torn," "uncertain," or "hesitant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Scandalize" is invoked four times and names the intended effect of Elara's action: to provoke anomalous signals, expose cracks, rage censors topside. It appears in setup ("to scandalize the Regime"), at the climax ("she had scandalized the silence"), and in the ending ("scandalizing the world one frozen mind at a time"). The action shapes the dominant stake and participates in closure, but the consequences are narrated in future or summary tense rather than dramatized on the page. Specificity is moderate; the term could be replaced by "disrupt," "expose," or "provoke" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dormant networks" are introduced early ("ancient neural webs linking the pods, long powered down"), reappear at the transmission beat ("threading through cryo-circuits long silent"), and recur in the ending ("the networks dreamed on"). The method is signaled, constrains Elara's tactic (she must override safeguards to activate them), and charges the final image. It appears in all three gates and drives two beats (transmission, cascade). However, the mechanics are abstract—"neural links," "electric hush," "synchronized pod anomalies"—and could be replaced by "system," "grid," or "connection" with moderate edits. Causal pressure is present; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "echoing library under snow" is established in the opening paragraph and recurs throughout ("Vault Library," "snow entombed," "dizzying quiet," "echoing eternally under snow"). It provides atmosphere and frames the setting in all three gates, but it does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The console and pods are functional objects within the library, but the library itself (its echo, snow, vastness) is postcard description rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. The final image invokes "the Vault's core" but does not depend on a specific environmental feature to carry its charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" is introduced at the monitor glitch and recurs twice ("In that suspended blink," "In the blink's tail"). However, the story does not track elapsed time or use the timeframe to tighten decisions. The blink is metaphorical rather than literal—beats span preparation, transmission, cascade, reflection, and ending without temporal constraint. No live clock alters Elara's moves; the "blink" functions as lyric repetition rather than pressure device. Present in setup and ending but ornamental; easily removable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to provoke an unspoken conversation" is stated explicitly in the second act and drives her transmission choice. It appears in setup (implicitly, as she catalogs silenced minds), at the climax ("to provoke what words never could"), and in the ending ("the unspoken conversation spread"). The desire is dramatized in one key beat (the transmission) and shapes the closure image, but friction between want and cost is asserted rather than embodied. The phrase recurs as label; specificity is moderate. Swappable with "to awaken," "to connect," or "to liberate" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" is introduced in the opening sentence and recurs four times ("dizzying quiet amplifying her heartbeat," "dizzying quiet deepened," "dizzying quiet no longer oppressive"). It establishes tone in setup and participates in the ending, but the mood remains static—hushed, echoing—without modulation under pressure. The tone does not tighten at the climax or shift cadence to reflect escalation; each invocation restates atmosphere rather than charging the final image. Present in two gates (setup, ending) but ornamental; easily replaced by "silence," "hush," or "stillness."</comment>
