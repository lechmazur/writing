<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation (grounding spirits his brother failed to save) is stated clearly but remains inert; it never creates a visible choice dilemma or cost on the page. His actions follow a single procedural track—unravel, restore, repeat—without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("lucid unrest," "motives deepened") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The shade and released spirits remain functionally identical, never applying distinct pressure or forcing Lirien to weigh competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery and motif repetition dominate), but the closure lacks visible cost: Lirien's "fractured core" is mended off-page, "lucid unrest evolved to quiet resolve" is told rather than shown, and no path is foreclosed with on-page consequence. The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied by ~120 words (prism sanctuary, mask restorer, tonight), but spatial choreography drifts—silt, net, workbench, and prisms lack stable spatial logic. The because/therefore chain is weak: the shade's confession stretches "across hours" without pressure escalation, and spirits are released in a loop rather than through meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight anchors are vivid and recur purposefully, charging the final dawn image. The tapestry needle and net gain tactile presence through handling ("needle dove deeper," "knots bloated with silenced screams"), and the sanctuary's sensory palette—fractured light, silt, porcelain—remains coherent. However, spatial choreography is vague: the net's location relative to workbench and prisms is unclear, and "hanging crystals" never constrain movement or choice. Sensory detail tilts heavily visual; touch and sound are underused in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (ground restless spirits), but escalation is minimal: each unraveled knot releases a spirit in identical fashion, with no rising cost or narrowing options until the "final knot resisted" moment. That single tightening arrives too late and too briefly to charge the prior material. The shade's "endless secret-weaving words" claim duration but do not impose a ticking constraint or force a trade-off. Agency exists (Lirien chooses to unravel), yet the procedural repetition ("first knot," "second spirit," "a dozen spirits") flattens pressure rather than escalates it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the interlaced hush/silence motif and the restoration-as-grounding metaphor, avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("lucid unrest evolved to quiet resolve") gestures at resonance but relies on abstract label-speak rather than a concrete, non-literal answer. The brother's memory and Lirien's "fractured core" are told rather than dramatized, so the thematic payoff lacks particularity. Subtext operates weakly in the shade's confession, which unspools exposition rather than implication. The sanctuary's murmurs and settled souls offer a quiet ending, but the cost is not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is weak: Lirien's narration defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush," "accumulating silence") that clashes with the tactile work of a restorer. The shade's voice ("I share a secret across this night," "It binds my own echo") reads as stilted and ornamental rather than goal-driven. POV distance is stable, but psychic proximity never tightens under pressure—peak beats ("Unrest crested—prisms trembled") remain externalized. Dialogue carries no subtext or evasion; the shade delivers exposition without pursuit or resistance. Template cadence appears in beats 17–22 ("The second spirit burst forth," "The shade shared more," "Lirien's needle flew").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "interlaced hush," "accumulating silence," "centuries-old fisherman's net," and "lucid unrest" recur without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the middle third ("A faint moan escaped," "The second spirit burst forth," "Hours bled as the shade shared more"). Filter verbs ("perceived," "gazed," "felt") stack in high-pressure beats where immediacy is needed. Figurative density is high but often mixed: "silence accumulated, pooling like ink" competes with "hush's residue" and "silence dispersing like mist." The final beat ("lucid unrest evolved to quiet resolve") summarizes rather than shows. Information density is low; many lines restate the core concept without advancing stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (mask restorer freeing spirits from a net of silence) offers a fresh synthesis, and the prism sanctuary anchors specificity. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes: the restless spirit guide, the object-freeing ritual, the wounded healer with a dead brother. The "interlaced hush" concept is vivid but underexploited—it never constrains choice or complicates restoration in a non-obvious way. Emotional beats (brother's memory, fractured core mended) follow predictable arcs without fresh inflection. The transformation test reveals generic scaffolding: swap "mask restorer" for "soul healer" and the arc survives largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien appears in setup, drives middle beats (unraveling, restoring), and anchors the ending image, satisfying all three gates. His restorer skill is causally necessary—without it, spirits cannot be grounded. However, his choices lack friction: he never weighs competing goods, and the procedural unraveling allows no meaningful decision dilemma. The brother's memory is invoked but does not alter tactics. Cost is abstract ("fractured core" mended off-page). Early signal +0.5, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, minus ornamental interiority −0.5, minus swappability (any restorer role) −0.6, minus summary-only brother cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tapestry needle is introduced early ("retrieved from a velvet pouch"), used across multiple beats ("pierced the first knot," "needle dove deeper," "pocketed the tapestry needle"), and returns with charged residue ("tip stained with hush's residue") at closure, satisfying all three gates. Its specific mechanics (patient, precise) shape Lirien's method. However, the needle could be swapped for any fine tool without structural loss—its unique properties do not enable a choice only it permits. Early signal +0.5, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal enabler +0.8, closure reprise +0.9, specificity +0.3, minus swappability (any needle/awl) −0.7, minus static descriptive use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "interlaced hush" is named repeatedly and frames the net's function, satisfying setup and closure mention. It appears in middle beats as the substance Lirien unravels. However, it operates as flavor text rather than a live constraint: the hush never complicates unraveling, forces a trade-off, or narrows Lirien's options. Its mechanics (silence woven into knots) are told but not dramatically tested. Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3, thematic coloring +0.2, minus ornamental/label-only use −0.8, minus no causal pressure −0.9, minus swappability (any metaphysical trap) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" describes the net's property and recurs across beats ("silence accumulated, pooling like ink," "accumulating hush's press"). It is present in setup, middle, and ending. Yet it never constrains an on-page action or forces Lirien to adjust tactics—the accumulation is described, not dramatized as a rising cost or obstacle. Early signal +0.3, three-beat involvement +1.0, thematic texture +0.2, minus label-only trait −0.8, minus no visible tradeoff −0.9, minus static repetition −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Exhume" is signaled early ("to exhume them"), drives the unraveling action across middle beats ("exhuming wisps of essence," "unraveling relentlessly, exhuming a dozen spirits"), and directly shapes the ending (final spirit materialized, mask restored). All three gates are satisfied. The action is causally necessary—spirits cannot be freed without it. However, the execution is procedurally repetitive without escalation, and "exhume" could be replaced by "release" or "free" with minor phrasing edits. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.3, minus swappability −0.6, minus repetitive execution −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method (unraveling knots in the net) is signaled in the shade's instruction, executed across multiple beats ("pierced the first knot," "needle dove deeper," "unraveling relentlessly"), and culminates in the final knot's resistance and dispersal. All three gates are met. The mechanics matter: the tapestry needle and patient unraveling are causally linked to freeing spirits. However, the method is swappable (any knot-release ritual could serve), and the "centuries-old fisherman's net" detail is ornamental—its age and origin do not affect Lirien's approach. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal mechanics +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus swappability −0.7, minus ornamental fisherman backstory −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is anchored early and recurs throughout ("hanging crystals," "fractured glow," "prisms overhead pulsed," "prisms steadying"). It provides atmospheric texture and supplies the starlight that charges the opening and closing images, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, the sanctuary never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lirien's work would proceed identically in any workshop. The spatial elements (silt, net, workbench) lack coherent choreography. Early signal +0.6, closure reprise +0.7, thematic texture +0.3, minus no causal pressure −1.0, minus postcard description −0.6, minus spatial vagueness −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" is invoked early ("the shade began," "words unspooling across hours") and recurs ("across that shared secret"). However, time is vague and untethered: "hours bled" and "stars tracing their arcs" suggest duration without tightening decisions or altering tactics. No clock constrains Lirien's choices, and the "night's zenith" arrival is decorative. The timeframe functions as thematic flavor rather than a live pressure. Early signal +0.3, closure mention +0.2, minus vague/untracked time −0.9, minus no tactical pressure −1.0, minus ornamental use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation (to ground spirits his brother failed to save) is signaled early, recurs in mid-story ("his brother's face haunted him"), and is invoked at closure ("In grounding the restless, he had mended his own fractured core"). All three gates are satisfied. The desire is coherent and thematically central. However, it is told rather than dramatized: the brother never creates an on-page friction or forces a choice between competing loyalties. The mended core is summary, not scene. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, thematic coherence +0.4, minus told-only brother cost −0.8, minus no friction/trade-off −0.6, minus summary ending −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named in the opening beat and recurs throughout ("lucid clarity, unrest coiling," "sea's lucid unrest," "lucid unrest lingered," "lucid unrest evolved"). It modulates slightly (from ambient to coiling to resolved) and charges the final image. However, the tone is label-dependent rather than embodied: "lucid" and "unrest" are asserted more than shown through syntax or image. The final "evolved to quiet resolve" tells rather than demonstrates tonal shift. Early signal +0.5, closure charge +0.6, modulation +0.3, minus label-only execution −0.8, minus told shift −0.5, minus static repetition −0.3.</comment>
