<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and drives her nocturnal tinkering, but her agency remains largely unopposed—she sings, the loom works, the village awakens, problem solved. Internal contradiction is absent; she's whimsical throughout with no cost that tests her resolve or forces a trade-off between competing values. The villagers' sudden participation feels convenient rather than earned through dramatized resistance or misunderstanding. Her final pocket coil reads as sequel setup rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Elowen's singing activates the loom, which spins stories that restore practices and heal blight. Closure is Decisive Change (sacred practices bloom anew, blight retreats), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no on-page sacrifice, failure, or foreclosed path that Elowen herself bears. The villagers' transformation happens to them rather than through contested choice. The spare vine tendril coiled in her pocket suggests easy repeatability, undercutting the stakes of this alignment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is vividly rendered with twisting branches, woven platform, and heartwood; the harvest moon's amber glow defies the sun and charges the alignment. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop. The platform's height, the vine's origin in the heartwood, and the arbor's roots are described but do not constrain Elowen's choices or complicate her remedy. The golden stories "float down" to the villagers without spatial friction or environmental resistance, reducing the arbor to scenic rather than functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices to heal blight—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs: the harvest moon dipping toward the horizon as dawn approaches, creating temporal pressure for alignment. Yet Elowen faces no opposition, mishap, or cost; the loom works as intended, the villagers respond on cue, and blight retreats. No visible price is paid, no tactic altered by failure. The spare tendril in her pocket at the end suggests she can repeat this remedy at will, flattening the stakes retroactively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—bridging past and present through communal memory—emerges from the golden stories and the villagers' reclaimed songs rather than direct statement. The ending image of thickened vines and moon-and-song harvests offers resonance. However, Elowen's legend status and the relic loom veer toward overt thematic summary ("whimsy and memory had mended what time had torn"). The final phrase "when everything aligns once more, the hush will gather again" reads as an explicit thematic echo rather than an earned, non-literal answer, softening the impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent—elevated, lyric diction with purposeful compression ("thistledown," "rind," "drape like a silken veil"). POV remains stable third-limited on Elowen; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately as the loom activates and the village awakens. However, perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than character-specific; Elowen's interiority reads as narrator's poetic commentary more than her own idiom under pressure. The villagers' awakening ("eyes wide," "gasped," "mimicked") lacks distinct voice or subtext, and Elowen's dialogue line feels writerly rather than spoken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, though dense in early paragraphs ("silken veil," "acorn shells and beetle wings," "thistledown"). Clarity holds; no loops or contradictions. However, minor scaffold appears: "the attribute of her loom spun golden stories" is expository mid-action, and several sentences open with formulaic constructions ("Those forgotten songs," "Below, in the village," "The arbor folk"). The phrase "a glowing tapestry" and "roots below pulsed with renewed vigor, blight retreating like shadows at noon" edge toward stock metaphor. Information density is high but momentum flags in the long middle paragraph cataloging story threads.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—whimsical tinkerer uses magical loom and forgotten songs to restore ritual and heal blight—follows familiar fantasy-restoration templates without sharp transformation. The vine tendril loom, acorn gears, and golden-story motif are vivid but operate as expected; no rule violation or cost surprises the reader. The harvest moon alignment and communal awakening are earnest but predictable. The spare tendril pocket-coil at the end signals sequel potential rather than bold, singular closure. Emotional honesty is present but the arc lacks risk or a non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate synthesis into fresh territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen (whimsical tinkerer) is present throughout and her choices—tinkering, singing—drive the remedy. Setup early, involved in the remedy beat, and named in the closing legend paragraph (three gates met). However, her decisions face no resistance or adaptation; she executes a plan that works as intended. The "whimsical" trait colors description but does not constrain or complicate her choices under pressure. Her final pocket coil is a gesture toward future action rather than a choice with cost here. Functional but her agency does not create a key reversal or tradeoff. Mid-band; causal but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vine tendril appears early (harvested under moonlight), forms the loom's spindle, quivers to absorb Elowen's song, spins the golden stories, and stills at closure (three gates; multiple beats). Its "supple yet unbreakable" property matters on-page, and the spare tendril coiled in Elowen's pocket at the end reprises it with reweighted implication (future use). The tendril enables the remedy and its stillness marks completion. Removing it would break the mechanism. Strong integration; docked slightly because the spare tendril dilutes the cost of this alignment's uniqueness rather than deepening it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Harvest moon (core concept) is introduced in paragraph three, frames the alignment stakes, and its setting coincides with the loom's final note at closure (setup, development, payoff met). Its "power to bridge forgotten realms" and celestial timing shape when Elowen can act and amplify the loom's magic. However, the moon functions more as symbolic backdrop than active constraint; Elowen does not struggle with its timing or risk missing the window. Its presence is necessary for the logic but does not force a tactical choice or tradeoff on the page. Solid causal role; not indispensable to agency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Attribute "spins golden stories" is named explicitly mid-action ("the attribute of her loom spun golden stories") and demonstrated as the loom draws threads that imprint visions on the villagers. The stories enable the remedy by restoring memory and practice (payoff clear). However, the phrasing "the attribute of" is expository label rather than dramatized property, and no cost or constraint attaches to the spinning itself—it simply works. The trait is functional and closure-linked but not irreplaceable; "weaves memories" or "projects visions" would serve similarly. Mid-6s for causal presence without felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Remedy (action) is Elowen's goal from paragraph six, unfolds in the alignment scene as she sings and the loom spins, and the closing paragraphs confirm its success (blight retreats, practices restored). The remedy shapes the entire second half and closure hinges on it. However, the remedy is unopposed and proceeds as planned; removing it would require a different ending, but its execution does not create a reversal or force Elowen to adapt. Strong structural role; not indispensable in the high-band sense because it lacks cost or friction. Upper-7s for clear two-beat involvement and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method "through forgotten songs" is signaled in paragraph fifteen ("forgotten songs were the key"), dramatized as Elowen lifts "the first forgotten song" to activate the loom, and sustained through her singing across multiple beats until the loom hums its final note. The songs' tones "resonated with root and rind" and are mechanics, not mere flavor. The villagers' joining chorus at the end confirms the method's communal dimension. Removing the songs would break the remedy's logic. Strong integration across setup, multiple beats, and closure. Docked slightly because the songs work without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Verdant arbor at dawn (setting) is established in the opening line and reappears in several beats (woven platform, heartwood, arbor's base, vines thickening). It provides spatial anchors and the vine tendril's origin. However, the arbor does not constrain Elowen's choices or alter tactics; the platform's height and the arbor's structure are described but not functional. The thickening vines at the end signal healing but do not charge the closure image with new pressure. Present across beats but replaceable with minor edits—"sacred grove" or "ancient tree" would serve similarly. Mid-5s; functional postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "when everything aligns" is named in the opening, reiterated in paragraphs seventeen and thirty-two, and governs the remedy's possibility (harvest moon setting as sun crests). The alignment imposes a window that Elowen must meet, creating some urgency. However, the clock is not live on the page; we do not see Elowen racing it or adjusting for lost time. The alignment happens as expected and the spare tendril in her pocket suggests future alignments are available, reducing this one's uniqueness. Setup and closure presence met; development weak. Mid-6s for thematic frame without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to restore sacred practices" is stated in paragraph six ("driven by a fierce motivation"), recalled in paragraph fourteen ("beneath her whimsy burned resolve"), and dramatized through her toil and singing. It shapes her goal throughout and the closure confirms success. However, the motivation is told more than shown; no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost tests her commitment. Her whimsy and resolve coexist without contradiction. Present and causal but not conflicted or charged with visible sacrifice. Mid-6s for clear presence without dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone "gathering hush" appears in the opening line, reappears in paragraph nine ("the hushed air"), deepens in paragraph twenty-seven ("the hush deepening as if the arbor itself listened"), and lifts in paragraph thirty-six ("the gathering hush lifted into murmurs of thanks"). The tone modulates from stillness to communal voice, supporting the arc. However, the hush is asserted more than embodied in rhythm or syntax; the prose remains uniformly lyric and elevated rather than tightening under pressure. The final line's return to "hush" charges the ending but feels mechanical. Mid-6s for coherent presence without rhythmic deepening.</comment>
