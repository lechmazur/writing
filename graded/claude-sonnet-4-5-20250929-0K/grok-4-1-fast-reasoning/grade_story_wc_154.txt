<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft meaning onto old wounds is established through her brother's death, and the decryption sequence offers micro-choices. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final whispered promise feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Kael remains passive throughout, reducing relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN early and accumulates pressure through the decryption beats, reaching closure when Elara unknots the string and whispers her vow. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting shared anxieties into tentative peace. Cost is implied ("their anxieties no longer solitary knots") but the exact sacrifice or foreclosed path remains abstract—no visible trade-off on the page weakens the closure's bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early with vivid sensory detail (crashing waves, fading skylights, seeping mist). The brain coral fragment is handled twice and its labyrinthine ridges anchor tactile specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The setting charges the final image but does not drive a turn, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypting the child's fears to graft new meaning) is signaled early. The decryption sequence provides one meaningful deepening: each revelation ("Mama's shadow," "Coral brain dreams," "Untie me") layers anxieties and tightens emotional pressure. The unknotting of the string is a micro turn, but agency is interpretive work rather than a decision with visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the whispered vow asserts resolution without demonstrating cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (shared trauma reweaving into connection) emerges through the decryption particulars and the coral/knot motifs. The final image—two figures holding coral, unscarred and whole—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "lotus-hearted ache" and "grafting new meaning" are repeated thematic labels that border on statement. The piece resists false equivalence (trauma is specific, not symmetric) and the ending reweights prior material, though the whispered answer ("we unknot the shadows side by side") leans slightly toward articulation rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, poetic register ("lotus-hearted threnody," "pacific resolve," "tentative peace") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Key phrases ("shrewdly innocent," "grafting new meaning") recur as labels without evolving through pressure. Elara's perceptual signature—translator's ear, methodical tracing—is present but undercut by uniform lyric texture that does not modulate with urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("bruised silvers," "lotus-hearted threnody," "quiet alchemy of understanding"). This creates rhythmic beauty but flattens propulsion in peak beats where clarity would serve better. Paraphrase loops appear: "shared anxieties" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure; "grafted new meaning" and "lotus-hearted ache" are restated rather than advanced. Template cadence in the decryption sequence (First revelation:... Deeper still,... The final cluster...) reads mechanical. Artifact density and overwriting in closure beats trigger cumulative penalty and disallow 9+ globally per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core synthesis—translator decrypting a child's trauma through cast notes and coral—is specific and purposeful. The emotional arc (survivor grafting hope from shared wounds) transforms familiar recovery material through the patois cipher and reef-bombing context. However, the frame echoes therapeutic narrative templates (processing trauma, finding connection) without a sharp moral calculus or non-obvious turn. The final image (two figures holding coral, unscarred) is earnest but predictable given the setup. Risk-averse execution avoids bold structural choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (pacific translator) is present throughout and makes choices: feigning curiosity to buy time, methodically decrypting the cast, unknotting the string, whispering her vow. Setup and development gates are met. However, her agency is interpretive rather than high-stakes decision; no live option is foreclosed. Closure participation is present (she pockets the fragment and vows), but the cost is implied rather than visible. Two beats (decryption, unknotting) and closure linkage lift the score, but swappability (any empathetic adult could perform this role) and lack of visible trade-off cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment appears in setup (accepted from Kael's palm), is described with specificity ("labyrinthine ridges cool and brain-like"), recurs in the decryption beats (the cast's symbols mimic its folds), and Elara pockets it at closure with a vow. Three beats and closure participation are present. The object's specific properties (folds as cipher key) shape the decryption method, adding causal pressure. However, the fragment itself does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elara could decrypt without it. Purposeful reprise and symbolic charge are strong, but irreplaceability is partial.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (abandonment, bombs, sinking) are established through the decryption revelations and explicitly tied to both Kael's and Elara's fears. The concept shapes the dominant stake (unknotting shared trauma) and is present in setup, development, and closure. However, it functions primarily as thematic frame rather than on-page constraint; no choice is narrowed by the specific nature of the shared anxieties. The whispered ending ("we unknot the shadows side by side") articulates the concept but does not dramatize its cost. Two beats and closure linkage, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears twice as a label ("known for her shrewdly innocent gaze"; "Shrewdly innocent, she feigned playful curiosity"). The trait enables one action (feigning curiosity to buy time alone), satisfying development. However, the attribute is told rather than shown through distinct behavior, and no visible cost or trade-off is tied to it. Setup is present, closure participation absent. The trait could be replaced with "resourceful" or "disarming" without structural change. Label-only use and swappability cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" recurs structurally: the cipher itself ("unknotted under her gaze"), the literal string unknotting around the cast, and the final vow ("we unknot the shadows side by side"). Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. The action drives two beats (decryption completion, string removal revealing the hidden drawing) and charges the final image. However, the unknotting is interpretive work rather than a high-stakes physical act with visible cost. Causal pressure is present but the action could be replaced with "decipher" or "unravel" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The method (decrypting smudged notes on cast) is signaled early ("Kael's cast became her map, its smudged notes a cipher") and structures the middle beats. Elara's translator's ear and cross-referencing of tidal patterns/folk rhymes add specificity. Setup and development gates are met; the method shapes two beats (tracing, revelation cluster). However, the mechanics remain vague (how do tidal patterns unlock patois symbols?), and the method does not impose visible constraint or cost. Closure participation is weak: the string unknots smoothly with no resistance tied to the decryption skill. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight is established in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph ("The atrium's mist swirled onward"). Setup and closure participation are present. Sensory detail (fading skylights, distant waves, seeping mist) is vivid. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The arches and skylights do not shape Elara's decryption or the unknotting. Micro-setting (the body, coral fragment) does more work than the atrium itself. Lyric reprise without middle development or causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the anesthetic kicks in") is signaled when Kael's frame slackens and his eyes flutter. The child's unconsciousness creates opportunity for Elara's work without interruption. However, time is not tracked or pressured; no clock narrows her window. The phrase "before I sink" echoes temporal urgency but applies to Kael's internal fear, not scene time. Setup is present, but development and closure do not engage the timeframe as constraint. The anesthetic state is functional setup but swappable (any private moment would work). Missing development and closure gates cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") is established early and explicitly tied to Elara's brother's death. It drives her choice to stay with Kael, decode the cast, and whisper the vow. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. The motivation shapes three beats (staying, decrypting, vowing). However, the desire is told more than dramatized; we do not see internal friction or competing wants. The final act (whispering) fulfills the stated goal without visible sacrifice or trade-off. Functional across beats but lacks embodied conflict or cost that would lift it into high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" recurs four times, framing the emotional register. Tone is coherent and modulates from "low ache of distant waves" through "tears grafting new meaning" to "tentative peace." Setup and closure participation are present. However, the phrase functions as label rather than embodied texture; the ache is asserted, not felt through rhythm or sensory degradation. Tone does not shift with escalation (decoder urgency, string resistance). The final image is gentle and consistent but does not charge or complicate the established mood. Lyric consistency without tonal turn caps the score mid-band.</comment>
