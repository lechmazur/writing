<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life shows purposeful contradiction—guilt over noticing but not acting on the bakery's decline coexists with his guerrilla-gardening dedication—but the resolution with Mira arrives via her sudden appearance rather than a choice forged under pressure. The "I forgive you" moment feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized friction between them on the page. Embodiment is present (bread-breaking, tea-pouring) but much interiority leans on abstract metaphor ("yeast ghosts whispering of persistence") instead of grounded sensory stakes. The climactic reconciliation lacks visible cost; both siblings exit unchanged in their core stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles motifs (bread, tea house, courtyard, frost) and reaches closure when Mira's "I forgive you" and their vow to tend the garden together constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited option or action. Mira's arrival is coincidental, not motivated by prior causality, and her confession ("I noticed the bakery gone months ago") does not tighten choices—it only echoes Elias's guilt. The final image ("birds would return; so would small wonders") reweights prior material but without a visible price paid on the page, weakening the closure's grip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard and tea house constrain Elias's choices (sowing seeds, coaxing vines) and charge the final image of shared gardening. Spatial choreography is clear (gates, pavilion, scarred table) and frost etches a tonal anchor. However, the palace itself remains a postcard backdrop—its decay is described but does not complicate access, supply a resource under pressure, or force a tactical tradeoff in the peak beat. The body and bread as micro-setting qualify, but the courtyard does not escalate conflict beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding absolution for noticing but not acting on creeping normality—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. Mira's arrival and forgiveness occur without resistance or negotiation; Elias does not renounce a path, endure visible cost, or make a choice that narrows options. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens; the garden vow is additive rather than a transformation forged under pressure. Coincidence delivers the resolution rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Creeping normality" and "finding the sacred in the ordinary" emerge through specific images (bread, guerrilla garden, frost) rather than abstract philosophizing, and the final image (birds returning, small wonders) reweights prior material without moralizing. However, phrases like "the sacred ordinary pulsing anew" and "yeast ghosts whispering of persistence" veer close to thematic echo, and the ending answers the central question too neatly—redemption through shared gardening—without earned ambiguity or cost. The piece resists tidy morals but leans on prompt-like language in key beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; distance is controlled and perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") colors his observations. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that clashes with embodied action: "heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution," "sacralized by memory," "creeping normality had lulled him too." These academic-leaning constructions accumulate across peak beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue between Elias and Mira is functional but lacks distinct idiom; their speech could be swapped with minor edits. No head-hopping, but voice specificity under pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries metaphoric density ("frost etched the leaves silver," "steam curl like confessions") and some vivid particulars (solar-heated brazier, chipped pot), but suffers from scaffold loops, template cadence, and register drift. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "creeping normality had lulled him too" immediately follows his reflection on the same concept. Runs of identical stems ("He ate slowly… He poured… He watched") create drumbeat rhythm. Stock phrases ("yeast ghosts," "fertile canvas," "small salvations") cluster in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stacks ("He saw potential," "He felt it settle") dull immediacy. Figurative language in most sentences of the reconciliation beat—without pattern-teaching or payoff—triggers overwriting penalties. These artifacts touch the closure image ("the sacred ordinary pulsing anew"), disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The guerrilla-gardening premise and "creeping normality noticer" frame offer a fresh synthesis, and the palace courtyard as salvaged haven is specific. However, the emotional arc—estranged siblings reconciling over shared loss and a vow to nurture something together—follows a widely used template without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or a lived-in complication. The bread and tea house motifs are purposeful but not irreplaceable; swap them for another shared relic and the arc holds unchanged. No bold risk in structure or perspective; the piece plays safe within its chosen mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is identified early as a "creeping normality noticer" and his observation drives his guilt and motivation, but his noticing does not create a key turn—it remains background context. His decision to share bread with Mira is reactive (she arrives), not a choice forged by his noticing trait. The trait shapes theme but does not alter on-page tactics or foreclose a path with cost. Functional but replaceable; missing middle development and closure participation gates. Cap 4.6 for post-setup absence; swappability and ornamental use lower further to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bread appears in three beats: Elias unwraps and breaks it, offers it to Mira, and they consume it together while reflecting on their parents' bakery. Its "scent rose, earthy and nostalgic" anchors memory and the act of sharing bridges estrangement, tying it to closure. However, the bread does not constrain a choice or force a tactical tradeoff; it remains a symbolic vessel rather than a causal lever. Setup, development (shared consumption), and payoff (dwindles between them) gates are met, but causal pressure is weak. Strong lyric reprise and beat involvement lift it to 6.8, but lack of cost connection prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly ("In the bread's soft heart, he sought tenuous absolution") and Mira's whispered "I forgive you" delivers it at closure. The concept shapes the dominant stake (Elias's guilt) and the ending's emotional charge. However, the absolution is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The element frames theme but does not change on-page options under pressure. Setup, closure participation gates met; missing middle development. Cap 4.6; thematic linkage and closure mention lift to 5.9, but lack of causal pressure and cost prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears once ("Heuristically gentle in his ways, he moved with intuitive care, avoiding brittle twigs") and informs his tea-pouring gesture, but the trait does not constrain or enable a pivotal action with visible cost. The descriptor is label-only; swap "careful" or "deliberate" and the arc holds. Setup gate met, but missing middle development and closure participation. Cap 4.6 for post-setup absence; swappability and label-only use lower to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: the tea house is "uncloaked only to those who truly looked," and Mira "uncloaking truths in the tea house's glow." The verb ties to revelation and the reconciliation, but the action is metaphorical rather than physical—no literal unveiling drives a turn. Easily swappable with "reveal" or "disclose." Setup and closure participation gates met; missing middle development as a distinct beat. Cap 4.6; thematic linkage lifts to 5.1, but swappability and lack of causal pressure prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early ("sowing seeds in midnight hours, nurturing lettuce and lavender amid the weeds") and its harvest (nettle tea, mint) supplies the tea-house encounter. The mechanics shape Elias's motivation and the courtyard setting, and the vow to "tend the garden together" ties it to closure. However, the method does not constrain a middle choice or force a tactical tradeoff under pressure; it remains background context. Setup, development (harvest use), and payoff (shared vow) gates met. Beat involvement (setup, harvest, vow) and closure linkage lift to 6.4, but lack of causal pressure in a contested beat prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is established early, provides the encounter space with Mira, and its woven branches and scarred table anchor the reconciliation. The setting supplies resources (solar-heated brazier, nettle tea) and its hidden, reclaimed nature mirrors the thematic arc. The vow to "tend the garden together" charges the final image and reconfigures the space's meaning from solitary refuge to shared project. Setup, development (encounter space), and payoff (reconfigured promise) gates met. Causal pressure (supplies the encounter), closure linkage, and beat involvement across three distinct moments earn 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the birds flew south" opens the piece and "The birds would return" closes it, creating a seasonal frame (autumn into winter, frost present). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; months pass between the bakery's closure and this evening without tactical pressure. The element is ornamental atmosphere rather than a constraint. Setup and payoff gates met (frame), but missing middle development. Cap 4.6 for post-setup absence; ornamental use and lack of urgency lower to 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated explicitly ("his motivation had burned quiet: to find the sacred in the ordinary") and dramatized through guerrilla gardening, bread-breaking ritual, and the tea house. The desire drives Elias's actions and the piece's thematic spine. However, the motivation does not face on-page friction or force a costly choice—Mira's arrival and forgiveness fulfill rather than complicate it. Setup, development (ritual actions), and payoff (garden vow) gates met. Beat involvement and thematic coherence lift to 6.2, but lack of dramatized conflict between want and cost prevents higher.</comment>
