<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established—rescue Theo's promise—but her interior life relies heavily on abstracted emotional labels ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The journey through the archive shows goal pursuit, but pivotal moments like discovering the vandalized portrait or the final vault lean on summary ("tears carving paths") instead of embodied decisions under pressure. The final collapse beside the sculpture feels like emotional release rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority at peak beats uses therapy-adjacent phrasing ("grief into searing focus") that distances rather than inhabits crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, underground archive, post-arson) and follows a clear causal trail: figurine → murals → portrait → tapestry → vault. However, the closure—Elara collapsing beside the sculpture and deciding to "portray it all anew"—lands as Earned Stasis but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or visible sacrifice makes the "before/after" legible with felt weight. The vandalized portrait functions as a micro turn (coordinates hidden beneath slashes), but the vault discovery resolves without a choice that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. Drive lens reads Causal through the middle, but the ending shifts toward Accumulative without teaching that pattern early, creating lens drift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly rendered with dust, rubble, humid air, and aged wool, and the spatial trail (corridor, mural chamber, pedestal, spiral stairwell, vault) tracks clearly. The vandalized portrait's slashed gashes and the tapestry fragment's metallic threads provide tactile, purposeful detail that drives Elara's choices. The archive's inaccessibility ("off the grid") constrains her isolation and charges the final vault discovery. However, the setting does not impose a meaningful obstacle or resource scarcity that alters tactics at closure; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfill Theo's promise to preserve the archive's knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. The trail of artistic creations provides a sequence of discoveries that tighten focus, and the vandalized portrait moment ("piecing the slashes like a puzzle") narrows her path. Yet escalation relies on revelation rather than rising opposition; once Elara finds each clue, the next appears without cost or trade-off. The vault discovery resolves the quest but no on-page choice at closure forces her to sacrifice an alternative path or endure a visible price. Agency at the end is renunciation of arson-fueled destruction in favor of guardianship, but the shift is told ("her volcanic tenderness a hearth now") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation versus destruction, love as motive for both—emerges through Elara's arson and subsequent guardianship, and the recurring "portray" motif threads the narrative. However, the final lines ("The arsonist had become guardian," "threads of fate binding past to her unyielding heart") state the theme rather than allowing the sculpture and tapestry to carry it silently. The vandalized self-portrait offers a charged image, but its meaning is explained ("hiding deeper truth") instead of left to accumulate. Emotional honesty is undercut by abstract phrases like "volcanic tenderness exploding like lava kissing the sea," which reach for profundity but land as ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (pattern recognition, grief-driven focus) colors her observations. Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "fingers entwined like roots in ancient soil" establishing a lyric register. However, during peak emotional beats—discovering the portrait, entering the vault—the prose shifts into declarative summary ("tears carving paths," "tenderness exploding") that tells emotion rather than inhabiting it through syntax or rhythm. No dialogue appears on the page. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the voice leans heavily on metaphor in every paragraph, creating a uniform texture that flattens rather than modulates under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language, but metaphor appears in nearly every sentence without purposeful variation, creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls momentum ("volcanic tenderness," "erupting in quiet sobs," "exploding like lava"). Paraphrase loops occur: "trailing… trail of artistic creations begging to be chased" and "portray… portraying… portrayed" cycle without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She had [verb]" opens multiple beats. Peak moments rely on filter-verb stacks ("her breath hitched, tears carving paths") instead of direct image. The final paragraph's moralizing summary ("The arsonist had become guardian") replaces scene pressure with thematic statement. These artifacts spread across the story, touching the closure beat and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist follows dead lover's art trail through underground archive—offers a non-obvious synthesis of treasure hunt and grief, and the vandalized self-portrait as puzzle is a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (destruction → preservation) follows a familiar redemption template without transformation through specific lived cost. The archive and artistic clues feel generic (figurine, murals, tapestry) rather than irreplaceable to this character and world; swapping them for other art forms would leave the plot intact. The ending's guardianship turn is foreshadowed heavily, reducing surprise, and the final lines retreat into abstraction ("threads of fate") rather than a concrete, durable image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (lending library arsonist) appears in every beat and her past arson frames her motive. Her choices—following the figurine's arrow, piecing the portrait's slashes, descending the stairwell—drive the sequence. However, these are more discoveries than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. At closure she becomes guardian, but the shift is summarized rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) and drives two beats (portrait puzzle, vault entry), but causal pressure and cost are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears mid-story (spiral stairwell descent), is handled on the page ("clutching the fragment"), and its hidden map drives the vault discovery. It returns at closure as the knowledge she will "portray… anew," reweighting preservation. Present in two beats (discovery, map-following) and shapes the ending, but late first appearance (~60% mark) and the fragment itself does not constrain a prior choice or impose cost—it solves rather than complicates. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift it, but swappability (any relic could carry a map) and late entry limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait appears mid-story (~45% mark) and provides the coordinates that unlock the spiral stairwell, creating one key turn. However, the concept of vandalized self-portrait (art as both wound and clue) is explained rather than used; Elara interprets it ("hiding deeper truth") but the portrait itself does not constrain her tactics or recur at closure. Present in one beat (middle development) and absent from the ending, limiting integration to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is stated twice in exposition ("honed her analytically intuitive mind," "eyes… analytically intuitive as hers") but never demonstrated through a specific on-page action where analysis enables or constrains a choice with cost. The trait is label-only. The portrait-puzzle moment could showcase it, but the leap from slashes to coordinates is told rather than shown as a process. Ornamental use without causal pressure or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Portray" recurs throughout: Theo's promise ("portray the truth"), the murals "portraying the lost civilization's rise," Elara's memory ("portrayed him… a thousand times"), the tapestry "portraying the civilization's final rite," and the ending ("began to portray it all anew"). It threads the narrative and charges the closure image, but the action itself is not performed on the page during a pressure beat—it is remembered, described, or intended. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but swappable (e.g., "preserve," "record") without structural loss. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-6s territory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations—figurine, murals, portrait, tapestry—is signaled early ("spotted the first artistic creation") and structures the entire quest. Each piece drives a beat: figurine points east, murals gesture toward cracks, portrait hides coordinates, tapestry reveals the map. The method is taught by the first third and its mechanics (following directional cues, decoding slashes) matter to each move. Present across all three gates, drives three beats, and shapes closure (vault discovery). Causal pressure is strong, but the trail itself does not impose a cost or friction—each clue is solved on discovery. High beat involvement and closure linkage earn the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is named in the opening, provides spatial structure (chambers, corridors, stairwell, vault), and its "off the grid" inaccessibility isolates Elara, framing her months-long focus. The archive's dust, rubble, and humidity are described, and its layout constrains her path (she must follow the trail room by room). However, the setting does not impose resource scarcity or obstacle that alters her tactics; she moves through it without friction. Present in all three gates and involved in every beat, but functions more as backdrop than active pressure. Early signal and beat involvement lift it, but lack of constraint limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the opening and "months off the grid" signals duration, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. The quest proceeds without a clock; no urgency, deadline, or resource depletion forces trade-offs. The past (Theo's promise, the arson) frames motive, but the present action is not time-pressured. Functional setup but no middle development or closure participation. Replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—rescue Theo's forgotten promise—is stated early ("whose forgotten promise she had come to rescue"), drives every beat (following the trail to fulfill his vow), and lands at closure (she has "rescued the promise"). The flashback to his whispered request grounds the desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no on-page moment tests whether she might abandon the quest or choose an alternative path. Desire is told ("volcanic tenderness burned") rather than dramatized through friction between want and cost. Present across all three gates and drives the arc, but lacks dramatized conflict, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears in multiple beats ("volcanic tenderness burned," "volcanic tenderness surged," "volcanic tenderness exploding," "volcanic tenderness a hearth") and attempts to unify grief and intensity. The tone is consistent but static—each use asserts the same emotional register without modulation. The final reprise ("a hearth now") shifts from active to passive, reweighting slightly, but the phrase functions as a repeated label rather than a tonal inflection that charges the ending through rhythm or image. Setup and payoff present, but ornamental and swappable with other metaphors. Lyric reprise lifts it into the 5s.</comment>
