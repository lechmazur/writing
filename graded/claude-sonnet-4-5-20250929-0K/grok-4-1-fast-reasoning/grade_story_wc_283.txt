<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is declared ("to spin this prophecy into raw possibility") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. His interior reads as poetic narration—"quietly inspired" appears as a repeated label—without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The button-cataloging sequence offers no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; he proceeds methodically without friction or cost until the final hourglass turn, which arrives as assertion rather than earned change. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Elias), where (amber warehouse), and when (tonight) within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. Under an Accumulative lens, the cataloging beats layer images and the jar's echo clarifies from "scrambled" to "harmonious counsel," achieving a pattern shift. However, the closure—turning the hourglass to "invert the flow" and "liberate" the prophecy—is declared rather than shown with visible cost on the page; the sands reverse, the jar is corked, and consequences are asserted ("fates no longer foreclosed") without on-page proof that options have changed or a path has been foreclosed. The final climb with the jar offers a gesture of intent, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly anchored early with layered sensory detail (glowing chunks, lantern light "like trapped fireflies," scarred workbench). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting supplies the buttons and jar that Elias uses. The cliffs frame the opening and closing, and the warehouse "sighs" as the prophecy loosens, charging the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias's cataloging proceeds without spatial obstacle or material limit—so Q3 cannot reach the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the prophecy from rigid fate—is signaled early. However, pressure never tightens: Elias encounters no opposition, no failed attempt, no cost that alters his tactics. The button-cataloging sequence accumulates information without reversal or complication, and the hourglass turn at the end is executed without friction. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, but escalation requires a meaningful deepening or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here, the prophecy simply clarifies and Elias proceeds to resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—choice versus fate, isolation versus shared wisdom—emerges from the cataloged buttons and the echo's transformation rather than overt statement. The final image of the "open hand" button and the canyon's "clear, shared song" offers a resonant answer to the premise without moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("shared wisdom," "quietly inspired") and the ending asserts potential ("fates no longer foreclosed") rather than showing a credible trade-off or ambiguity. The wisdom feels declared rather than earned through Elias's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elaborate metaphor ("clawed at the sky," "time's fragile pulse," "collective murmurs...fossilized into prophecy"). However, figurative density is high across most beats without tonal modulation under pressure, and the voice remains uniform in register from opening to closure—no shift in psychic distance or cadence to reflect Elias's emotional arc. Perceptual signature is poetic but not character-particular; the diction would fit any contemplative narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated diction ("unearthed silence," "hoarded dreams of ancient seas," "time's cruel knot"), reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("prophecy chained the future, a rigid fate" / "prophecy's rigid form into raw possibility"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He lifted it... He knew this echo... His motivation burned clear... Quietly inspired, he sought"). The final paragraph stacks assertions without scene grounding ("fates no longer foreclosed," "possibilities cataloged eternally"). Information density is low; many lines restate theme rather than advance causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise—hourglass turner unscrambles a canyon-echo prophecy by cataloging amber-trapped buttons—offers a distinctive synthesis of elements. However, the emotional arc (isolation to shared wisdom, rigid fate to raw possibility) follows a template trajectory without complication or moral ambiguity. The buttons' runes and the echo's clarification proceed without false starts or competing interpretations. The piece commits to its lyric frame but retreats from bold risk; no character flaw costs Elias, no prophecy resists him, and the ending grants full success without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's role as hourglass turner frames the premise and he performs the climactic act (inverting the master hourglass). However, his choices are procedural—uncover jar, catalog buttons, turn glass—without friction or trade-off. He is present across beats and his final action shapes the ending, but the decisions do not alter tactics or foreclose a path; he proceeds as planned.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in the inciting beat (uncovered in amber dust), its echo spills "scrambled voices" and later clarifies to "harmonious counsel," and Elias carries it at closure. Three distinct touches across setup, middle, and ending, with reweighted meaning (scramble → clarity). However, handling is passive—he lifts it, listens, corks it—without the jar constraining a choice or imposing cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is named explicitly ("the echo held shared wisdom, the collective murmurs of canyon sages") and recurs as thematic gloss ("shared wisdom unfolded," "carry this shared wisdom upward"). It flavors the ending image ("clear, shared song") but does not shape on-page tactics or force a choice between competing goods. Present as theme, not as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears as a label four times ("quiet inspiration stir," "Quietly inspired, he sought," "quietly inspired, he grasped," "his quiet inspiration now the world's quiet dawn") but never constrains or enables a visible action with cost. It decorates his internal state without generating friction or altering his approach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unscramble" drives the middle sequence: Elias draws buttons, matches glyphs to the echo's pulses, and the prophecy clarifies from "doom sands the cliffs eternal" to "divergence—cliffs could stand or shift." The action is present in setup (jar spills "scrambled voices"), developed (button catalog yields clarity), and referenced at closure ("sealed the unscrambling"). Functional across beats, but swappable—any decoding method could serve the same plot role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cataloging buttons is signaled early ("by cataloging lost buttons"), occupies the middle beats with specific detail (brass, pearlized disc, silver), and yields the pattern that unlocks the prophecy. Three beats: method introduced, executed with concrete props, and sealed with the final button. Mechanics matter (glyphs match echo pulses), but the process encounters no resistance or alternate interpretation, so causality is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is anchored in the opening paragraph and supplies the buttons and jar. Elias moves through it, clears a workbench, and the walls "shimmer" as the prophecy loosens. Present in setup, middle (workbench), and ending (warehouse settles). However, the setting does not constrain choice—space is permissive, tools are available—so it remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As the truth began to unravel" appears in the opening third, "Tonight" anchors the sequence, and "dawn's first light" marks the ending. Time is present but loose; no clock tightens Elias's moves, and the pacing is contemplative rather than urgent. The unraveling metaphor flavors tone without imposing deadline pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation is declared explicitly ("His motivation burned clear: to spin this prophecy into raw possibility, freeing its strands") and drives the plot arc from discovering the jar to turning the hourglass. Present in setup, pursued through cataloging, and fulfilled at closure. However, it is told rather than shown in micro-choices; no friction appears between want and cost, so the desire reads as mission statement rather than dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" appears in the opening line, recurs midpoint ("In the unearthed silence, Elias vowed"), and closes the second-to-last paragraph ("the warehouse settled into deeper silence"). The tone is contemplative and lyric throughout, with no sharp modulation under pressure. The phrase charges the final image by repetition but remains a static mood rather than a tone that shifts with escalation.</comment>
