<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and sensitivity are established, but her interior remains abstract through much of the piece ("ambition burned like hidden sap"). The final turn—achieving serenity through endurance—is asserted rather than earned by contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied detail appears ("nose aflame," "gagged, vision blurring") but is buried in overwritten texture; the protagonist's choices feel preordained by thematic agenda rather than dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "who" (Elara), "where" (treetop village), and "when" (dawn/tide turning) anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric elements. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (serenity as poise within sway), but the cost is told ("her path forever scented") rather than shown in a decisive on-page forfeit or reweighted image. The Orientation Test penalty does not apply here; −0.3 in Q2 once for lens clarity drift (the piece wavers between causal ambition-plot and lyric meditation without fully committing until the end). Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The treetop village and tidal rhythms provide vivid anchoring ("platforms heaving like breath," "hammock-homes suspended like wildflower pods"). Sensory detail leans heavily visual and olfactory, appropriate to the POV. The corpse flower's bloom constrains Elara's choice to endure, satisfying the 9+ gate minimally; however, the setting remains largely backdrop rather than shaping tactics at key turns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate serenity amid motion) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the bloom's stench forces endurance, but this is more situational test than escalation driven by protagonist agency. The cost—collapsing to her knees, then rising with transformed perspective—reads as symbolic survival rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. Pressure coheres but does not meaningfully narrow options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (decay fueling rebirth, serenity as poise within flux) emerges through motifs but is over-articulated in the final third ("serenity not as stillness, but poise within sway"). The ending offers a resonant image (villagers inhaling the lesson, journals carrying secrets into lore) but the non-literal answer is diluted by near-moralizing summary. Thematic echo penalty: −0.5 for prompt-like phrasing ("impermanence births peace") in the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person with consistent focalization through Elara. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("wildflower hush of dawn," "titan petal pulsing under moonlight") and abstract labels ("ambition gnawed," "wisdom flowed"). Register drift is mild but persistent; the voice reads as curated rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears; interiority remains coherent but generic at emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern payoff ("hidden sap," "tidal wave crashing her awareness," "odor a tidal wave"). Template cadence runs ("Days blurred… her nose tracking… Yet she doodled… Villagers whispered… But Elara pressed on") span multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: "serenity eluded her" / "serenity meant blooming amid chaos" / "she had cultivated serenity." Baseline −1.2 in Q7 for density + coherence + template stems; artifacts touch closure beats, adding −0.5. Total artifact penalty −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The corpse-flower-as-wisdom premise is familiar from horticultural allegory templates. Execution leans on stock lyric moves (journals, treetop isolation, olfactory sensitivity) without transforming them through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The combination of elements feels prompted rather than inevitable. Derivative premise penalty: −0.8 for close match to template without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (ambitious herbalist) is present throughout and makes the choice to endure the bloom, but the decision is asserted in summary ("pressed on," "held fast") rather than dramatized in a turn that alters tactics. Two beats involve her agency (planting, enduring bloom); closure participation is present but ornamental. Setup + development gates met; payoff weak. Baseline 5.0; swappability −0.2 (any determined character could endure).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in three beats: unwrapping/planting (early), seedling growth (middle), and full bloom (climax). The bloom's stench forces Elara's endurance test, constraining her choice. Closure linkage is strong ("fading perfume as wisdom's echo"). Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.5; causal pressure +0.9; closure linkage +1.0; but the seed's specific properties (leathery husk, veins) are described rather than mechanically decisive, limiting irreplaceability. Swappability −0.3 (any foul-blooming plant could substitute). Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" is mentioned repeatedly as legend and theme ("undercurrent of wisdom emerged," "wisdom flowed—an undercurrent") but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. It functions as thematic gloss rather than a constraint or resource. Label-only use −0.3; summary-only −0.3. Missing middle development gate; cap 3.4. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's olfactory sensitivity ("olfactorily sensitive nose") enables her to track the seedling's exhales and experience the bloom's assault in granular detail. It constrains her at closure (the stench is a visceral trial). Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.0; causal pressure +0.6; but the trait is often label-only ("acute sense of smell") rather than shown in micro-choices with visible cost. Ornamental −0.4; swappability −0.3 (any sensitive character could suffer). Final: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Journalize" (doodling on wrapping paper) appears in three beats: unwrapping the seed, sketching during growth, and completing journals at closure. The action frames her process but does not drive major turns; she could cultivate serenity without the journals with minor plot edits. Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.0; beat involvement +0.9; but swappability is high (any reflective practice could substitute). Swappability −0.6; summary of journal completion −0.4. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors" is mentioned in setup and reappears in middle and closure beats as Elara's journaling method. The custom provides texture but does not constrain her choices; generic journaling would serve equally. Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.0; but swappability is extreme (any journaling format could replace it). Swappability −0.8; ornamental −0.6; late first detailed use (after planting) −0.3. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Whispercanopy (treetop village) is vividly established early and recurs in spatial beats (swaying walkways, platforms heaving). The village's motion mirrors and pressures Elara's quest for serenity, and the bloom occurs on her platform. Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.0; causal pressure +0.7 (motion complicates her task); closure linkage +0.4 (villagers gather at dawn). But the setting does not decisively alter tactics at key turns; swappability −0.4 (any precarious environment could substitute). Final: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" is introduced as a liminal hour at the opening and reprised at the bloom ("One eve at the tide's thought turning anew," "The turning tide thought receded"). The timeframe provides lyric cadence but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; "weeks passed" and "days blurred" flatten temporal pressure. Setup + payoff gates met; missing middle development (no on-page clock in escalation). Cap 3.4. Lyric reprise adds +0.5; late first mechanical use −0.3. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to cultivate serenity within motion") is stated early and recurs throughout. It drives her decision to plant the seed and endure the bloom, but the friction between want and cost is told rather than enacted in contradictory on-page choices. Setup + development + payoff gates met. Baseline 6.0; causal pressure +0.5; but summary dominates ("ambition burned," "serenity eluded her"). Summary-only −0.4; swappability −0.3 (any growth-via-ordeal motive could substitute). Final: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" appears in the opening line, recurs as a descriptor ("weeks passed in wildflower hush"), and closes the story ("her path forever scented by the wildflower hush"). Tone is lyric and contemplative, modulating slightly under the bloom's assault but remaining static through turns. Setup + payoff gates met; middle development weak (tone does not shift meaningfully during escalation). Cap 3.4 for missing development gate; lyric reprise at closure adds +0.8; coherence +0.5; but single static mood limits impact. Final: 5.3.</comment>
