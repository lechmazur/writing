<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover suppressed truth is clearly established, but his interior life consists largely of label-heavy exposition ("solemn duty," "searing pull," "motivation realized in the clutch of revelation"). The retrocognitive trap creates spectator status—"Elias-yet-not, compelled to witness"—draining agency from the peak beats. The debris-oath arrangement offers one meaningful micro-choice that earns the final release, lifting the score modestly, but contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene; the arc reads as externally imposed rather than earned through internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (shard structure, lyric density, pattern of debris-oaths). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardians release Elias after he proves lineage, and he awakens "ready to broadcast these truths," foreclosing spectator status with visible cost (the searing ordeal). However, orientation debt persists past 120 words—who Elias is, where the zeppelin floats, and the dune-folk uprising context remain vague until deep into the retrocognitive sequence. The two-shard structure (library → lagoon → library return) is legible, and the ending image reweights prior material, but the Orientation Test failure and causality gaps (how the diary triggers retrocognition, why debris-oaths bind spirits) apply −0.5 and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly sketched ("jagged shores where forgotten tides lapped," "vertebrae strung as a spine"), and the debris as setting-objects constrains the parley choice. However, orientation anchors arrive late and remain incomplete: we never learn the zeppelin's route, the dune-folk geography, or how the library floats. Spatial choreography in the lagoon is coherent, but the score is capped at 7.0 by the Q2 orientation penalty. Sensory detail leans visual; other senses are underutilized in the searing dune heat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover the purge's hidden toll—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias must prove lineage via debris-oath, narrowing his options under duress. The guardians' demand and his compliance constitute one meaningful turn, and the cost (eternal entrapment if he fails) is declared but only felt obliquely. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (searing visions, debris rearrangement) rather than because/therefore linkage. Agency is undercut by spectator framing ("compelled to witness," "trapped vision"), and the resolution hinges on spectral approval rather than protagonist decision, capping the band near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—the tension between official histories and silenced truths—emerges through the debris-oaths and visions rather than statement, and the final image ("obsidian lagoon's echoes would fuel archives unbound") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The recurring obsidian mirror/lagoon reweights meaning at closure. However, prompt-label echoes ("tension births truth," "civil rights hung by threads") intrude in the final third, and the ending paragraph's "dunes whispering justice to the winds" verges on thematic echo, applying −0.4. Emotional complexity is present but not deeply contradictory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, and the register aspires to heightened, antiquarian diction ("veils of time," "mist and unresolved grievances"). However, perceptual signature is generic across beats—every object receives equal lyric treatment—and psychic distance never modulates. The prose often slips into exposition that tells rather than anchors in Elias's concrete perception ("his motivation to pierce the tension," "demanding parley for the truths he sought"). Filter verbs ("he knew," "he absorbed") stack in the final third without voice-motivated justification, applying −0.5 in Q7 that bleeds here as distance flatness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("tension coiling like heat haze," "wind-wraiths," "searing pull," "spectral pulse"), and much of it lands cleanly, but runs of template cadence appear: "The guardians hovered… The guardians nodded," "Elias's fingers… Elias's heart… Elias absorbed," triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("truths long buried" / "truths he sought" / "truths forever veiled" / "broadcast these truths") add −0.3. Label-heavy interiority ("solemn duty," "motivation realized") and therapy-speak ("unresolved grievances") in peak beats add −0.4. Total artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7, and the final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—retrocognitive archival work via encrypted diary and debris parley—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative elements, and the debris-as-language turn is inventive. However, the emotional arc (solitary seeker undergoes ordeal, earns truth, returns committed) is a recognizable template, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail that feels irreplaceable. The worldbuilding (floating library, dune-folk uprising, zeppelin overlords) reads competent but not deeply inhabited. No proximity to famous lines detected; the derivative premise guardrail applies −0.5 for template reliance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias frames the story and makes the diary-unlocking choice that triggers the retrocognitive trap, then arranges debris-oaths to prove lineage—two functional beats. However, the peak choice is externally compelled ("compelled to witness," guardians "demanding parley"), and his agency reads as response rather than decision-shaping key turns. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with any truth-seeking archivist. Mid-band capped by replaceability and observer stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is the spatial and symbolic heart: discovered mid-story, it hosts the parley, supplies debris for the oath, and "seals beneath reforming sands" at closure, bracketing the retrocognitive ordeal. Its properties (glassy stillness, sacred to dune-folk, ringed by debris) constrain the parley method and charge the final image. Three distinct beats (reveal, oath site, seal) and strong closure linkage, but introduced after the first third (−0.3 late penalty) and the mechanics of why debris-oaths bind the guardians remain unexplained, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery is the inciting incident: Elias unlocks it, triggering the retrocognitive trap that drives the entire middle sequence. Its sigils match the debris-oaths at closure, reweighting the diary's role and enabling the final broadcast clarity. Three gates (setup, middle trap, ending validation) are met, and removing it breaks the plot. However, the diary itself is passive after the first beat—its encrypted nature never constrains later choices; the trap does the causal work. Functional across beats but the object's encryption is ornamental post-trigger.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Retrocognitive entrapment shapes every middle beat: Elias is "compelled to witness," cannot speak (forcing debris arrangement), and faces "eternal entrapment" if he fails the parley, directly raising stakes and altering tactics. The trait is introduced early, drives the obstacle (voicelessness → debris method), and resolves at closure when the guardians release him. Cost is visible (the ordeal, dual-timeline pulse). All three gates plus causal pressure, but the trait is declarative rather than embodied through perceptual degradation or contradictory impulses, capping the high band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Parley with the spectral guardians is the central action: they encircle him, demand proof, Elias arranges debris twice (plea, then oath sigil), they reply and ignite visions, then release him. The action shapes tactics (debris language), escalates stakes (eternal trap), and gates the closure (release enables awakening and broadcast). Present across three beats and indispensable to structure. However, the guardians' decision to release feels resolved by compliance rather than contested negotiation, reducing peak tension and capping just below 8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is taught early ("ancients' method"), executed twice on the page (plea: bones/hull/shells; oath: vertebrae/wire/pebbles), and each arrangement drives guardian response, making the method causal. It appears in setup (taught), middle (dual use), and payoff (oath releases him). Specific debris choices (vertebrae as spine, wire as vows) show purposeful selection. However, the method arrives only after voicelessness is imposed—it does not shape earlier attempts—and the mechanics of why debris binds spirits are asserted, not explored, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin brackets the story (opening desk scene, closing awakening) and supplies the inciting object (diary). Its "gentle sway" and "lamplight" offer atmospheric anchors, but the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The library could be any archive; the zeppelin could be any isolated location. The final paragraph's "zeppelin's shadow trailed over the wastes" is a charged image, but the vehicle itself remains ornamental. Present in setup and ending but purely descriptive in development, capping mid-low per the swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the letters are found" anchors the opening ("unearthed… just hours before") and the ending ("awakening drenched"), but the intervening retrocognitive sequence operates in dual time without live urgency. No clock tightens the parley; the guardians' patience is infinite until Elias completes the oath. The element is present in setup and payoff but passive in development—time does not narrow options or escalate cost. Introduced early but lacks middle development, applying the missing-middle cap at 3.4; mild closure participation (awakening marks return) lifts slightly to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth in tension is stated early ("pierce the tension between official histories and raw scars"), drives the diary unlock and retrocognitive journey, and crystallizes at closure ("broadcast these truths into tense skies"). The tension is dramatized through the guardians' demand and Elias's ordeal. However, the motivation is more told than enacted—Elias never weighs competing costs or betrays contradictory impulses; the friction is external (guardians resist) rather than internal (desire vs. fear). Present across all three gates with causal role, but lacks embodied conflict, capping near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Searing reverie is coherent throughout: heightened, antiquarian diction ("solemn," "spectral," "obsidian," "scorching," "searing") pervades every beat, and the tone modulates minimally from desk contemplation to dune ordeal to lamplight resolve. The register never breaks, and the final image ("obsidian lagoon's echoes… dunes whispering justice") charges closure with the same lyric density. However, the tone is static—no tonal shift marks escalation—and the uniform elevation flattens urgency in peak beats. Coherent but monotone, landing mid-band for purposeful consistency without dynamic range.</comment>
