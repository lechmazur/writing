<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "coax wonder from routine" is clear and his jittery trait recurs, but interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("jittery nerves steadying with purpose") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("unspoken weariness, hidden dreams"). The exchange with Lira shows micro-choice (offering the pendant), but the character change reads more as thematic statement than embodied cost—"jittery no more" declares rather than dramatizes the shift. Thorne's backstory occupies substantial real estate without always tilting present choices, though it does prime the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the closure unit—Kael realizing his deliveries have woven Thorne's absence into legacy—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "Kael, the jittery courier, became the myth's next verse"). Cost is felt but somewhat abstract: no concrete path is foreclosed on the page, and the final image ("pressed on, coaxing the world awake") asserts transformation rather than showing a visible trade-off. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (auroral imagery, pendant motif, myth-building pattern), and it holds through closure, but the cost proof is oblique—more conceptual repricing than a tangible loss that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and recurs across beats, shaping spatial choreography (the fork, the pause, Lira's descent). Sensory detail is selective—"greens and purples," "rock into ethereal crystal"—and filtered through Kael's wonder-seeking lens. The pendant's interaction with aurora light charges the exchange with Lira, and the ridgeway's mist/wind/stone anchor memory of Thorne, satisfying the 9+ test for environment constraining choice and charging the final image. Micro-setting (pendant, puddle reflection) functions purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (coax wonder from routine), and the encounter with Lira provides one meaningful tightening: Kael's offer, Lira's shift from suspicion to promise. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin—the pendant's effect unfolds smoothly without forcing a trade-off or narrowing Kael's options. The "time warped; their brief encounter extended" moment deepens thematically but lacks visible cost (no stamina drain, no missed delivery, no social price paid). Agency is present (the offer) but the resolution feels preordained rather than tested by conflicting pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (wonder germinating from absence and routine) emerges through concrete particulars: the pendant's vibration, Lira's vision of auroral forges, Thorne's myth solidifying. The final image—"Kael, the jittery courier, became the myth's next verse"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, reweighting prior material (Thorne's vanishing, the courier lineage). Subtext operates in gesture (Kael's hand slipping to the pendant, Lira's widened eyes). Minor slip: "Germinate the wonder" recurs as near-thematic echo, and the closing lines ("wonder, once routine's foe, now germinated everywhere") veer toward summary rather than letting the image carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is present (aurora as "captured sky fragment," routine as drudgery). The brief dialogue between Kael and Lira feels natural and goal-driven ("Relic for your forge?" / shrug / wing reveal). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("vibrate sympathetically," "germinate," "across the fade") that feels more authorial than courier-particular. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "routine suspicion in her gaze" and "envisioned forges lit by captured auroras" narrate Lira's interiority with unwarranted certainty for Kael's POV, a minor emotional ventriloquism slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but multiple prose artifacts cluster: paraphrase loops ("absent mentor whose voice echoed only in faded memories" / "Now, across the fade from memory to myth, Thorne's tales blurred"), thesaurus churn ("coax," "germinate," "vibrate sympathetically" recur as conceptual synonyms), and template cadence in the closing third ("Auroras danced on, eternal witnesses. / The pendant's vibration lingered... / Thorne's absence? A seed... / Kael pressed on..."). Stock metaphors ("cracking like dry leaves," "seeds in thawed soil") appear in high-pressure beats. Generation-scaffold artifacts ("germinates," "sympathetically," "across the fade") recur mechanically. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for artifact spread touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—relic courier + absent mentor as myth-seed + wonder from routine—is specific and non-obvious. The dragonfly-wing pendant's time-warping property and the ridgeway as liminal space feel fresh. However, the premise echoes familiar templates (mentor's legacy, magic object sparking transformation) without full transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional specificity (Lira's forge dreams, Kael's jittery-to-steady arc) elevates, but the closure's inevitability ("became the myth's next verse") reads more as fulfillment than earned surprise. Risk-taking in the accumulative lens and aurora-charged setting partially offset derivative scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael frames the story, makes the key choice to offer the pendant, and his realization at closure ("deliveries had woven Thorne's absence into a tapestry") reweights prior material. Present in setup (opening), development (the offer to Lira), and payoff (final reflections). The choice to offer the pendant narrows his path (he gives it away, accepts Lira's promise), though the cost is more conceptual than visible. Causal work is solid but not indispensable—another courier could perform the same role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pendant appears in setup (Kael's fingers around it), development (held out to Lira, vibrates in her hands), and payoff (its hum lingers in Kael's chest, final line references its vibration). Handles in multiple beats, reweighted as Lira takes it and Kael internalizes its lesson. The pendant's time-warping and sympathetic vibration properties drive the Lira encounter. Removing it would break the Lira scene's mechanics. Strong integration, but the closure moment ("pendant's vibration lingered in his soul") is more summary than dramatized final use, capping just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Thorne is present in setup (opening backstory), development (his lore shared with Lira, "teaching under these auroras"), and payoff ("Thorne's myth solidified," "Thorne's absence? A seed, long germinated"). Shapes Kael's motivation and the theme of myth-building. The concept reweights at closure when Kael realizes Thorne's void germinated a lineage. However, much of Thorne's presence is reflective summary rather than on-page pressure that alters Kael's choices. The concept is essential thematically but does not constrain a middle beat with visible cost; lyric reprise partially compensates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "extends brief encounters" is signaled early (implicitly through Kael's deliveries, explicitly when "time warped; their brief encounter extended"). Used in the Lira scene to enable the vision-sharing beat. Present in payoff ("Encounters extended, routines shattered"). However, the extension is described ("their meeting into hours, though stars barely shifted") rather than dramatized with cost—no missed appointment, no exhaustion, no trade-off shown. The attribute enables but does not constrain; swappable with "deepens connections" with modest edits. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears throughout: "germinates what's buried," "wonder germinated," "void had germinated a lineage," "seed, long germinated," "germinated everywhere." Present in setup (Thorne's last words, recalled), development (Kael tells Lira the wing germinates buried sparks, her ideas germinate), and payoff (closure image of germination as legacy-building). The action shapes the Lira turn and the thematic arc. However, the mechanics are abstract—germination is declared more than shown through specific causality. Major turns trace to it, but the specificity is conceptual; swapping for "awaken" or "kindle" would require only modest edits. Strong thematic presence, mid-causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"By vibrating sympathetically" is signaled mid-story ("the wing began to vibrate sympathetically," "hummed in harmony with Lira's unspoken weariness," "syncing their heartbeats to the auroral rhythm"). Present in development and referenced at payoff ("pendant's vibration lingered"). The method matters in the Lira beat, enabling vision-sharing. However, it is not set up in the opening third (pendant hums faintly but vibration mechanics are not taught until the exchange), and it does not constrain an earlier attempt. Functional but introduced just-in-time, reducing irreplaceability; another mechanism (glowing, resonating, etc.) could substitute with modest edits. Mid-band due to late signal and moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway is present in setup (opening line, "aurora-lit ridgeway"), development (the fork where Kael meets Lira, ridgewinds, spatial choreography), and payoff ("Ridgewinds whispered approvals, auroras etching their path into legend"). Aurora light charges the pendant exchange, and the ridgeway as liminal space (Thorne vanished here, myths born here) shapes Kael's choices and the closure image. Environment constrains movement (the fork) and charges the final beat. Removing the ridgeway would necessitate reworking the entire spatial logic and symbolic scaffolding. Strong integration with causal and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" is present in setup ("across the fade from memory to myth, Thorne's tales blurred"), payoff ("Across the fade, Kael felt Thorne's myth solidify," "memory of Thorne sharpened into myth"), and thematically throughout. The timeframe is more conceptual than chronological—no ticking clock, no urgency that tightens decisions. The phrase recurs to charge theme but does not constrain a middle beat or alter tactics. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, but the element is replaceable with "over time" or "through years" without structural loss. Present but ornamental to causality; mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to coax wonder from the routine" is signaled early ("his deepest motivation burned—to coax wonder from the routine"), dramatized in the Lira encounter (offering the pendant, seeing her wonder ignite), and reweighted at closure ("wonder, once routine's foe, now germinated everywhere"). The desire drives the key choice and shapes the thematic arc. Some friction: Kael's jitteriness and the cost of giving away the pendant (Lira takes it, he continues without it) are present but understated. The motivation is essential and integrated across beats, though the cost could be sharper. Strong causal presence and closure linkage.</comment>
