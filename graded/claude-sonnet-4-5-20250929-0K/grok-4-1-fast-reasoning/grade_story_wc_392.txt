<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shows concrete detail (cataloging algae, loose grate) and her arc from empirical investigator to decisive actor is earned through the lantern catalyst. However, the entangled-memory device creates a convenience: Lila's memories provide motivation rather than Elara wrestling with her own contradictory impulses in real time—the parallel to Marcus is told through flashback comparison rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final choice (hurling the phone, calling for a restraining order) lands with visible cost but arrives via supernatural shortcut. Embodiment is strong in the tunnel beats but thins during the memory overlays, where therapeutic framing ("fortified vulnerability," "armor and wound intertwined") replaces lived sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid Causal-Accumulative (the lantern unlocks memories that reweight Elara's present stance; train reverberations accelerate the merge). Closure is on-page—Elara emerges, dials the hotline, walks into the storm—but cost legibility is weak: we see the symbolic phone-smash and are told she calls for a restraining order, yet the price of leaving Marcus (homelessness? retaliation? social isolation?) remains abstract. The Orientation Test passes (investigator, tunnel, post-drought established early), and the two-shard structure (tunnel investigation + memory merge) holds, but the causality borrows heavily from coincidence: the lantern appears exactly when needed, and the train's timing unlocks the final memory surge without Elara's agency driving the discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs (phone destruction), but the closure reconfiguration lacks the undeniable on-page cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: slick algae on ladder rungs, loose grate, sodden yellow tape, graffiti overlaying century-old chisel marks. Sensory hierarchy is strong—emergency lights, water dripping, train rumble—and the setting constrains choice (Elara must steady herself against a beam during the quake). The lantern as micro-setting object charges the final image when she emerges swinging it. However, occupational verisimilitude stumbles: a transit-authority death investigator working alone in a flooded tunnel without safety backup or communication protocol reads implausible, and the underground-railroad artifact's exact placement (glinting under silt at the fatal position) strains credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara's need to break free from Marcus—is signaled early and tightens through the entangled-memory device. The phone-smash is a clear reversal with immediate cost (loss of contact, severed digital leash), and the restraining-order call forecloses a path. Yet escalation is undercut by the supernatural mechanism: the lantern and train vibrations do the pressure work rather than Elara's own decisions narrowing her options. The parallel between Lila's overseer and Marcus is told rather than tested on the page—Marcus himself never appears, so the controlling influence remains abstract. One meaningful turn occurs, but agency is diluted by the convenient timing of memory surges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—escape from entrapment, historical parallels between enslavement and intimate-partner control—emerges through the lantern and memory overlay rather than direct statement. The "Conduct us to the light" inscription and Lila's passing-the-lantern image offer non-literal resonance. However, the final paragraph edges into overt moralizing: "her own near-entrapment was a drought of will, now ended by rain and revelation" states the metaphor rather than trusting the image. The parallel structure (Lila/Elara, overseer/Marcus, whip/rage) is schematic and risks allegorical transparency. The ending's "unbreakable resolve" declares victory without lingering ambiguity or cost complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability," empirical cataloging. Diction is controlled and voice-particular in the investigation beats. However, register drifts during the memory merge—phrases like "fortified vulnerability, armor and wound intertwined" and "entangled like roots beneath the city" read as authorial commentary rather than Elara's in-crisis lexicon. The piece elides Marcus's physical presence, which could sharpen voice contrast, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("disentangled but etched forever—her guide to unbreakable resolve") flattens the urgent interiority established earlier. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully in the tunnel beats, and imagery is concrete (tarnished brass, candlelit cellar, whip cracking like thunder). Information density is high in the cataloging sequences. However, several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("entangled memories" appears three times across adjacent paragraphs; "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability" recur as labels without fresh embodiment), template cadence in the memory-surge paragraphs ("Another reverberation shook... Elara steadied... memories surging"), and stock metaphor strings ("rivers," "veins," "roots," "chains"). The final paragraph stacks summary ("disentangled but etched forever," "unbreakable resolve") rather than landing on a charged image. Combined artifact load: −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack; the closure beat is touched by summary scaffolding, so the higher deduction applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—preventable-death investigator finds Underground Railroad artifact that unlocks ancestor memories—combines familiar elements (historical-trauma link, magical object, domestic-abuse escape) in a recognizable template. The entangled-memory device is a common speculative trope, and the Lila/Elara parallel structure follows a well-worn dual-timeline pattern. Specificity in setting (post-drought NYC subway tunnels, abolitionist symbols) provides texture, but the emotional arc (realization → symbolic gesture → freedom call) does not transform the template. The lantern's convenient appearance and the train's perfectly timed reverberations lean on plot mechanics rather than fresh synthesis. Risk-taking is modest; the piece executes competently within genre expectations but does not offer a non-obvious turn or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the investigation, but her role as preventable-death investigator does not drive key turns—her decisions at closure (phone destruction, restraining order) stem from the entangled-memory revelation rather than investigative insight. The cataloging beats (algae, grate, signage) establish professional observation but do not alter tactics or stakes. She kneels, lifts the lantern, presses deeper, climbs the ladder—actions that respond to supernatural prompts rather than investigative choices with visible cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present but the occupation itself is not causally indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lantern appears early (kneeling by yellow tape, ~30% mark), recurs across multiple beats (lifted carefully, memories triggered, tucked in satchel, swinging at closure), and charges the final image ("lantern swinging, memories disentangled"). Its Underground Railroad provenance and "Conduct us to the light" inscription tie directly to Lila's escape and Elara's present choice. All three gates are satisfied. However, the lantern's discovery is coincidental (glinting under silt at the exact fatal position) rather than earned through investigative action, and its mechanism (triggering memories on contact) is stated rather than constrained by prior logic. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement elevate the score, but swappability remains: a similar historical object could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories (Lila's experiences bleeding into Elara's perception) shape the middle escalation and motivate the climactic choice. The concept is introduced early ("memories that weren't entirely her own"), recurs across several beats (candlelit cellar, overseer pursuit, lantern-passing), and explicitly drives Elara's decision to break free. All three gates are met. However, the mechanics are told rather than constrained—"The vibration unlocked more: Lila's memories bleeding into Elara's, entangled like roots"—and the concept functions as a convenience device that delivers motivation rather than forcing Elara to wrestle with conflicting impulses in real time. The specificity is moderate (Lila's exact sensory details), but the entangled-memory trope is a familiar speculative shortcut.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is introduced early ("She was watchfully calm, her pulse steady") and restated twice ("Watchfully calm, she observed the parallels empirically"; "Watchfully calm, Elara walked into the storm"). The trait is asserted as a label but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—Elara's empirical observation continues regardless of emotional pressure, and the attribute does not prevent her from making the climactic choice. No moment shows the trait forcing a tradeoff or shaping tactics under stress. Setup and closure gates are met via restatement, but development is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears in multiple beats: the train rumble, vibrations shaking loose pebbles and unlocking memories, the final quake when Elara hurls her phone. The action is signaled early, recurs with escalating intensity, and culminates at the climactic moment ("The reverberations peaked as a train roared past... In that quake, Elara hurled the phone"). All three gates are satisfied, and the action drives key turns (memory unlocking, symbolic phone destruction). However, the reverberations are externally triggered (train schedule) rather than caused by Elara's choices, and the mechanism (vibration → memory surge) is told convenience. Strong closure linkage elevates the score, but causality remains thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is introduced early (Elara "prided herself on empirical observation, sifting facts from fog") and restated ("Watchfully calm, she observed the parallels empirically"; "She pulled out her notebook, empirically logging the lantern's inscriptions"). The method frames Elara's professional stance but does not shape attempts or alter tactics—her cataloging of algae and signage does not drive the plot, and the climactic choice is motivated by supernatural memory surge rather than investigative deduction. Setup and development are label-only; the notebook beat is ornamental (logging inscriptions after the memories have already arrived). The method does not constrain or enable the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is established immediately and anchors every beat: ankle-deep puddles, algae on ladder rungs, loose grate, sodden yellow tape, graffiti over chisel marks, water dripping, train rumble, beam for steadying. The setting pressures Elara's movement (slick surfaces, confined space during train passage) and supplies the lantern discovery. Spatial choreography is coherent (kneeling, pressing deeper, climbing the ladder), and the tunnel's historical function (repurposed Underground Railroad passage) ties directly to the thematic core. All three gates are met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage (she "climbed the ladder" and "emerged into the rain-slicked night"). Minor swappability: another confined historical space could serve, but the subway-tunnel specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" is signaled in the opening line ("Rain finally broke the drought's iron grip") and recurs in Elara's reflection ("her own near-entrapment was a drought of will, now ended by rain and revelation"). The timeframe provides atmospheric context (cracked streets turning to rivers, flooded tracks) and metaphorical resonance (drought of will → rain of freedom). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—the three-day gap since the worker's death is mentioned but not tracked as a live deadline, and the investigation proceeds without time pressure. The post-drought condition enables the flooded-tunnel setting but does not constrain Elara's choices. Moderate lyric reprise elevates the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to break free from a controlling influence" is signaled early (Marcus's "jealousy chained her tighter than any iron") and drives the climactic choice (phone destruction, restraining-order call). Elara's desire is dramatized through the Lila parallel (overseer/Marcus) and tested in the final beat with visible cost (severed contact, legal escalation). All three gates are satisfied. However, the motivation is delivered via entangled-memory shortcut rather than on-page friction between Elara's wants and Marcus's present pressure—Marcus never appears, and the controlling influence remains abstract. The phone-buzz intrusion provides one concrete stake moment, but the escalation is told through memory comparison rather than lived conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is introduced early ("its presence a fortified vulnerability, armor and wound intertwined") and restated at the ending ("fortified in her vulnerability, she climbed the ladder"). The tone modulates across beats—watchful calm in the cataloging sequences, shivering intimacy during memory surges, defiant resolve at the phone-smash. Setup and closure gates are met. However, the phrase itself is an abstract authorial label rather than a tonal texture emergent from diction and rhythm—phrases like "armor and wound intertwined" and "fortified in her vulnerability" explain the tone rather than enacting it. The tone does charge the final image (lantern-swinging emergence) but the reliance on explicit labeling limits integration. Moderate lyric reprise and coherent modulation place the score in mid-band.</comment>
