<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias pursues a clear goal (redeeming his father's legacy through vengeance) and his interior motivation is legible, but the murders themselves remain abstract—we never see him choosing a victim or wrestling with the act in scene. The embodied emotion is thin: "Elias smiled faintly" and murmuring confessions lack visceral contradiction or cost in the moment. The final act (releasing his father's shade) feels more ritual than earned renunciation; no prior beat shows him genuinely torn between violence and peace, so the closure reads smooth rather than purchased.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (copperlight/hush/hovering motifs layer toward a final resonance). Orientation anchors arrive within ~120 words (lighthouse prison, Elias, father's legacy). The closure—releasing the father's shade into the void, threading the labyrinth complete—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush is achieved, the narrative etched), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: "bodies still secret" tells us discovery looms, yet no on-page moment makes us feel the forfeiture or consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (deeper into the labyrinth, shades coalesce, lattice pulses), satisfying the length default, but the accumulative payoff lacks a final image that reweights prior pressure with undeniable felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copperlight, and confessional lattice are vivid and consistent, and spatial choreography (spiral stair, narrow door, chapel alcove, labyrinth core) tracks cleanly. The lattice functions as micro-setting: it constrains his method (murmuring confessions into it to bind shades) and charges the final image when he replaces it "imperfectly." The copperlight filters through at pivotal beats, modulating tone and anchoring the reposeful atmosphere. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; more tactile or auditory detail during high-pressure turns would deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: achieve hush/redemption before bodies are discovered. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (copperlight → hovering shades → father's face → core void → release), but no beat forces a trade-off or narrows Elias's options—he moves linearly deeper without resistance. The timeframe ("before they find the bodies") hangs as abstract menace; no guard patrol or sound cue tightens the clock on the page. The cost (bodies hidden, guards oblivious) is told at the end rather than tested in scene, so the pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, silenced truth, vengeance as redemption—emerges through image (hovering shades, lattice, copperlight) rather than statement. The lattice and copperlight recur with purpose, reweighting the hush motif at closure. However, the ending leans toward moralizing cadence: "His father's legacy, once a curse, now sustained the impossible peace" summarizes theme rather than letting the final image (shades watching, door ajar) speak alone. The piece invites reflection on ignored warnings and complicity, but the protagonist's arc—rage to repose—proceeds without surprise or contradiction, limiting thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("reposeful," "thread," "hush") creates a distinct lyric texture. The prose filters perception through Elias's goal (silence, redemption), maintaining narrative modesty. However, elevated register ("bowels twisted like the tales," "wolfish howls made manifest") occasionally floats above his immediate experience, and some lines ("Hovering faintly at the periphery of vision, grateful shades watched") drift into external omniscience. No dialogue appears, so conversational subtext is not tested. Perceptual signature is present but could be more embodied—less copperlight description, more tactile engagement with the lattice and stone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries figurative language ("copperlight pooled like molten repose," "hovering form coalesced," "wolfish howls made manifest") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops cluster: "hush he pursued," "chasing hush," "hush he had cultivated," "hush achieved" recur without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence runs in parallel: "He pried… He squeezed… He pressed… He moved" (−0.4). Register drift into elevated diction ("labyrinthine bowels," "filigree") clashes with the visceral stakes (−0.3). Cumulatively −1.5 within Q7. Clarity holds, but momentum drags under ornament; the final paragraph ("In that moment, the lighthouse prison dreamed in repose") adds a metaphor after closure instead of letting the image land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Son of the boy who cried wolf" offers a fresh premise angle, and the lighthouse-prison labyrinth + confessional-lattice combination feels specific. However, execution leans on stock Gothic furniture (hovering shades, copperlight, spiral stair) without transforming them through character-specific choice or world logic. The emotional arc—rage to repose—proceeds predictably; no turn surprises in hindsight. The copperlight/hush/thread motifs recur but feel assembled rather than inevitable. The piece reads competent but derivative, landing mid-band: familiar materials arranged with care but no bold risk that heightens stakes or deepens moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias, son of the boy who cried wolf, is present and his backstory (father's dismissed warnings, perished in prison) frames his motivation. He makes decisions: to chase hush, to kill guards, to thread the labyrinth, to release his father's shade. However, the murders happen off-page ("bodies piled in the cells below" is told), and the final choice (releasing the shade) is executed without on-page friction or cost—no moment where he hesitates or sacrifices an alternative. His choices advance the plot but remain frictionless; swapping him for "son of a martyr" would require minor edits only. Present by first paragraph (Setup ✓), involved in middle descent (Development ✓), and central to the ending (Payoff ✓). Two beats: pursuit through labyrinth, release of shade (+0.9). Causal pressure moderate: his murmuring binds shades (+0.7). Closure linkage moderate: he enacts the release (+0.9). Swappability moderate: role could generalize to "avenging heir" (−0.5). Late arrivals and ornamental use do not apply. Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +0.9 beats, +0.7 pressure, +0.9 closure, −0.5 swap = 5.8 → 4.2 after dominant limiter (frictionless choice, cap ~4.6).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The confessional lattice appears early (chapel alcove, first third: Setup ✓), Elias pries it free and uses it to murmur confessions that bind hovering shades (middle: Development ✓), and he replaces it "imperfectly" at the end, leaving its power "dormant until the next chaser" (Payoff ✓). Three beats: acquisition, binding ritual, replacement (+1.4). Causal pressure: the lattice "sustained impossibilities," enabling the shade-binding (+1.0). Closure linkage: the replacement charges the final image of dormancy and invitation (+1.2). Specificity high: its "wooden filigree" and "lattice thrummed" are concrete (+0.6). Cost connection oblique: no visible price for using it (0.0). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +1.4 beats, +1.0 pressure, +1.2 closure, +0.6 specific = 8.0. Minor swappability: could a different relic serve? (−0.3). Handling is present but partly summary ("clutching it, Elias felt the air thicken") rather than fully embodied action (−0.3). Net deductions −0.6 → 7.4. Rounding down: 6.8 (applying dominant limiter for partial embodiment and slight swappability).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named in the first third (Setup ✓) and Elias pursues it through the labyrinth (Development ✓); the ending declares "hush achieved" and "hush enveloped all" (Payoff ✓). Two beats: descent seeking hush, achievement at core (+0.9). Causal pressure moderate: hush shapes his goal and the lattice ritual serves it (+0.8). Closure linkage strong: "hush achieved" and "repose held sway" frame the final image (+1.3). Specificity low: "hush" remains abstract; how does he measure or experience it beyond "air grew still"? (−0.6). Swappability moderate: "seeking peace" or "pursuing silence" would function similarly (−0.5). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +0.9 beats, +0.8 pressure, +1.3 closure, −0.6 abstract, −0.5 swap = 5.7. Lyric-resonance allowance: the hush seed → final reprise reweights the stake (+0.2) → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is named twice: the lattice "sustained impossibilities—whispers of sins long faded yet eternally audible" and "Inside, the air grew still, a deeper hush that sustained the impossible: shadows detached from walls and began to hover." Present by middle (Setup ✗ if judged strictly by first third, ✓ if middle qualifies), clearly active in middle beats (Development ✓), and implicit at closure when shades collapse into silence (Payoff ✓). One beat: enabling hovering shades (+0.4). Causal pressure: the attribute enables the central device (shade-binding) (+1.0). Closure linkage: shades "merge" and "hovering ceased," inverting the attribute (+1.0). Specificity: trait is label-only; mechanism unclear (−0.7). Swappability high: "allows magic" or "holds echoes" would serve (−0.6). Cost: no visible tradeoff for using it (0.0). Starting at 3.0: +0.4 beats, +1.0 pressure, +1.0 closure, −0.7 label, −0.6 swap = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hover" recurs throughout: shadows hover, father's face hovers, shades hover in escort, "hovering ceased" at closure. Present early (Setup ✓), integral to middle binding ritual (Development ✓), and resolved at the core when "the hovering ceased, collapsing into silence" (Payoff ✓). Three beats: shadows detach and hover, father's shade hovers closer, cessation at closure (+1.4). Causal pressure: hovering is the form Elias must bind and then release (+1.2). Closure linkage: "hovering ceased" is the decisive image of completion (+1.5). Specificity moderate: hovering is concrete but mechanism is vague (+0.4). Swappability: could "drift" or "float" replace it? Mostly, but "hover" carries stasis that "drift" lacks (−0.3). Cost: no price shown for the hovering or its cessation (0.0). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +1.4 beats, +1.2 pressure, +1.5 closure, +0.4 specific, −0.3 swap = 8.0. Label-only use in some beats (−0.3): "hovering form" and "hovering apparitions" are noun phrases without action pressure in those lines. Net 7.7 → 5.3 after dominant limiter (action is named but not dramatized with felt resistance or cost, capping ~5.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" appears in the middle: "A narrow door nearby, left ajar for decades, beckoned with scuffs from countless illicit passages… Through those scuffs on the narrow door, Elias glimpsed the method to the labyrinth's heart." Setup ✗ (arrives ~40% in, −0.3), Development ✓ (he squeezes through, guided by scuffs), Payoff ✓ (he exits "through the ajar door" and "Through the scuffs, the door remained ajar"). Two beats: entry and exit (+0.9). Causal pressure: the scuffs guide him through the maze (+0.9). Closure linkage: door "remained ajar, inviting the next son" reprises the method (+1.0). Specificity: "scuffs" are concrete but mechanism (how they guide) is asserted not shown (+0.3). Swappability: "following marks" or "through the gap" would function (−0.5). Starting at 3.0: +0.9 beats, +0.9 pressure, +1.0 closure, +0.3 specific, −0.3 late, −0.5 swap = 5.3. Summary-only use: "glimpsed the method" tells rather than dramatizes discovery (−0.4) → 4.9. Rounding 4.7 after dominant limiter (late + summary, cap ~4.6 lifted slightly by closure reprise).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison off a jagged reef is named in the opening line and anchors every scene (Setup ✓). The reef and prison frame the stakes (father perished here, bodies hidden), and the labyrinthine interior shapes Elias's path (Development ✓). The ending returns to the prison's sentinel presence and the reef's waves (Payoff ✓). Three beats: establishing shot, descent through prison bowels, return to chapel and window (+1.4). Causal pressure: the prison's maze structure is essential to the threading ritual (+1.3). Closure linkage: "The lighthouse prison stood sentinel, sustaining its own impossibilities under the endless copperlight" frames the final image (+1.2). Specificity: "jagged reef," "salt-etched windows," "labyrinthine bowels" are vivid (+0.7). Swappability: prison + reef combination is distinctive but could another isolated fortress serve? Mostly yes (−0.4). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +1.4 beats, +1.3 pressure, +1.2 closure, +0.7 specific, −0.4 swap = 8.0. Ornamental use: much description (copperlight, reef) is atmospheric without constraining choice (−0.6). Net 7.4 → 6.2 after ornamental penalty and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is stated explicitly: "before the guards found the bodies piled in the cells below" (first third, Setup ✓) and "For now, before they found the bodies, repose held sway" (ending, Payoff ✓). Development ✗: no middle beat shows Elias checking the clock, hearing patrol footsteps, or adjusting tactics due to time pressure. One beat: ending acknowledgment (+0.4). Causal pressure minimal: the timeframe motivates the goal but does not narrow options on the page (+0.3). Closure linkage: "before the inevitable discovery" charges the final image with precarity (+0.9). Specificity low: no concrete measure of elapsed time or proximity of discovery (−0.5). Swappability high: "before dawn" or "before they return" would function identically (−0.6). Starting at 3.0: +0.4 beats, +0.3 pressure, +0.9 closure, −0.5 vague, −0.6 swap = 3.5. Lyric-resonance allowance: early seed → final reprise reweights with menace (+0.3) → 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is named early ("to weave his truth through these corridors," "thread it with a story of one's own to survive") and repeated: "threading the labyrinth with his story," "thread this labyrinth with our story," "his narrative etched indelibly," "the labyrinth threaded with redemption's hush." Setup ✓, Development ✓ (murmuring confessions into the lattice to bind shades), Payoff ✓ ("In that copperlight repose, the hovering ceased, collapsing into silence as his story threaded complete"). Two beats: descent narrating, completion at core (+0.9). Causal pressure: the threading (confession ritual) is his method for achieving hush (+1.1). Closure linkage: "story threaded complete" is the closure verb (+1.4). Specificity moderate: "thread" is vivid but mechanism (how words bind shades) is vague (+0.4). Swappability: "tell your story" or "claim the labyrinth" would serve (−0.5). Cost: no visible sacrifice or friction in the threading (0.0). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +0.9 beats, +1.1 pressure, +1.4 closure, +0.4 specific, −0.5 swap = 7.1. Label-only use in some beats: "threading" is asserted more than dramatized with resistance (−0.4). Told-only in places: "his voice weaving" summarizes rather than quoting or showing (−0.4). Net deductions −0.8 → 6.3. Rounding 5.6 after dominant limiter (mechanism vague, cost absent, cap ~5.8).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" is named in the opening ("The copperlight of perpetual dusk filtered… casting a reposeful sheen") and recurs throughout: "copperlight pooled like molten repose," "In the chapel, where copperlight pooled," "copperlight following like a faithful specter," "copperlight bathing his face in calm," "In that copperlight repose, the hovering ceased," "In that moment, the lighthouse prison dreamed in repose." Setup ✓, Development ✓ (modulates through descent and binding), Payoff ✓ (final image). Three or more beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: tone does not constrain choice but charges atmosphere consistently (+0.6). Closure linkage: "copperlight repose" frames the ending image strongly (+1.5). Specificity: "copperlight" is concrete and distinctive (+0.7). Swappability: "amber twilight" or "golden stillness" could replace (−0.5). Starting at 3.0: +0.8 early, +1.4 beats, +0.6 pressure, +1.5 closure, +0.7 specific, −0.5 swap = 7.5. Ornamental overuse: copperlight appears in nearly every beat without always serving pressure (−0.4). Static mood: repose is consistent but does not modulate tension (−0.3). Net deductions −0.7 → 6.8. Rounding 6.4 after ornamental and static penalties.</comment>
