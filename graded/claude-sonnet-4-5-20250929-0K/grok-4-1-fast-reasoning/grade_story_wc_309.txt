<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation ("to find the sacred in the simple") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The unstrapping sequence shows deliberate micro-choices, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("mediocrity," "underachieving") and stock epiphany language ("sacred," "simple") rather than particular embodied perception. The final decision to grasp the keystone lacks visible internal conflict or foreclosed alternatives; power simply "surges" without a felt tradeoff on the page. Emotional progression reads as steady escalation toward triumph without the friction of competing desires or genuine risk of failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early (automated era, icebound spire, Thorne). A single tightening occurs: Thorne unstraps bindings, enabling mist walking to reach the keystone. However, the closure lacks visible cost—grasping the keystone delivers power and promise without foreclosing a path or imposing a felt price. The piece reads under a Causal lens (because Thorne unstraps, he can mist walk; because he reaches the keystone, he gains power), yet the final beat offers uplift and potential ("promised rebellion") rather than a decisive change with on-page consequence. The inferred lens holds, but the Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes cost legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly evoked with selective sensory detail (frost-etched stairs, winds howling, ozone-tinged air), and the setting's impossibilities (defying gravity, perpetual twilight) are established early. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the final image in a way that alters outcome—Thorne's path up the spire is linear, and the keystone's location in a mist vortex introduces the mist-walking requirement but does not force a tradeoff. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than an active agent in the closure. Orientation Test penalty waived; the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met, capping this category at 8.8, though execution does not reach that threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming true magic and the "sacred simple"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thorne unstraps the bindings, enabling access to the keystone. Yet the escalation lacks a visible price: no live option is foreclosed, no tradeoff dramatized. Thorne moves from "underachieving" to empowered without on-page loss or renunciation; the spire trembles "in approval," and power "surges" as a reward rather than a contested gain. The Cost proof test fails; the closure beat offers promise ("rebellion," "dawn") but no felt sacrifice or consequence that would elevate the tightening into genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—human creativity versus automation, the sacred in simplicity—is declared overtly in Thorne's motivation and the narrator's framing ("algorithms that painted grandeur but erased the handmade hush"). The keystone recurs and accumulates meaning, yet its symbolic charge is stated rather than enacted through a non-literal final image. The ending articulates the theme directly ("humanity's creativity, unstrapped and mist-walking toward dawn") rather than allowing it to emerge from particulars. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6): the final paragraphs summarize the thesis in prompt-like language, replacing scene pressure with assertion. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a binary (authentic vs. automated) without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("vast Artificers wove symphonies," "brilliance dimmed," "automated elegies"), creating a lyric texture. However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction and thesaurus-driven phrasing ("accommodates impossibilities," "lingering luminance") that can feel external to Thorne's lived perspective. Filter verbs ("he had read," "he knew") are present but not intrusive. Perceptual signature is generic—descriptive details read as narrator-provided rather than filtered through Thorne's particular priorities or biases. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity and compression under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("winds howled like automated elegies," "clouds parted like silk," "chorus of ice cracking into prisms") applies metaphor in most sentences without a taught pattern, triggering the Overwriting penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "simple" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure ("sacred in the simple," "simple stone," "simple: footfalls," "eternally simple"). Template cadence runs of "He [verb]" and "Thorne [verb]" span multiple sentences. Stock metaphor strings ("brilliance dimmed," "lingering luminance," "brilliant dimness") blur specificity. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("eternally simple"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Combined artifact penalty in Q7: −1.4 (paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor/register drift −0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—underdog mage in an automated creative age—echoes familiar tropes (magic vs. technology, artisan vs. machine), and the emotional arc (failure to triumph) follows a well-worn template. The garden folly keystone offers a specific detail, yet its function (ancient relic anchoring impossibilities) is not transformed through lived consequence or non-obvious calculus. The ending's uplift ("promised rebellion," "mist-walking toward dawn") offers potential rather than a realized synthesis. Transformation test: the plot and arc could transfer to different names/settings with minimal change. No close proximity to famous lines, but the voice and stakes do not achieve a singular artistic stance—execution reads competent but predictable within genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thorne is present throughout, framing the journey and making the choice to unstrap and grasp the keystone. However, his decisions do not create key turns—unstrapping is the logical next step once he reaches the keystone, and the story does not dramatize internal conflict or a competing option that would make the choice feel causal or costly. He is active but his agency trends toward observation and steady progress rather than choices that redefine stakes. Setup and development gates met; closure participation present but passive (he grasps, power surges). Swappability moderate; cost connection weak (no visible price tied to his "underachieving" trait at closure). Band: functional across beats but replaceable in impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The keystone is seeded early (pinnacle paragraph), returns with accumulated meaning (anchors impossibilities, pulses with luminance), and is grasped at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Beat involvement: two distinct beats (discovery, grasping). Closure linkage strong (final act hinges on grasping it). However, causal pressure is modest—the keystone grants power without imposing a dramatized tradeoff or altering Thorne's tactics beyond the mist-walking requirement. Specificity moderate (vine-scrolls, estate origin); irreplaceability arguable (any ancient artifact could anchor the spire). Cost connection weak (no visible price for claiming it). Band: essential across beats, but lacks the felt cost and tactical constraint for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" appears as descriptive motif (keystone's glow, trails in mist, lantern metaphor) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept echoes thematically (persistent vs. automated light) but remains ornamental—Thorne's choices are not altered by the luminance itself. Setup gate met (keystone paragraph); development weak (luminance described, not used); closure participation present (keystone's light as lantern) but passive. No causal pressure or cost tied to the concept. Swappability high; any persistent quality could substitute. Band: present and thematically consistent, but does not constrain action or reweight options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The spire "accommodates impossibilities" (defies gravity, time, automation)—a label established early and repeated. The keystone "accommodated them all," enabling the spire's float and mist's weight-bearing. However, the attribute does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Thorne does not navigate a tradeoff imposed by the impossibilities; they function as setting flavor. Setup gate met; development weak (mentioned, not tested); closure participation minimal (keystone connection asserted, not dramatized). No visible cost or tactical friction. Band: functional backdrop, label-only without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unstrapping the bindings is the pivotal action that frees Thorne's magic and enables mist walking. Setup gate met (bindings introduced mid-story); development strong (unstrapping sequence spans multiple beats with deliberate steps); payoff clear (freed hands glow, mist walking becomes possible). Beat involvement: two distinct beats (unstrap wrists, unstrap ankles; then step into mist). Causal pressure moderate—the action narrows options (no turning back) and enables the closure, though the cost is not made visible (what price for removing safety?). Specificity solid; irreplaceability high (no other action would unlock the same pathway). Cost connection weak on the page. Band: essential to structure, but lacks felt consequence at the moment of execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mist walking is introduced late (after the halfway mark) as the method to reach the keystone. Its mechanics are briefly explained ("stepping on vapor as if solid," "forgotten since automation deemed it inefficient") and executed in one beat. Setup gate weak (late signal); development minimal (one attempt); payoff present (enables keystone access). No causal pressure prior to its use; it solves a problem (untouchable keystone in mist vortex) that it did not help create. Swappability moderate (any forgotten skill could substitute). Cost connection absent (no price for employing it). Late-arrival cap applies (4.6). Band: functional but introduced on demand, trends low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire is present throughout, shaping the journey's difficulty (frost-etched stairs, perpetual twilight, winds). Setup gate met (opening paragraphs); development strong (physical challenge across multiple beats); payoff solid (pinnacle location frames the keystone's discovery). Beat involvement: three or more (ascent, pinnacle arrival, mist vortex navigation). However, the setting does not impose a tactical choice or constraint that alters Thorne's approach—he climbs, reaches the top, and proceeds. Spatial choreography clear; sensory detail vivid. Closure linkage present but not charged (the spire "sang" in response, but this is assertion, not causal pressure). Band: essential backdrop across beats, but does not force a tradeoff or reweight the final image in a way that would elevate the score further.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "when creativity gets automated" is established in the opening line and provides thematic backdrop. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—Thorne's choices are not clock-driven or altered by temporal pressure within the automated era. The element functions as setting flavor and motivation (escaping mediocrity in an automated age) but remains static. Setup gate met; development weak (mentioned, not tested); closure participation minimal (the automated world "awaited" below, but no on-page consequence tied to time). No causal pressure or cost. Band: present as context, ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sacred in the simple" is declared early ("driven by a singular motivation") and echoed at closure ("he had found it"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Thorne's actions align with the stated goal without visible friction between wants and costs—there is no moment where simplicity competes with ambition, or where the sacred demands sacrifice. Setup gate met; development weak (asserted, not tested); closure participation present (final realization) but summary-only. No on-page trade-off or visible price. Band: functional label that frames the arc, but lacks embodied conflict or felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" (oxymoronic glow) recurs as tone and image (cloud seas, lingering luminance, dimmed brilliance). The phrase is established early and returns at closure ("dimmed brilliance ready to reignite"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (twilight → pinnacle winds → final glow). However, the tone does not charge the final image with pressure or cost—it remains a consistent atmospheric quality rather than a dynamic force that reweights the ending. Specificity solid; irreplaceability moderate. Closure linkage present but passive. Band: purposeful and integrated, but does not intensify or complicate the closure effect.</comment>
