<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior is dominated by abstract philosophical musing ("mathematics of emotion," "joy equaled sorrow's derivative") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The personality-borrowing trait is asserted repeatedly but never generates a visible internal conflict or cost-driven choice—he borrows Mira's fear, staggers, then the loop resolves without foreclosing options. Mira's terror is labeled and transferred but not dramatically tested; her shift to equation-scribbling feels like a plot convenience rather than an earned transformation. The closure renunciation ("reset the press, ready to print") reads as routine rather than a path foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (topaz workshop, Elias, star-vanishing timeframe) arrive early and remain stable. The causal chain is present but weakened by coincidence: Mira arrives exactly when Elias activates the fragment, and the transpose peaks without clear protagonist agency driving the escalation. The closure image—"new star flickered faintly," "Elias reset the press"—gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost is vague; no concrete option or relationship is visibly foreclosed, and the ending returns to status quo ("His habit unbroken") rather than reweighting prior stakes. The lens reads Causal-hybrid but wobbles at closure when the fragment's power is "spent" off-page and resolution hinges on passive observation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, star-vanishing sky, and letterpress are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail ("hummed like a trapped hornet," "turbulent refractions"). The halo fragment constrains the transpose action and charges the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography during the transpose feedback loop is unclear—where Elias and Mira stand, how they handle the fragment and press simultaneously—and the workshop's physical layout does not evolve or resist tactics. The final star's flicker is a strong atmospheric reprise but does not demonstrably alter the protagonist's choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—quantifying emotion via the transpose—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the transpose ignites and Elias absorbs Mira's dread, but this reversal is triggered by the fragment's autonomous amplification rather than protagonist decision, undercutting agency. The resolution ("emotion was not mere sum but infinite series") is told in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. Cost is asserted ("fragment dimmed, its power spent") but happens off-page; no visible trade-off or loss alters Elias's tactics or final stance. The feedback loop is atmospheric but does not escalate through protagonist action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of quantifying emotion emerges concretely through the letterpress, halo fragment, and transpose mechanics. The final realization—"transposed empathy was the ultimate equation"—is earned by the on-page transpose experience rather than abstract philosophizing. However, the closure image's non-literal resonance is weakened by the direct thematic statement "Disorientation had forged clarity" and the summary "emotion's rebirth," which explain rather than embody the answer. The topaz and star motifs recur purposefully but do not carry contradictory meaning that charges the ending; they remain illustrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Elias's perceptual filter is consistent throughout. However, the prose distance oscillates between close embodiment ("his thoughts churned clear yet chaotic") and detached summary ("he understood: transposed empathy was the ultimate equation"), flattening peak moments. Mira's brief dialogue and the shared chorus ("The halo fractures to unify") converge in register without distinct idiom, though the effect may be intentional during the transpose. The narrative voice leans on elevated diction ("lucid turbulence," "arcuate path") that occasionally drifts from Elias's operator role without clear motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences ("Disoriented, he printed furiously" / "Mira, now fully his mirror, assisted"), template cadence with repetitive stems ("He handed her," "He had designed," "He grabbed"), and stock metaphor strings ("ink on wet paper," "molten topaz"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt the pull," "saw the stars' vanishing," "understood"). The final third contains decorative sentence fragments ("Topaz gleamed eternally. Between vanishings, truth endured.") that add texture without advancing causality. These issues materially dull the closure image and trigger the artifact penalty pack with global 9+ disallowance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, celestial mechanics, and emotional mathematics offers a fresh premise. The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and personality-borrowing are specific and non-generic. However, the core emotional arc—stranger arrives seeking help, protagonist uses mystical tool, mutual transformation occurs—follows a familiar template without a bold inflection. The transpose concept is intriguing but resolved through summary ("infinite series") rather than a non-obvious choice that grows from prior particulars. The ending resets to status quo ("ready to print the revelation for whoever next wandered in"), which undercuts conceptual risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decision to activate the press with the halo fragment triggers the transpose. However, his choices after the inciting beat are reactive—he "staggers," "reels," "grabs the fragment"—rather than driving turns. The closure decision to "reset the press" is mentioned but not dramatized as a choice with visible alternatives or cost. The cryptic operator trait shapes tone but does not constrain a pivotal on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment is embedded in the press at the start, actively pulses during the transpose climax, and dims at resolution—three distinct beats. Its properties (transposed empathy, iridescent veins, heat) enable the core action and constrain the outcome (power spent). The fragment's presence in the closure beat ("its power spent in the exchange") directly shapes the ending. Removing it would break the transpose mechanism and the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is defined early, enacted on-page when Elias absorbs Mira's fear and she gains his quest, and restated at closure ("transposed empathy was the ultimate equation"). The concept shapes the middle turn and alters both characters' emotional states. However, the transpose does not force a tactical choice with visible alternatives; it happens to them via the fragment's amplification, reducing its role from driver to mechanism. The cost (fragment spent) is tied to the concept but feels passive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The personality-borrowing trait is asserted in the setup ("Habitually, he borrowed personalities") and demonstrated when Elias adopts Mira's dread and voice modulation. However, this borrowing does not constrain or enable a key choice—it occurs, causes disorientation, then resolves without altering tactics or foreclosing an option. The trait is more atmospheric flavor than a load-bearing attribute with visible tradeoff. It appears in two beats but remains largely label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as the intended effect of the ambiguous broadsheet and as Elias's own state during the transpose feedback loop. The action is present in the middle beat (Mira reads, transpose ignites) and referenced at closure ("Disorientation had forged clarity"). However, the disorientation is not the protagonist's chosen tactic—it recoils upon him unexpectedly—and the resolution does not hinge on a disorienting move. The action could be replaced with "transform" or "transpose" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Deliberate ambiguity" is invoked when Elias composes the broadsheet lines ("Light bends where shadow yearns") and again when he prints "furiously, each ambiguous phrase a scalpel." The method appears in two beats and is tied to the disorient action. However, the mechanics are not dramatized—we do not see how ambiguous phrasing activates the transpose—and the method does not shape a choice or constrain the outcome. It reads as thematic coloring rather than a tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored early, its walls amplify starlight and cast refractions, and the press is handled across multiple beats. The setting supplies the letterpress tool that enables the transpose and the fragment's embedding. Spatial details (stool, gravel path, topaz walls warping) recur and the setting participates in the closure image ("topaz workshop steadying under the starless sky"). Removing the topaz specificity would weaken atmosphere but not break logic; the workshop's physical properties do not constrain a tactic in a way that generic "workshop" could not.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vanishing-star timeframe is established in the opening and recurs as a rhythmic marker ("Between the vanishing of Lyra's Jewel," "Between the next two vanishing stars," "penultimate star winked out"). However, the time constraint does not tighten decisions—Elias and Mira act without visible time pressure, and the transpose resolves before the final star vanishes. The clock is ornamental rather than a forcing mechanism that alters tactics or accelerates choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated early and motivates his use of the press and fragment. The transpose experience provides on-page data toward that goal, and the closure delivers a realization ("emotion was not mere sum but infinite series"). However, the motivation is not dramatized as a conflicted choice—no visible cost or competing want tests his commitment. The desire drives setup and colors reflection but does not force a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is invoked twice by name and reflected in the prose's oscillation between precise technical language and chaotic imagery during the transpose. The tone modulates with pressure—calm setup, feverish middle, steadying close—and charges the final image ("lucid turbulence" as synthesis). However, the tone occasionally slips into ornamental lyricism ("Topaz gleamed eternally") that flattens urgency rather than intensifying it. The coherence is present but not sustained under peak stress.</comment>
