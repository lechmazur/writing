<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "spirited" and "perpetually learning" repeatedly but these traits never force a difficult choice with visible cost. Her interior life consists of abstract reverie rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The magic lantern provides convenient projections (Mira and Kai) who whisper solutions rather than forcing Elara to discover through struggle. The climactic sculpture-building feels like competent execution without genuine obstacles or mistakes that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered meanings, timewoven alliances, driftwood motifs). The opening orients who/where/when by ~120 words, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, closure lacks legible cost: Elara escapes via a lantern-sculpture that solves the GPS failure without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The "timewoven alliances" provide convenient assistance rather than forcing a renunciation or endurance with felt price. The final image ("plotting her next alliance-weave") asserts future intent but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway grounds the scene spatially and the cliff environment supplies the driftwood Elara works with. Sensory detail is vivid ("salt spray," "foam-laced debris," "winds turbine-humming") and filtered through Elara's sculptor lens. However, the archway does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image beyond serving as backdrop. The lantern slide's "fractal veins" and the sculpture's mechanics remain vague, reducing specificity when it would matter most.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping isolation after GPS failure—is signaled early. The magic lantern discovery provides a reversal, but no meaningful escalation follows: Mira and Kai offer techniques and blueprints without demanding a trade-off or testing Elara's commitment. The resolution (a lantern-sculpture compass) solves the problem the slide introduced, not one Elara helped create. Luck (finding the slide) provides the solution rather than protagonist agency narrowing options or forcing a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of "scaffolding complexity with simplicity" and "timewoven alliances" is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph summarizes the lesson ("scaffold boldly, reimagine fiercely") in prompt-like language, earning a −0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Mira's and Kai's dialogue lines ("We carve not against the sea, but with it") feel like thesis statements rather than earned wisdom from specific experience. The ending offers no non-literal answer; instead it restates the concept directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose suffers from recycled sentence stems and looped phrasing: "perpetually learning" appears six times, "turbine-hum reverie" four times, "spirited" thrice, creating template cadence. Elara's interior voice is consistent but not character-particular, reading more like elevated narration than a sculptor's mind under pressure. Mira and Kai's brief dialogue ("We carve not against the sea...") sounds interchangeable with the narrator's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pervasive text artifacts: "perpetually learning" loops across six paragraphs, "turbine-hum reverie" recurs four times, and "reimagine" appears nine times without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence runs proliferate ("Layer upon layer, she carved... Emboldened, Elara placed... Together in this reverie, they scaffolded..."). Paraphrase loops are evident: "using the slide's glow as her scaffold" / "scaffolded escape with simplicity" / "simplicity's scaffold had bound her." Stock metaphors ("temporal complexity," "essence," "infinities untold") replace concrete action. Baseline −1.2 in Q7 for loops and cadence runs; additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—sculptor finds magic artifact that projects helpful ancestors during crisis—follows a familiar template without transformation. "Timewoven alliances" and "layered meanings" remain abstract concepts rather than lived particulars. The emotional arc (isolation → magical aid → escape → renewed confidence) could transfer unchanged to different names and settings. Mira and Kai provide convenient solutions rather than complicating stakes, and the final image (vowing to "honor the archway's lesson") echoes self-help phrasing without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her key action—carving the sculpture—is not a difficult choice with cost. She observes projections and executes competently without mistakes or trade-offs. The role is swappable with any competent artisan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is found early, used to project Mira/Kai, then placed at the sculpture's heart. It appears in three beats and enables the solution. However, it introduces the problem it solves (no GPS → find slide → slide provides map), capping at 3.0 per the late-element-resolves rule. Adjusting for three-beat involvement and closure presence: 3.0 base +0.9 (two beats) +0.4 (closure linkage) +0.9 (causal involvement) = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is stated repeatedly as a concept but never constrains a choice on the page. Mira and Kai appear as projections offering advice, not as a causal pressure requiring Elara to weigh competing loyalties or costs. The concept is ornamental theme rather than stakes-shaping mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" appears six times as a label but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. It describes Elara's stance rather than forcing a difficult trade-off or mistake. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears nine times and drives Elara's sculpture-building across multiple beats. However, the action is easily swappable with "carve," "craft," or "create" without structural change. It is functional but not indispensable, lacking unique properties that redefine options. Setup early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, swappability −0.8, template phrasing −0.3 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is mentioned in narration but its mechanics remain abstract. Elara carves curves and knots that encode rituals, yet how this differs from ordinary carving is never shown. The method appears in setup and closure beats but does not shape attempts or force tactical shifts. Setup +0.5, closure mention +0.5, ornamental use −1.0, late clarity −0.4 = ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway grounds the scene spatially, supplies the debris Elara kicks through to find the slide, and its inner curve serves as a projection surface. It appears in setup, middle (projection surface), and ending (standing sentinel). Three beats +1.4, setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure (provides resources) +0.8, but lacks irreplaceability (any shelter would serve) −0.4 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The GPS failure frames the inciting incident and the story ends when "civilization's glow beckoned," confirming the timeframe. However, no live clock tightens tactics; Elara works at leisure. The timeframe is setup context rather than a pressure constraint. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.4, swappability −0.6, no middle pressure −0.2 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is stated overtly ("her motivation ignited") but not dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara pursues this goal without friction between wants and costs; the lantern slide provides convenient means. The motivation is told rather than embodied in trade-offs. Setup +0.5, told-only −0.8, no friction −0.5, closure echo +0.3, summary-only −0.3 = ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" recurs four times, anchoring the tone as meditative and mechanically rhythmic. The tone is coherent through turns and modulates slightly (storm fury → peaceful whirl at the end), charging the final image. However, recycled phrasing reduces impact. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, modulation +0.6, recycled phrasing −0.6, swappability (another mood phrase would serve) −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>
