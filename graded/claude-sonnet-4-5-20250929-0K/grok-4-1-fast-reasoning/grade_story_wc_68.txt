<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is defined by label ("rationally rebellious," "wannabe philosopher") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. His agonizing is asserted repeatedly ("began to agonize," "agonized there," "agony twisted anew") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal competing drives. The final "resolution" (fusing the cog, deciding to "surface not to convert but confront") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; he simply executes his plan. Internal voice relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("Rebellion rationalizes truth") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation debt (who Elias is, his specific location within the sewer, when "one dawn" occurs relative to "weeks prior") that persists past 120 words without teaching a pattern; the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies here and triggers the Q3=7.0 cap. Drive lens appears Causal but the actual linkage is weak: discovery of the cog does not narrow Elias's options (he was already preserving methods), the three-layer excavation sequence adds density without closing off paths, and the ending ("preservation begun; narratives competed, but his endured") asserts closure rather than demonstrating a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elias loses, risks, or forecloses by fusing the cog and broadcasting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sunken city, sewer conduit, and sedimentary layers supply vivid, purpose-driven detail (bioluminescent fungi, slime-slick walls, three strata of excavation). The cog's brass tooth and the chronometer frame function as micro-setting that constrains the excavation sequence and charges the final image. Spatial choreography within the sewer is coherent. Orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test, preventing higher scoring despite strong atmosphere and the 9+ quick test being nearly satisfied (the cog and layers do constrain his choices and appear in the closure).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve ancient methods against competing narratives) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off. The three-layer excavation adds texture without escalation: each stratum yields evidence that Elias already believed in, and no discovery forces him to abandon a tactic or pay a price. The surface envoys appear in backstory summary ("weeks prior") rather than on-page pressure. The ending claims "his narrative sharpened" and "preservation begun" without showing what option he foreclosed or what he risked by broadcasting; agency reads as execution of a pre-set plan rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of competing narratives and truth-preservation is stated overtly ("Narratives compete; evidence crowns," "Rebellion rationalizes truth") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The cog and sedimentary layers supply some thematic texture, but the ending delivers a thesis statement ("Preservation begun; narratives competed, but his endured") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. The "abrasive calm" tone and the chronometer function as motifs without constraining choice or accumulating pressure that charges the final moment. No meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading; Elias's rightness is asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("jagged spires and choked boulevards," "sedimentary scars," "scraped like gravel in a sieve") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular; Elias's interiority uses the same diction as the external narration. Filter verbs and summary interiority appear frequently ("He was rationally rebellious," "His motivation burned simple," "began to agonize") without dramatized perception. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices in tour-guide catalogs (plague ash, astrolabes, logbooks) rather than a selective, biased lens shaped by his philosopher identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "competing narratives" appears five times with minor variation; "agonize/agonizing/agonized" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs restating the same internal conflict; "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm" are repeated as labels without fresh context. Template cadence dominates the excavation sequence ("First stratum... Second layer... Third layer, deepest") and several beats open with identical structures ("Elias, a wannabe philosopher"; "Elias countered rationally"; "Elias agonized"). Stock metaphors ("drowned fire," "false heartbeats," "forgotten grudges") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. The −1.4 artifact penalty applies for spread and presence in the closure paragraph ("Preservation begun; narratives competed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise (philosopher in post-apocalypse defending rationalism against myth-making) is familiar and executed without fresh synthesis: the sunken city and chronometer are vivid set-dressing but the conflict (science vs. superstition) follows a well-worn template. The three-layer excavation and the "competing narratives" frame could offer transformation, but the ending resolves predictably (Elias vindicates his method, broadcasts his truth) without tension or cost. The "abrasive calm" tone and manifesto-scratching details add texture but do not yield an inevitable, non-obvious turn. Swappability test: replace chronometer with astrolabe or archive and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices (unearthing the cog, excavating three layers, fusing the cog to the frame, broadcasting) drive the sequence. However, most beats are observation and internal debate rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure: he was already committed to preserving methods before finding the cog, and the excavation yields only confirmatory evidence. The final "resolution" (surface to confront) is stated rather than enacted with visible cost. Setup and Development gates are met; Payoff is weak (he "smiled thinly" and claims "preservation begun" without on-page consequence). Two beats + early signal + weak closure → ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seafarer's chronometer cog appears early ("one dawn"), is handled and examined ("ticked faintly in his palm," "cog's grooves mirroring fractures"), drives the excavation sequence (seeking its twin), and is fused to the frame in the climax. Setup, Development, and Payoff gates are all met. The cog participates in three distinct beats (discovery, excavation motivation, fusion) and appears in the ending image ("cog pulsing like a second pulse"). Causal pressure is present but moderate: the cog prompts doubt but does not force a trade-off. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus late-beat passivity −0.3 → ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Competing narratives" is named five times and frames the central conflict (surface cult vs. Elias's rational preservation). Setup gate is met; Development shows Elias countering the cult's claim and using the excavation to gather evidence. Payoff is present in the ending ("narratives competed, but his endured"). However, the concept operates primarily as theme and internal debate rather than shaping on-page tactics with cost: Elias does not change his approach based on narrative friction, and the resolution is asserted rather than tested. Early signal +0.5, two beats (debate, ending claim) +0.9, closure mention +0.5, swappability (could be "dogma vs. reason") −0.5 → ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is a label applied three times without constraining or enabling a specific action with cost. Elias's choices (preserve, excavate, broadcast) would read identically if he were "quietly determined" or "stubbornly empirical." The trait does not create visible friction or trade-offs; it is asserted as characterization without dramatized consequence. Setup gate is met (label applied early); Development and Payoff are absent (no on-page moment where the trait alters tactics). Label-only use −0.8, swappability −0.6 → cap at 3.8, round to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Agonize" and its variants appear four times, framing Elias's internal conflict at the discovery, first stratum, second layer, and "one final beat." Setup and Development gates are met; the action recurs across beats and drives the excavation sequence. However, the agonizing does not produce a major turn or trade-off: each instance restates doubt without altering Elias's tactics, and the final "agonize one final beat: integrate or isolate?" is resolved immediately in the next line with no visible cost. The action is more iterative texture than decisive pivot. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, summary-only resolution −0.6, swappability (could be "deliberate," "weigh") −0.5 → ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is signaled early ("delve deeper, through sedimentary layers") and enacted in the three-stratum excavation sequence. The method's mechanics (auger, sifting, chronological descent) shape the middle beats and supply evidence that charges the ending. Setup, Development, and Payoff gates are all met. The method constrains the sequence (must go layer by layer) and its results (finding the twin cog and logbooks) drive the fusion climax. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats (excavation setup, three-layer sequence) +0.9, closure linkage (results shape ending) +0.8, specificity +0.5, ornamental layer descriptions −0.4 → ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins supply vivid detail (sewer conduit, muck, dripping arches, sedimentary strata) and constrain Elias's choices: he is physically underground, uses plumbing scraps for his auger, and must excavate through layers. Setup and Development gates are met; the setting pressures the excavation sequence. Payoff is present (ruins "exhaling secrets," "surface winds carried his first broadcast"). The setting enables and limits tactics (scavenged tools, physical descent) and appears in the final image. Early signal +0.6, two beats (excavation, broadcast) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, postcard descriptions (spires, boulevards) dilute specificity −0.4 → ~6.7, but Orientation Test cap at 7.0 applies.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" anchors the story's premise and backstory but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The plague is past-tense context; no clock or deadline shapes Elias's choices. "One dawn" and "weeks prior" are vague temporal markers without urgency. Setup gate is met (timeframe stated early); Development and Payoff are absent (no on-page moment where time pressure alters tactics). The element is setting detail rather than active constraint. Early signal +0.4, causal absence −0.8, swappability (could be "after the war," "after the flood") −0.6 → ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To preserve ancient methods" is stated early ("His motivation burned simple") and recurs in the excavation sequence and ending ("Preservation begun"). Setup and Development gates are met; the motivation drives the search for the cog's twin and the decision to broadcast. Payoff is present but weak: the ending asserts "preservation begun" without showing what Elias risked or forfeited to achieve it. The motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment where preserving methods costs him an alternative he values. Early signal +0.6, two beats (excavation, ending claim) +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, told-only friction −0.7, no visible cost −0.5 → ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is named twice and reflected in the prose's elevated, controlled register even during high-pressure beats. The tone is coherent across the piece but does not modulate meaningfully with escalation: Elias's voice remains the same detached cadence whether discovering the cog, excavating, or reaching closure. Setup gate is met (tone established early); Development shows static application; Payoff is present (ending maintains the tone) but the tone does not charge the final image or reweight prior material. Early signal +0.5, one functional beat (consistent application) +0.4, closure presence +0.4, static mood without pressure shift −0.6 → ~4.7.</comment>
