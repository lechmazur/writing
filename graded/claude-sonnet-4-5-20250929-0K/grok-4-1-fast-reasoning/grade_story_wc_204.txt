<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to compress eternity into a moment") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The uncorking decision feels predetermined rather than earned by visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphysical labels ("negotiable reality," "rustling awakenings") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The final "laughter" and "whispered approval" are asserted emotions without the messy irrationality or visible cost that would ground them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt is significant: who Elias is, where precisely he stands in the library, and the concrete meaning of "after the great unraveling" remain vague past the first 25% (−0.4). The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but causality is murky—frost "decrees," the vial "yields," events cascade without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the library's destruction seeds new orchards), but the cost is abstract: no on-page sentence shows Elias forfeiting a concrete option or feeling a personal price. The "bottled forever" and "moment eternal" are metaphysical claims, not dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vivid and surreal ("crystalline branches bore tomes like fruit"), and the setting does constrain the final action—uncorking the vial triggers the library's physical rupture. Spatial choreography is loose (Elias "descends" but distances and transitions are vague), and the clouds function more as backdrop than active pressure. The frost and the vial are micro-setting elements that participate in beats and the ending, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the lack of occupational or procedural grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's desire to "compress eternity"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost scribes "rupture" and Elias acts, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency facing narrowing options. Coincidence (the frost's decree) initiates the turn; Elias's choice to uncork feels more like fulfilling a script than risking a live tradeoff. Cost is conceptual (the library falls) but not personal or felt on the page in a way that forecloses Elias's own path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (the tension between stasis and rupture, perfect systems and chaos) emerges through image and event rather than overt statement, which is a strength. However, the final image—Elias "fused—moment eternal"—leans toward abstraction and platitude ("Eternity, moment-bound") instead of a resonant particular. The "cryptic broadsides rained down" offers a promising concretization, but the ending's staccato fragments ("Rupture inevitable. Awakenings rustled forth.") edge toward thematic echo and summary rather than earned resonance rooted in the protagonist's arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinct texture ("negotiable reality," "cartography of chaos") and purposeful compression in the final third. Perceptual signature is thin—Elias's way of noticing feels interchangeable with the narrator's rather than character-particular. The piece teaches its lyric, fragment-driven pattern by the final quarter and holds it through closure, so purposeful elision is acceptable. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("rustling awakenings," "negotiable void") that feels more decorative than anchored in Elias's lived interiority, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple patterned artifacts cluster in peak beats: paraphrase loops ("compressed eternity," "rustling awakenings" repeated without added pressure), template cadence in the final fragment sequence, and stock metaphor strings ("eternity's cork," "bottled forever"). The final third's staccato fragments ("Rupture inevitable. Awakenings rustled forth.") are taught but border on ornamental churn rather than propulsive clarity. Information density is uneven—many lines restate the same metaphysical claim. Figurative language is dense without coherent vehicle logic ("whispers erupted in a bottled tempest" mixes liquid and wind). Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, metaphor muddle −0.4; total −1.5 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, plus baseline artifact spread touching closure drops eligibility for high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and the bottled whisper offer fresh sensory specifics, and the premise (reality negotiable, a letterpress operator hoarding permanence) is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc and plot mechanics (prophetic frost, uncork-the-danger-item) lean on familiar fantasy templates without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The "rupture → new orchards" cycle offers a lyric payoff but feels more like thematic assertion than an earned particular. Risk-taking in structure (fragment compression at the end) is present but does not fully compensate for the abstractness of the central conflict.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decision to uncork the vial drives the climax, but the choice feels more scripted by the frost's decree than arising from contradictory internal impulses. He shapes one key turn (the rupture) but his agency is passive—he fulfills a prophecy rather than wrestling with a dilemma. Setup is early, development is functional, and he participates in closure, satisfying two-of-three gates, but causal pressure and cost are conceptual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bottled whisper is introduced in the first third, handled in the middle beat (Elias finds and uncorks it), and triggers the climactic rupture. It shapes two distinct beats and is causally active at closure—the library's destruction hinges on uncorking it. Cost is visible (the vial shatters, the library falls). The object's unique property (containing destabilizing essence) matters, pushing the score into the 7.0+ band. It does not reach 8.5 because Elias's relationship to it is functional rather than layered with personal stakes or evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" appears frequently as a label and thematic phrase but does not constrain or enable on-page choices in a specific, dramatized way. It describes the outcome (books whisper, pages unfurl) after the rupture but does not shape Elias's tactics or decision. The concept is ornamental rather than operational—present and consistent, but replaceable with a near-synonym. Setup and closure mention are present, but middle development as a choice-driver is absent, capping at ~3.4 per the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is introduced early (frost scribes "It destabilizes...") and the library's rupture dramatizes the attribute in action. However, the trait does not constrain Elias's tactics or force a visible tradeoff—he acts to invoke it, not wrestle with it. The attribute shapes one key turn (the rupture itself) and appears in the ending's consequence, satisfying setup and payoff gates. It trends mid-band because the cost is conceptual (the library falls) rather than a personal price tied to the attribute's friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Rupture" is signaled early (frost scribes the word), executed on-page as the vial-neck crack, and redefines all subsequent action—the library's destruction and Elias's transformation hinge on it. It drives at least two beats (the frost's decree and the uncorking) and is indispensable to closure. The action's unique property (sharp, irreversible break) matters. Cost is visible (shattered library, "moment eternal"). High irreplaceability and closure linkage elevate the score into the 8.0+ band, though the action itself is somewhat linear (no tactical friction or complication after it occurs).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" is introduced in the first quarter, guides Elias to seek the vial (middle beat), and is referenced at closure ("Patterns reformed in frost elsewhere"). The method shapes two beats and its mechanics matter—frost scribes prophecy, Elias reads and acts. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. However, the method does not impose cost or complicate tactics; it functions more as convenient oracle than constraint. Causal pressure is moderate (+0.9 for two beats, +0.5 for enabling tactics, −0.3 for ornamental ease), placing it in the upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vividly present throughout, supplies the vial's location (middle beat), and its destruction is the climactic consequence. The setting shapes at least two beats and participates in closure (the fall into clouds, broadsides raining). Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. However, the library does not constrain Elias's choices—it is more stage than friction. Spatial choreography is vague (distances, layout unclear), limiting tactical pressure. The setting's unique properties (floating, crystalline) are descriptive but do not alter Elias's moves, capping in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the great unraveling, when minds could reshape the ether with mere intent" sets the timeframe early, and the post-rupture state is referenced at closure ("Survivors below, negotiating fresh realities"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—Elias has no live clock, no urgency beyond his own declared motive. The timeframe is context rather than constraint. Setup and closure mention are present, but middle development (time pressuring a choice) is absent, capping at ~4.6 per the gate model. Swappability is high (could be "after the war" or "in the age of magic" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To compress eternity into a moment" is stated early as Elias's motive, drives his decision to uncork the vial (middle beat), and is claimed as fulfilled at closure ("Eternity, moment-bound"). The desire shapes one key turn and participates in the ending. However, the motive is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or friction between want and cost on the page. Elias's yearning is declared ("he hungered"), but we never see him wrestle with a competing fear or sacrifice. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but lack of embodied conflict and visible tradeoff limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>
