<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation "to prove that listening heals divides" is told rather than shown through internal conflict. The "sandstorm calm" attribute appears as a label repeated three times without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. Secondary characters (Ruiz, Liang, Tomas, Chen) exist only to deliver clues; no relationship pressure or status dynamics emerge. The ending declares bonds reformed ("Tomas embraced Ruiz, feuds dissolving") without dramatizing the prior friction or showing what was risked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elena is, her curator role, and why she cares about the mailbox emerge across the first 15% without spatial or temporal grounding until "At dawn, she entered." The causal chain from locket → courtyard → stories → code → mailbox resolution reads as outline-level because the storytelling method (hearing clues embedded in tales) is asserted rather than tested against opposition. Closure is a Decisive Change (mailbox opens, letters heal), but the cost is declared ("feuds dissolving") not shown; no path is visibly foreclosed. The "outside world intrudes" timeframe complicates atmospherically but does not narrow Elena's options or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly rendered ("dew-kissed jasmine," "roses unfurling in pinks and golds," "fountain's trickle") and anchors the single-scene action. The locket's "subtle click" and the hidden dial "beneath moss" supply tactile detail. However, the vibrant setting does not constrain Elena's choices—she moves freely from fountain to oak without spatial friction—and the "outside world intrudes" (horns, helicopters) remains auditory decoration rather than a spatial barrier that alters her tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock the mailbox to heal community divides) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation is mechanical: Elena hears four clues in sequence, assembles the code, and succeeds without complication or setback. The "outside world intrudes" introduces external noise but does not force Elena to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The resolution—opening the mailbox and reading letters—lacks agency cost; luck (the correct code) solves the mystery without Elena forfeiting a path or enduring friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme "listening heals" is stated explicitly in Elena's motivation and reiterated in the ending ("listening didn't just solve; it mended the world's hidden locks"). The locket and mailbox function as on-the-nose symbols rather than earning thematic charge through contradiction or ambiguity. The final image—neighbors dispersing lighter, Elena wearing the locket—declares thematic victory without irony or cost. One strength: the courtyard as communal space contrasts with the "outside world's din," grounding the theme in spatial particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization holds; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: "sandstorm calm" and "discerning" appear as labels, not lived syntax. Dialogue from four neighbors reads interchangeably formal ("The locket's chain leads through following the fountain's trickle to the oak's roots"). Template cadence pervades high-pressure beats: "She heard… She rose… She smiled… She lingered… She slipped…" across the final third. The closing "Her work done" narrates rather than trusts the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "Her work done" / "the mystery resolved" / "motivation manifest" / "Thus, the mystery resolved, motivation manifest" restate without adding pressure. Template stems dominate: "Elena [verb]… She [verb]…" in 8+ consecutive sentences from "She rose" onward. Stock metaphors appear without voice filter: "threads drawn to the locket's clasp," "dew dissolving like dew." Mixed vehicle: "sandstorm calm" (desert) applied to a courtyard "vibrant" with "dew-kissed jasmine" (lush). Figurative density in the final paragraph ("curator of more than objects," "stories' method triumphant," "quiet victory") reads elevated without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery and "listening heals" premise follow a recognizable template: community rift + symbolic object + communal storytelling = resolution. The courtyard-at-dawn gathering and the clue-delivery structure (four neighbors, four fragments) reads procedural. One fresh detail: the locket photograph showing "a courtyard gate" bridges object and setting. However, the transformation test fails—swap names and the arc remains unchanged—and the ending's declared healing ("feuds dissolving") lacks the particular cost or surprise that would elevate the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her "discerning" trait is mentioned twice. She makes one on-page decision: entering the courtyard at dawn and turning the dial. However, the curator role does not constrain her choices—she does not curate the stories or select which to trust—and her observation (hearing clues) does not involve trade-offs. Present and functional but largely passive; the storytelling method drives the plot, not her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locket appears in beats across the story: discovered (paragraph 2), opened to reveal the photograph and engraving (paragraph 4), traced by Elena during the storytelling (paragraph 15), offered to Mrs. Liang (paragraph 31), and worn by Elena at closure (paragraph 44). Its "subtle click" and engraved message seed the mystery, and its return at the end as "communal heirloom" reweights it from personal relic to shared symbol. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elena does not risk or sacrifice it, and its mechanics (why the click matters, how it "leads through following") remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox is seeded early ("neighborhood legend," paragraph 5), shapes Elena's goal (unlock it to heal divides), and anchors the climax (dial turn, letters spill, community heals). The mystery drives the storytelling method and the code-assembly escalation. Removing the mailbox would collapse the plot. One weakness: the mystery is external rather than internally conflicted—Elena never doubts the legend or faces a cost to pursue it—so it does not deepen character motive as much as it structures the quest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated twice as a trait and once as thematic gloss ("You led us through following our own voices"). It describes Elena's method (listening passively, then acting) but does not constrain a choice with cost. She does not struggle between leading and following, nor does the attribute narrow her options at a key beat. Present as label, not dramatized as trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hear" / "hearing" / "listening" appears in 12+ beats, from Elena's motivation ("listening heals") to the clue-delivery method (she hears stories) to the thematic closure ("listening endured"). The action is central to the method and drives the code assembly. However, hearing is passive—Elena does not choose what to hear or miss critical sound under pressure—so it lacks the agency cost that would push it above 7.0. Swapping "hear" for "remember" or "notice" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is seeded early ("ritual of neighborhood storytelling under the first light," paragraph 10) and occupies the middle third (four neighbors share tales embedding clues). The method determines how the code is discovered and ties to theme. However, the mechanics are not tested—Elena does not navigate conflicting stories or choose which to trust—and the method does not impose cost. Present across beats and closure-linked, but its specificity (why storytelling vs. direct conversation) is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The courtyard is described vividly in paragraph 9 ("dew-kissed jasmine," "roses unfurling," "fountains murmuring") and anchors the entire scene. The fountain and oak supply spatial waypoints for the clue trail (paragraph 15, 26). However, the courtyard does not constrain Elena's movement or choices—she proceeds unimpeded from center to fountain to oak—and the "vibrant" dawn atmosphere does not shift under the "outside world intrudes" pressure. Setting shapes mood but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is seeded late (paragraph 18, past 25%) and occupies five beats (horns, news vans, sirens, helicopters, radios). It adds auditory texture and thematic contrast (chaos vs. calm) but does not tighten Elena's timeline or force a choice between competing urgencies. The intrusion peaks "as sun crested" near closure but remains external decoration; Elena's pacing is unchanged. Late arrival and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation "to prove that listening heals divides long festering in the community" is stated in paragraph 6 and reprised at closure ("listening didn't just solve; it mended"). It frames her goal and ties to theme. However, the motivation is told rather than tested—Elena does not face doubt, opposition, or a cost that challenges her belief. She succeeds without internal friction, so the motivation shapes the quest but not the character arc. Present, goal-linked, but not dramatized with trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is named three times (paragraphs 11, 19, 33) and gestures toward Elena's steady demeanor under the "outside world intrudes" chaos. The tone attempts contrast (serene interior vs. frantic exterior) but remains static; Elena's calm does not modulate, crack, or cost her anything. The final image repeats "calm" without charging it with new pressure. Present and thematically consistent, but the tone does not evolve or deepen at closure.</comment>
