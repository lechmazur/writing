<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to compile fragments is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His "reactively visionary" trait operates as a label; visions arrive on cue from spray without cost or constraint shaping his choices. The crowd at the ending receives heartening but remains undifferentiated—no individual responds with agency that tests Elias or forces a micro-choice. Interior life consists of stock archivist gestures (kneeling, pocketing, compiling) without embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elias at Ivory Harbor post-exile). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: three trumpet intervals build density and reweight the stake from grief to hope. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("absences were bridges, not breaks"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift grounds the transformation. The crowd disperses "heartened" without a visible price paid by Elias or the community, leaving the closure effect conceptually neat but emotionally inert.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain is vividly rendered (alabaster docks, mist, salt-crusted shelves). The trumpet valve is handled across multiple beats and charges the climax, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias gathers relics and uses the valve without spatial or resource friction. Sensory detail (spray, salt, rain patter) recurs but serves atmospheric backdrop rather than altering tactics at a decision point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: mend the harbor's fractured community. Escalation proceeds through three trumpet intervals that deepen crowd response (gasps → cheers/sobs → lit faces), fitting the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forecloses an option—Elias encounters no resistance, resource limit, or internal doubt that he must overcome. The cost (what he risks or loses by blowing the valve) remains invisible, and the crowd's transformation is told rather than tested through a conflicting choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Absences as bridges, not breaks" emerges from the three intervals and reweights the exile premise. Subtext operates in the visionary sequences (ghost-ships, mist-shrouded isles). Yet the final thematic statement is spoken aloud by Elias in prompt-like language ("absences were bridges") rather than arising implicitly from image and action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The theme avoids simplistic binary but lacks a non-literal final image—Elias "lingering, spray anointing" repeats his starting posture without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ocean-spray triggering visions) but the prose cycles through template stems: "He [verb], [gerund]" across multiple beats. Diction elevates into stock lyric phrasing ("exile's scars softening," "bridges, not breaks") without character-specific idiom. The crowd speaks in collective murmur; no individual voice distinguishes itself, and Elias's speech at the pier reads as thematic declaration rather than goal-driven dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "compile fragments into meaning" / "piecing whispers and relics into a tapestry" / "compiled not just relics but hope" restate the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the three intervals ("First interval... Staggered pause... Second interval... Third interval") with identical syntactic stems. Mixed metaphor: "archive tower...veined with salt-crusted shelves of curated absences" conflates biological, architectural, and curatorial registers incoherently. Figurative density in the climax (spray as "silver veil," valve as "eternal fragment") ornaments rather than clarifies. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated Q7 penalties and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—archivist uses ritual object to heal post-exile community—follows a recognizable template (wise figure + symbolic artifact + collective catharsis). The trumpet valve and spray-vision mechanism are specific but the emotional arc (gathering fragments → public ritual → crowd heartened) proceeds without surprise or moral calculus. "Reactively visionary" and "navigated absences" read as prompt labels rephrased rather than lived constraints. No bold structural risk; the three-interval crescendo is signaled and delivers exactly as advertised.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias gathers relics, uses the valve, and addresses the crowd—present across setup, middle, and ending. However, his choices do not create key turns; he encounters no opposition or cost that forces a decision altering tactics. He observes visions and compiles fragments without dramatized conflict between competing impulses. The valve-blowing is an action he performs, but crowd transformation is told rather than tested, leaving agency ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears early (discovery among flotsam), recurs in the middle (Elias senses its call), and drives the climax (three blown notes). It constrains one choice (Elias must use this specific relic to hearten) and charges the ending ("valve his eternal fragment"). However, the valve's "latent power" is asserted rather than earned through prior cost, and its mechanics (how it summons visions for all) remain unexplained, limiting irreplaceability. Present in all three gates; causal role in climax elevates score but lack of visible cost caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is introduced early as Elias's method and recurs through the visions ("mapping paths the exiles took, voids where they vanished"). It shapes the climax's conceptual resolution ("absences were bridges"). However, it remains thematic rather than tactical—Elias does not navigate in the sense of choosing between paths or paying a cost to access knowledge. The concept frames stakes but does not alter options or constrain a choice on the page, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is labeled early and demonstrates one on-page mechanism (spray triggers visions). However, no cost or constraint is attached—the visions arrive reliably without draining Elias or foreclosing another ability. The trait does not force a tradeoff or enable a choice that another trait could not. It reads as a descriptor of his magic system rather than a character pressure point, capping it below functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hearten" is Elias's goal from early on ("hearten them amid the grief") and the climax enacts it through the three valve notes. The crowd's transformation (lit faces, dispersing forward) is the story's resolution. However, the action is told in summary ("heartened, dispersed") rather than dramatized through a contested choice or visible cost. Swappable with "inspire" or "comfort" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Present in setup and payoff; drives ending but lacks middle friction, placing it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is signaled at the pier ("staggered intervals") and executed in the climax (three trumpet blasts with pauses). The mechanic matters—each interval deepens the vision and crowd response, and the stagger allows collective breath between waves. It shapes the attempt's structure and is irreplaceable (continuous blast would not achieve the same effect). Present in middle and payoff; causal role in climax and specificity of pacing elevate it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain is vivid (alabaster docks, mist, spray) and frames the story from opening to close. The setting provides the spray that triggers Elias's visions (causal enabler) and the central pier as the ritual stage. However, it does not constrain a choice—Elias faces no environmental obstacle (weather, access, resource scarcity) that he must overcome. Present in all three gates; causal role in vision mechanic but no tactical friction, placing it upper-mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" anchors the opening and provides the premise (returnees arriving, absences to mend). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias works "through the afternoon" and performs the ritual "by dusk" without urgency or deadline pressure. The exile's end is a backdrop rather than a live clock altering tactics. Present in setup; thematic role but no tactical constraint, capping it mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is stated early ("his motivation burned steady") and enacted through gathering relics and using the valve. It drives the climax's conceptual resolution (fragments compiled into hope). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Elias never hesitates, doubts, or weighs a cost against his goal. No friction between want and fear; the motivation operates as a thesis rather than a pressure point. Present in all three gates; thematic consistency but lack of internal conflict limits integration.</comment>
