<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation remains abstract label-work ("regrets," "sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "choice" to join her is passive—venom takes him rather than a decision he makes under pressure. Interior life consists of told memories and declarative epiphanies ("debt she sought to repay") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The ghost bride operates as symbolic apparatus, not a character whose choices create friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (bead, veil, venom, fields) accumulate toward a lyric closure. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and why he's alone emerges gradually but the greenhouse anchor holds by ~15%. Fatal flaw: no on-page cost at closure. Elias "collapses," his "spirit resonated, freed"—this is told transcendence, not a Decisive Change with visible price or a Charged Poise that crystallizes options. The bead rolls free "inert," but what path was foreclosed? What did he give up or endure that we see? Closure unit is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid, purposeful detail: twisted trees, venom-apple vine, frost-laced panes, luminous pear. The setting constrains action (he prunes, eats the infused fruit) and the "endless night" frames atmosphere consistently. Spatial choreography holds. However, the setting does not force a choice at closure—it remains backdrop to the transcendence sequence rather than a crucible that narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reuniting across lifetimes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through repeated hauntings and the venom's euphoric advance, but no reversal or deepening occurs; each cameo is a repetition, not a tightening. The climax is passive: venom "unraveled his mortal coil" without a choice that narrows options or a visible trade-off. No cost legibility: what live option did he foreclose? Escalation is atmospheric repetition, not causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice, debt, love across lifetimes—emerges from images (bead, veil, venom, fields) and the premise supplies lyric coherence. The ending offers a non-literal answer: reunited souls, cycle awaiting. However, thematic resonance is undercut by the told transcendence ("freed to join her") and the phrase "debt transcended lifetimes" in the final line, which states the theme rather than letting the image carry it. No ambiguity or complexity; the resolution is tidy satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo"), but register drifts into thesaurus-itis: "resonant awakening" and "cameo" recur as template labels rather than character-specific perception. Elias's perceptual signature is generic alchemist-mystic. Syntax varies, but rhythmic control weakens in peak beats with stacked modifiers and parallel structures that flatten urgency. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence debt: "Over the hush" opens two paragraphs; "resonant awakening(s)" recurs six times; "ephemeral cameo" appears four times as a synonym loop for "appearance." Paraphrase loop: "She vanished…leaving behind mournful elation" / "her form ephemeral, a cameo of swirling mist and sorrowful joy." Filter-verb stacks in climax: "felt her presence," "seemed to mouth," "saw them whole." These artifacts pervade the closure sequence. Figurative density is high without payoff: "loving venom," "mournful elation," "ashen veil" repeat as labels rather than evolving images. Apply artifact penalty pack: −1.4 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—ghost bride repaying a herbalist's failed plague cure across lifetimes—is a recognizable Gothic romance template. The alchemical orchard and "lovingly venomous" framing add texture, but the emotional arc (haunting → transcendence → eternal union) follows a predictable path without a fresh inflection. The bead and venom serve as conventional mystic conduits. No transformation test pass: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. Specificity (venom-apple, carved runes) is ornamental rather than story-altering.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ashen-veil ghost bride: present throughout, but her "choices" are passive hauntings. She appears, brushes a pear, presses lips—actions that happen to Elias rather than decisions that create friction or turns. Setup clear, beats numerous, closure participation present (she envelops him). However, swappability high (any spectral lover), no causal pressure (she does not force a choice he resists), and cost is not tied to her agency. Late-middle band: functional presence without necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Carved stone bead: appears in beat one (tumbles from earth), handled ("clutched," "grew hot"), and recurs at closure ("rolled free, inert"). Three-gate pass: setup, development (triggers memories), closure (gleams, awaiting next soul). Causal linkage modest: it "stirred" awakening but does not constrain a choice. Cost connection weak—the bead's inertness at the end is told consequence, not a trade-off Elias makes. Reprise reweights meaning (cycle continues), but the object is a passive catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings: label recurs six times, shaping stakes (peeling back past lives, visions crashing like waves) and closure (final awakening, spirit resonates). Setup clear, beats involved (memories, visions, transcendence), closure present. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized—"awakenings" describe state changes without on-page choices those states force. Mechanics are vague (what does "resonate" enable or cost?). Mid-band: thematic accent without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Lovingly venomous: appears as descriptor ("loving venom," "lovingly venomous guidance," "embrace lovingly venomous unto death") but never constrains an action with cost. Elias does not choose between love and venom or pay a price for accepting both—he receives the trait passively. Label-only use: the oxymoron charges tone but does not shape a beat. No gate involvement beyond ornamental mentions. Low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ghost (action): present throughout (she appears, glides, presses lips, envelops). Setup immediate, beats multiple (cameos, pear infusion, final embrace), closure direct (she envelops him, they reunite). Causal role clear: her hauntings drive the escalation and deliver the venom. However, swappability moderate—any spectral visitation could serve. Cost legibility weak: Elias does not resist or choose; the action happens to him. Upper-middle band: essential to plot structure but not irreplaceable in method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Through ephemeral cameo appearances: method signaled early ("cameo of swirling mist," "ephemeral cameo appearances," "one cameo lingered longer"). Setup present, beats numerous (multiple appearances), closure participation (she lingers one last cameo). Mechanics matter: her brevity increases longing. However, the method is told via synonym loop ("ephemeral," "cameo") rather than shown through constraint (why can't she stay? what cost does brevity impose?). Functional but told; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night: setup immediate, beats involved (pruning vine, eating infused pear, fruits burst with light), closure present (orchard blooms, pulsed with her venom). Setting supplies resources (luminous pear, venom-apple) and atmosphere (endless night, winter-cracked fields frame). Spatial choreography clear. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Elias does not navigate obstacles or choose between orchard paths. It enriches but does not constrain. Solid middle band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Over the hush of winter-cracked fields: timeframe phrase recurs (opening, midpoint, closure). Setup present, closure framing clear. However, time does not tighten decisions—"days blurred into nights" is vague duration, and no clock forces tactics. The phrase operates as lyric refrain rather than escalation mechanism. Winter persists without progression (fields "cracking further" is atmospheric, not causal). Functional tone-setter but no tactical constraint. Low-middle band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To repay a debt across lifetimes: motivation explicit ("the debt she sought to repay," "her hauntings were that repayment," "debt repaid"). Setup by midpoint, beats involved (visions of plague, vow, repayment through venom), closure direct ("debt repaid," "debt transcended lifetimes"). Causal role clear: the debt drives her hauntings and his acceptance. However, desire is told rather than conflicted—Elias never resists or weighs the cost of accepting her repayment. Friction absent. Upper-middle band: dramatized in backstory but not tested in present choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mournful elation: tone label recurs ("mournful elation," "elated in mourning," "sorrowful joy"). Setup present, closure participation clear (she is "elated in mourning" in final cameo). Tone coherent through turns: sorrow and euphoria layer. However, the oxymoron is stated rather than modulated—no tonal shift under pressure, no cadence change that charges the final image. The tone is declared consistent rather than演olved through rhythm or diction choice. Functional label without embodied intensification. Mid-band.</comment>
