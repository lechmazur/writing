<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to explore is stated but remains abstract; her "gift" is told rather than shown constraining choices under pressure. The decision to enter the rift feels unmotivated—no dramatized internal conflict weighs survival against exploration, and her isolation never translates into embodied emotion that would make the leap credible. The family lore provides backstory texture but doesn't impose a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of "echoed silence," temporal stretch, compass rose), but the closure—Elara stepping through the rift onto alien soil—lacks visible cost; the text asserts "confusion transformed" and "exploration bloomed" without showing what she forfeits or how her options narrow. The rift's discovery via sketch feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causal pressure, and the final image ("True north forever") is more assertion than felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observation deck's temporal dilation is vivid and the setting charges several beats (stars stretched into arcs, the rift revealed through the window). The compass rose and sketchpad function as micro-setting objects that recur and guide action. However, spatial choreography in the final third becomes vague—Elara "approached the window's edge" and "pushed off" without clear mechanics, and the alien soil arrival lacks grounding sensory detail, reading more as concept than place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating isolation post-shutdown—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. The discovery of the rift is not a reversal earned by protagonist choice; it appears as Elara sketches, and she immediately accepts it without friction or second option. No visible price is paid for entering the rift (station abandonment is pre-existing, not a cost she incurs), and the final beat ("she stood on alien soil") lands as fulfillment without trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"True north" as theme emerges through repetition but remains abstract—it's invoked as "life's unerring direction" without being tested against a competing value or forced choice. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("True north had led home to new frontiers") rather than allowing the image to resonate. The compass rose recurs but doesn't shift meaning; it points the same direction throughout, so no reweighting occurs at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, and the perceptual signature (temporal stretch, her "gift" of sensing direction) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("eternities," "echoed triumphs," "defiance of pariah's fate") that clashes with the embodied immediacy the scene demands. The final third accelerates into sentence fragments and repetitive stems ("True north called again. She followed. Word count pulsed...") that flatten voice rather than intensify it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy text-artifact debt: the final third loops through paraphrase ("Blessed pariah no more, explorer eternal. True north called again. She followed.") and template cadence runs ("Temporal echoes faded. Exploration infinite. Silence, her companion..."). Stock metaphors ("stars witnessed all") and the phrase "echoed silence" recurs seven times without evolving function. The pivot beat—sketch revealing the rift—is told in summary ("the sketch revealed patterns") rather than shown, and the final staccato fragments ("Gilded rose spun true. Blessed paths ahead. Stars witnessed all.") read as padding rather than purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" frame and time-dilation setting offer some freshness, but the emotional arc (isolation → discovery → escape) follows a familiar template. The rift's appearance via sketch feels convenient rather than synthesized from prior particulars, and the final image of alien soil lacks the specificity that would make the transformation credible. The compass rose and family custom are present but don't impose a surprising constraint or cost that would elevate the design above median execution.</comment>
