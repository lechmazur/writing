<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elowen remains an abstraction throughout—"witness," "transformed," but never contradictory or embodied. The story asserts motivation ("driven to unravel cosmic illusions") and transformation ("Elowen, transformed, stood at history's true end") without dramatizing internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The dictionary "pulsed" and he "intoned," but no genuine struggle between competing impulses appears on the page. Interiority consists of stock philosophical phrasing rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece offers orientation late (library, Elowen, dictionary visible by paragraph six in a 112-paragraph story) but the larger issue is closure: the final dozen paragraphs declare "illusions vanquished," "unity endured," "peace reigned supreme" without a legible decision or visible cost. The "spiral arbitration" unfolds as exposition—"he arbitrated stars' isolation against their gravitational embrace"—rather than a choice that narrows options. No felt price is paid; the universe simply "knit" and "breathed as one." Under any lens, this is assertion, not demonstrated change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The library is vivid in scattered images: "dust motes danced in shafts of ethereal light," "chambers of crystal scrolls, halls of whispering papyrus," "constellations etched the ceiling lived and breathed." These remain postcard-descriptive and do not constrain Elowen's choices—he walks "wanderingly exact" through infinite shelves without spatial friction. The setting accumulates atmosphere but never forces a tactical decision or supplies a resource that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unifying the cosmos—is declared early, but escalation is absent. Elowen opens the dictionary, reads entries, walks outward/inward, and the universe unifies without reversal, tightening, or cost. The "hiccup" functions as an arbitrary clock rather than a pressure that narrows options. No live decision forecloses a path; the final dozen paragraphs loop through synonyms for resolution ("illusions unraveled," "fractures knit," "unity endured") without demonstrating agency or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (unity beneath multiplicity) is stated repeatedly—"the universe feigned multiplicity, hiding its singular pulse"—rather than emerging from image or choice. The ending declares "illusion vanquished, reality whole" without ambiguity or resonance; no particular action reweights the premise. The softcover dictionary dissolves into "light streams" and reforms as a "compendium of truths," delivering symbolic convenience instead of earned insight. Thematic echo in the final third replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently elevated but generic: "resounding hush," "whispered their last breaths into oblivion," "eternities flashed." Diction remains uniform across emotional registers—Elowen murmurs, intones, and savors without perceptual signature or character-specific syntax. Psychic distance is stable but the prose reads as committee mysticism rather than a singular focalizer's way of noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted but the pattern (inward/outward parallelism) becomes mechanical without teaching a payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The hush resounded triumphant" / "In resounding hush, peace reigned supreme"; "spiral arbitration unfolded" / "Spiral arbitration's verdict"; "walked outward... journeyed inward" repeated across dozens of lines. Template cadence dominates the final third: "He [verb]. The [noun] [verb]. Across [timeframe]…" Figurative language is dense without coherence—"hush resounded," "silent thunder," "breath between cosmic throbs"—and peak beats (the unification sequence) are summarized rather than propelled. These artifacts touch closure directly, warranting the lower band and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—spiral arbitration as a method to unify the cosmos—reads as an original coinage, but execution relies on stock mystical imagery: the ancient library, the witness at history's end, the singular dictionary that holds all answers. The "journeying inward while walking out" is asserted as paradox but not made specific through cost or tradeoff. Turns are not earned in hindsight; the dictionary simply "pulsed" and "decreed" solutions. The transformation test fails: swap "spiral arbitration" for another invented method and the emotional arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elowen, the "end of history witness," is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns. He discovers, opens, reads, walks, and intones—each beat is observational or receptive. The dictionary and the universe act upon him; he arbitrates in narrated summary rather than decision. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary appears early (paragraph six), is handled in multiple beats (lifted, opened, entries read, dissolved into light, reformed), and returns at the end ("placed... on a pedestal"). It shapes the middle sequence—"pages fluttering to 'arbitration'"—and the final image. However, its use is static: it provides exposition rather than constraining choice or imposing cost. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with mid-beat involvement, but swappable with any magical codex.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is named and explained at length but never enacted as a choice with cost. Elowen "arbitrated stars' isolation against their gravitational embrace" in summary; the concept remains thematic echo rather than a tactic that alters options. Late in the piece it is declared as verdict, not dramatized as method. Present as label, absent as driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" is coined in paragraph five ("His steps echoed softly, a wanderingly exact rhythm—precise in memory, meandering in path") and recurs three times, always as descriptor. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; Elowen's path is asserted as both precise and meandering but this duality never forces a tradeoff or alters outcome. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unify" is named as the goal early and restated in the climax ("To unify," he intoned). The final sequence depicts cosmic unification ("fractures knit; stars realigned"), so the action participates in closure. However, it is summarized rather than turned by protagonist decision—Elowen speaks the word and the universe complies. The action is present at closure but does not redefine options through choice; it could be replaced by "harmonize" or "integrate" with minimal structural change. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The method "journeying inward while walking out" is named in paragraph ten and illustrated throughout: "He walked outward, aisles unfolding endlessly... Yet inward he journeyed, eyes tracing dictionary definitions." It recurs in the final third and is restated at closure ("Journeying inward while walking out had bridged all divides"). The method shapes the middle sequence's structure—alternating physical and introspective beats—but never imposes a cost or forces a tactical choice. It is a motif rather than a means that constrains or enables; swappable with "balancing opposites" or similar. Two gates (setup, closure echo), mid-beat illustration, but ornamental causally.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is anchored early and supplies vivid details (spiral staircase, crystal scrolls, dome with living constellations). Elowen traverses its "endless shelves" and "outward expanses," and the library "stabilized" at the end as "timeless anchor." The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance but does not constrain a choice—Elowen encounters no locked doors, missing volumes, or spatial friction. It is backdrop rather than pressure. Setup and closure presence earn mid-band; lack of tactical constraint caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" is named early as "that infinitesimal pause where all potential converged" and repeated throughout ("The library trembled faintly, time's fabric hiccuping"; "Across the universe's hiccup, eternities flashed"). It bookends the story but never functions as a ticking clock that alters moves—Elowen completes his task within the hiccup without urgency or cost tied to time running out. Present as refrain, absent as escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is stated in paragraph three and restated: "Elowen's motivation burned—to expose how the universe feigned multiplicity." It drives Elowen's search for the dictionary and his use of it. However, the motivation is told and re-told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. No moment shows Elowen weighing the price of unraveling or fearing failure. Setup and thematic presence, but label-only in execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" is coined in the opening line and recurs eleven times, modulating slightly: "a wanderingly exact rhythm," "a thread in the resounding hush," "hush resounded louder," "hush resounded triumphant," "In resounding hush, peace reigned supreme." The tone is coherent and charges the final image ("The resounding hush's profound embrace"). However, the single static mood—reverent, mystical quiet—does not shift meaningfully under pressure; it remains an atmospheric overlay rather than a tonal arc. Strong early signal, closure linkage, but limited modulation caps higher bands.</comment>
